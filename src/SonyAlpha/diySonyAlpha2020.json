This lens predates the AI aperture ring, and also has a 72mm filter diameter.\n\nPosing this question to long-time Nikon shooters, or even people who have done a DIY AI conversion process on a Pre-AI lens.\n\nI bought a used 20mm f/3.5 Nikkor-UD lens with good glass, and good mechanicals. The only problem is that this particular copy has a improper aperture ring modification. \n\nThe previous owner of my lens attempted to do his own AI conversion by shaving off several mm of the bottom of the aperture ring. Because there was nothing left on the aperture ring to catch onto the aperture coupling ring, the former owner drilled a tiny screw into the aperture ring. \n\nThe problem is that the screw is a few mm off from where it should be for a lens with f/3.5 maximum aperture. When I open this lens to maximum aperture, or even f/4, the screw doesn't catch onto the aperture coupling ring until I stop the lens down to f/5.6. The result is that I can't meter reliably if the lens aperture is opened wide. I think this is a rather serious limitation. \n\nI've thought about what to do about this problem. I've considered working around the problem by using this lens on a Nikon F3 or Nikon F4 with the metering tab flipped up. This method allows me to shoot this lens with stop-down metering. I suppose I could also only use the lens at  f/5.6 or higher, but this is also very limiting. \n\nAs for fixing the problem, I'm not sure if it's worth the time. I've come up with three possible fixes:\n\n1. Re-drill the screw into the right spot\n2. Swap the aperture ring with another one\n3. Find Nikon's specific AI conversion kit, and install that in place of the original aperture ring\n\nI'm not comfortable with the idea of drilling a second hole into the aperture ring, as I have no experience doing so. The second and third options don't seem very feasible either; I would somehow have to find a spare aperture ring for this lens which is unlikely nowadays. The third option is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, because Nikon stopped making the AI conversion kits several decades ago.\n\nAny thoughts on this problem would be greatly appreciated.

New to the subreddit. Kinda new to reddit in general. I have a couple of questions that are kinda long!\n\n**QUESTION 1: CURSED EKTACHROME?**\n\nI've been developing and scanning my own film for about two and a half months now, started off with C-41 and moved onto E-6 about a month ago. Fell in love with slides, but they were too expensive...swallowed the cost of a few rolls of 35mm Provia, Velvia 50, and Ektachrome until I found a source of some expired 120mm Ektachrome 100 from 2006. Figured this was a good excuse to get into medium format while I was at it. \n\nI shot the 35mm stuff with an XD11. Eager to try out the medium format film, but without an actual camera yet (I had actually bought the film and shipped it to my friend so we could use his Mamiya 645 while I visited, but this didn't work out) I decided to test a roll out on a......Holga 120N. I know...but I thought, expired film, toy camera, how appropriate.\n\nI had successfully developed one roll of Provia off of one set of [these chemicals](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1362747-REG/freestyle_photographic_11861_arista_rapid_e_6_slide.html), then after letting them sit in the bottles for too long before developing another roll (I got busy with finals), I decided to throw out the bottles to avoid ruining my pictures. So, with fresh chemicals, I developed five rolls of film. I have a two-roll Patterson hand tank. I developed them as follows:\n\n* Two rolls of Provia. These came out absolutely fine.\n* A roll of Velvia 50 and Ektachrome. These came out with contrasting casts (the Velvia was slightly magenta and the Ektachrome was greenish. Weird.)\n* A roll of the Ektachrome in question, which came out like...\n\n![video](kzglw75ulb431 \"Was expecting wonky images. Was not expecting this.\")\n\nSo obviously, I figured that the Holga, being leakier than the Titanic, just completely let the film go blank. That or I overexposed the film, but seeing as I rated it at ISO 38 and shot on a partly cloudy day, this seems unlikely (if anything, I underexposed it).\n\nI decided that if I wanted to shoot medium format, I'd want to do it right. So I picked up a Fuji(ca) GW690(I) from eBay (in Exc+++ condition) last week. Shot it yesterday. With the Ektachrome. Rated it at ISO 38. Thought to myself, *Good! Let's see how this goes!*\n\nI don't have a picture of how it turned out because I immediately thew it away in anger. It came out the same as from the Holga.\n\nI thought that exposure to light after taking the roll out of the camera might have done something, but with the roll that came from the GW690 I literally took it from the camera to the changing bag I use to load film into the tank like...basically immediately. My friend thought it was something with the developer or errors in my process, but I keep a good eye on temperature, I don't mix up bottles of solution, I wash well between steps...etc. \n\nI'm gonna shoot a roll of Provia today to see if it's just the stock itself being iffy, but how likely is that? Are there any glaring errors in what I've done that'd lead to this? I bought the offending rolls from [here](https://www.filmwholesale.com/), and these folks have yet to let me down (in fact, their expired rolls of Fujicolor 100 from 2010 and their rolls of Supra 400 from ??? (I'm guessing 2003) have worked out incredibly well for me in the past).\n\n**QUESTION 2: E6 AGITATION PATTERNS?**\n\nLike I said above, I use [this kit](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1362747-REG/freestyle_photographic_11861_arista_rapid_e_6_slide.html) to develop at home. The thing is, the instructions for agitation in this kit, unlike its C-41 counterpart, are kinda confusing, and I dunno, I might be dumb, but I don't exactly know how to interpret this:\n\n&gt;Agitation is critical for properly developed film. Keep your agitation consistent...Except for the wash steps use the following agitation procedure for all the steps: After adding the chemicals to the tank and tapping, agitate by inverting the tank to the left then right and twisting left and right *vigorously* for the first 15 seconds of the processing. Then repeat the agitation technique once every 30 seconds.\n\nSo far, I've taken this to mean 15 seconds of just going ballistic and letting your tank have it every 30 seconds, but I don't quite know how to space it. I've tried finding videos of people doing it, but since everyone speeds it up, or uses a different set of chemicals which only makes use of the spinny rod, I've decided to ask actual people. I made two charts:\n\n![img](rpd5ubeurb431 \"Figure one?\")\n\n![img](u5dxorcosb431 \"Figure two?\")\n\nGreen is time spent shaking the hell out of the tank, the numbers represent when on the stopwatch an agitation starts, the red indicates stop time (and the multiple stop times on the first developer represent extension to compensate for chemical exhaustion).\n\nLike both work, but I'm afraid pattern one has been overdoing it, but pattern two might be introducing my color shifts (and also blanking out old Ektachrome??? Maybe????)\n\n**TL;DR:** Bought some [120mm Ektachrome 100](https://www.filmwholesale.com/products/kodak-epp-120-film-slide-wholesale) from 2006 which came out clear after souping it myself, despite previous successful attempts on other film stocks, after shooting it from both a Holga 120N AND a Fuji GW690. Also, I don't know how to agitate E-6 chemistry properly.

I\u2019m looking to your expertise for a little buying advice.  I\u2019m looking for an introductory level mirrorless camera.  In about 1 year I will be starting my career (fresh out of training).  As such, I won\u2019t have the money to hire a professional photographer, so it will be mostly DIY.  I have limited photography skills other than using the phone on my camera, but I am definitely interested in educating myself and upping my game.  My budget is $1500 USD.  The primary use will be for my work.  I will be taking patient photos which can occur pre-op, intra op, and post op.  The photos are required for my board certification process, but will also be used for examples of my work to show prospective patients.  For the board certification my phone is probably sufficient quality but I would like to have higher quality to show my patients.  I may also use the camera for short Instagram or Facebook type videos as well.   I\u2019ve looked at the Sony A6100 and the Fugifilm X-T30.  Both seem in my budget for the cost of the body, but I\u2019m not sure what type of lenses or accessories would be recommended.

It has been nice for the most part. But if it has been dormant for a while, the first firing gets stuck half-way through taking a photo. The aperture stops down, the mirror lifts, and then... nothing. Usually the meter reading in the display also freezes and continues to display whatever it was when I hit the shutter release. I can sometimes force it to complete firing by moving the shutter speed dial to one of the mechanical settings, but that doesn't really solve the problem. Obviously, this situation is irritating.

I really need some help, or at least an advice.\n\nLONG STORY SHORT, the power source (battery) detached from the camera while it just started buffering. And now does not even turn on.\n\nA couple of months ago I got myself an extremely rare panasonic vhs camcorder from 1985. It was in a perfect working condition, included stuff like battery pack charger, socket plug, and 2 12V battery packs (that of course do not hold any charge as they are 30+ years old).\n\nI found a way to \u201cfix\u201d the battery packs (i needed battery packs so i could film outside etc). So, I ordered a new 12V drill battery for \u00a330 off ebay. Disassembled one of battery packs, detached old insides and rewired a new drill battery to it.\n\nI rewired it properly (positive to positive contact, and vice versa). HOWEVER i havent fixed the new battery on the old case before testing it out. This is where i cocked up.\n\nSo i attached a DIY battery pack onto the camera back and turned it on. JUST AS it started working (i heard sounds, it was actually buffering), the battery pack literally fell off. And detached from contacts. Meaning, while the camera was operating and setting up to turn on, the source of electricity suddenly detached.\n\nMy issue is: the camera does not turn on anymore. Not even if i plug it in the socket directly, not even if i use both DIY battery pack and the plug.\n\nWhat do i do now? I really, really love this camcorder and i cant accept such a loss tbh.

Currently I'm using the Sigma 16mm f/1.4 and the Sony 35 mm f/1.8. \n\nThey are brilliant lenses, though I do want something with a bit more reach and \"flattening\", for both portraits as well as city detail shots. \n\nThe go-to portrait lens on APS-C Sony bodies seems to be the 50mm f/1.8 OSS. I tried a friend's copy the other day, and it's a nice lens, but I didn't get the impression that it was doing anything my 35mm f/1.8 couldn't already do with some cropping. And for anything outside of portraits, I often either found it too long or too short. \n\nIt is cheap though, and a long focal length wouldn't be my daily shooter (the 16 or 35 would still be my walk-aroundds). So from a cost to actual use perspective, it seems like the right choice. \n\nHowever, the FE 85mm f/1.8 is also interesting. I'm not sure if the focal length would be crazy limiting on APS-C (127.5mm equivalent), but it seems like that ~135mm length on full-frame is often used for portraits. This lens also seems like a bokeh monster. \n\nMy questions about it are:\n\n* How far back do you need to stand to get a waist-up portrait on APS-C?\n* How far back do you need to stand to get a full-body portrait?\n* If you have to be really far back, do you find yourself limited by lighting? Since things like the pop-up flash with a DIY diffuser might be too far to be useful\n* Is the lack of OSS a huge limiter for getting clear shots, especially in the evening/night. \n\n\nMy other qualm about the 85 is the price. I know it is generally considered great value for FF bodies, but I feel like it would be my least used lens (probably only about 15-20% of the time), and $550 would be my most expensive lens. \n\nOne other option is to wait for a new Sigma APS-C release - I heard that after the 16 f/1.4 and 30 f/1.4, Sigma plans to release a short-telephoto f/1.4 lens, but it's unclear what the time frame of release would be.

With cosplay its kind of the norm to edit the shit out of your photos and I will admit I edit mine to look more comicy, since I cosplay comic characters and all, but I don't go to the extremes. I've been learning to edit photos and while I'm not a pro, I have decent skills. When I started learning analog recently with my Polaroid I read up on some forum posts and the main consensus was: just fix the contrast, exposure, and brightness of photos if the scans are dark. And when I edit my Polaroids I have them right next to me so I can try to get as  true of a  color match as possible and I'm not altering the image any just fixing the scan if it's too dark.   \n\n\nRight now I'm exploring 35mm and have basically a point and shoot camera I found at a thrift store. I did a test with some cheap Fuji Film I got at Walmart to make sure it worked and the photos turned out absolutely gorgeous! Right now I'm getting a roll of film developed from a show I went to on the 2nd and it was my first time shooting with film that was 800 ISO. So when I get these back and find the good ones to give to the bands I took photos for I don't know if I should edit the digital copies or leave them raw and unedited.    \n\n\nI spoke to a few photographers in my local scene and only one shoots film. They said they only fix the saturation and exposure when needed. Majority of the others edit their photos to fit a certain aesthetic and all.   \nSo what this rambling post boils down to is:  What's kind of the consensus with editing analog photos? Are they supposed to have the raw unedited look to them or is it okay to edit them like you would a digital photo? Does it take away from the authenticity of them to edit them?   \nI know every photographer is different but hearing back from a community may help since  I'm still really new to all of this.   \nThank you all in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/q8hdip/editing_photos_do_or_dont/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "editing photos: do or don't? /!/ hi!   \nstill a bit of a newbie at analog and i have a question that i'd like to hear some feedback on. \n\nso for a few years now i've been doing photography on my phone digitally for cosplay and concerts/-----> diy !!!  shows. with cosplay its kind of the norm to edit the shit out of your photos and i will admit i edit mine to look more comicy, since i cosplay comic characters and all, but i don't go to the extremes. i've been learning to edit photos and while i'm not a pro, i have decent skills. when i started learning analog recently with my polaroid i read up on some forum posts and the main consensus was: just fix the contrast, exposure, and brightness of photos if the scans are dark. and when i edit my polaroids i have them right next to me so i can try to get as  true of a  color match as possible and i'm not altering the image any just fixing the scan if it's too dark.   \n\n\nright now i'm exploring 35mm and have basically a point and shoot camera i found at a thrift store. i did a test with some cheap fuji film i got at walmart to make sure it worked and the photos turned out absolutely gorgeous! right now i'm getting a roll of film developed from a show i went to on the 2nd and it was my first time shooting with film that was 800 iso. so when i get these back and find the good ones to give to the bands i took photos for i don't know if i should edit the digital copies or leave them raw and unedited.    \n\n\ni spoke to a few photographers in my local scene and only one shoots film. they said they only fix the saturation and exposure when needed. majority of the others edit their photos to fit a certain aesthetic and all.   \nso what this rambling post boils down to is:  what's kind of the consensus with editing analog photos? are they supposed to have the raw unedited look to them or is it okay to edit them like you would a digital photo? does it take away from the authenticity of them to edit them?   \ni know every photographer is different but hearing back from a community may help since  i'm still really new to all of this.   \nthank you all in advance!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 48682, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "goodvibes_alacarte", "date": "2021-09-20 00:29:59", "content": "Nikon FE rewind fix DIY /!/ Hi!

Since I usually use all my machines  holding them around my neck for safety, I started looking for a replacement. I learned quickly that the machine used a proprietary pressure heads that are currently no longer marketed: this obviously in theory restricts the use of only original shoulder straps which for this reason are sold used at very high prices. So I tried to understand if there could be a not too DIY alternative on the market. After a fairly intricate search for information, I decided to trust the few opinions found online and I bought the model B of OP/Tech USA pro connectors (those with a square hole to be clear) even if the model A is recommended on the manufacturer's website for Zenzas.\n\nThe hooks fit perfectly and are much safer than (at least to me) it seemed from the product photos. They consist of two parts: the first, that is the lower one, is the perforated one that must be inserted around the pin on the machine, while the second, that is the upper one, once positioned goes under the pin head to prevent it from accidentally coming out. To release the connector, it is just necessary to grab the two side tabs of the top and lift it, in order to free the head of the pin.

The ISO/ASA setting on your camera doesn't change how sensitive the film is; it can't. It is only for the camera's internal meter. You're telling the camera how to help you expose the film properly. But if you have already shot the whole roll at the wrong ISO, you can ask the lab to push or pull the development for you to match (or just develop normally and live with it) \n2. Overexposing Portra is not pushing. That is called 'rating'. Rating is where you shoot the film as if its sensitivity is different than what's stated on the box, and then develop *normally.* You rate the film as being slower than it actually is. You're technically over-exposing, but you don't change development, so you end up with a denser negative. \n3. Pushing changes both exposure and development. To push film, you underexpose your shots, and then increase development time to compensate. Pulling is the opposite: you overexpose, and then cut your development time. Pushing increases contrast and reduces shadow detail, and lets you shoot the film at greater speed. \n4. To find out what other people are spending on the camera you want, search the completed auctions on eBay. Most of the people you ask 'what should I spend for this camera?' are doing that. \n5. To find out what lenses go with your camera, search \"\\[name of camera\\] + lens mount\" \n6. To find out anything else about your camera's operation, search \"\\[name of camera\\] + manual' \n7. Vertical red-orange bands across your film are light leaks. Huge white areas on the first shot of the roll mean you should wind a little more before taking your first shot, because your first shot was partially aimed at the exposed leader. \n8. If you bought a manual-only SLR like the K1000 and aren't sure how to set the dials, google \"sunny 16\". If you want to know why those numbers work, google \"exposure triangle\". \n9.

If you're into Polaroid and want to have more control over the exposure, buy an SX-70\n16. If you're not sure what black and white film to buy but you like grain, buy Ilford HP5+. If you want a grittier, higher-contrast look, buy Tri-X 400. If you want less grain, buy Ilford Delta 100 or Kodak T-Max 100. \n17. If you're not sure what color film to buy, but you like nice soft colors, buy Portra 400. If you want to spend less money, buy Kodak Gold or Ultramax. \n18. If you want crazy grain and want to take pictures in low light, buy Kodak P3200 T-Max or Ilford Delta 3200. You should rate them at box speed, but know that may lose shadow detail in dynamic scenes. \n19.

/!/ Personally, it has to be products. It may be the most straight forward starting point for alot of people, since your subject never move, and you could always shift and play with your light in whatever way you want, but god is it hard to achieve a specific look you want. I feel like there's so much more variables, because every product, has a vastly different shape. Its not like say, humans, while we might have different size or height, we'll still look pretty similar physically, and photographing a round object vs a square object isn't the same.   \n\n\nThen you got all your different lighting set ups. You got flags, reflector boards, foamcore boards, diffusion panels, and so many more equipment that helps you shape light on the subject. You move your light slightly?

I used it three times before the pandemic: at my own wedding, and then two holiday parties. It's still a work in progress, but hopefully this can help / inspire someone to get their own set up. \n\nCamera: Kind of irrelevant, but I know someone will ask. This picture was with a 7D mkII and 10-22mm, I think at 22mm (I just have the JPG and not in front of my LR catalog right now), f/8 and 1/200. I liked the wide angle look for the photo booth, even though I wouldn't normally use it for portraits, but this setup would really work with whatever you have. \n\nLights: Really just one big key light. I ganged up two 580EX ii and one 430EX ii in a triple flash umbrella bracket (inexpensive Impact from B&amp;H), in a Neewer 48\" Octabox (Amazon). Set it up on-axis and as high as I could given the ceilings in a given setup, angled down as needed to hit the subjects. Triggering was a third 580EX ii in the hot shoe. Theoretically could've used the 7D's built-in flash as the master, but with the other speedlites in a softbox, they don't see the triggering light as well, and I was able to actually tuck the 580 into the bottom of the softbox (it's a velcro front panel). I've also just bought the Phottix Laso triggering system, so in future uses I'll use radio. \n\nSetup: Background is something cheap I got on Amazon. Background stand is an Impact kit from B&amp;H.  Camera was mounted on a tripod and snugged up under the softbox, so roughly at head height, with a remote shutter release hung over a light stand near the subjects and a 3 second delay. This gave the subjects time to hit the shutter release, put it down, and pose before the picture was taken. I found the wired shutter release more reliable than the little infrared RC-6; if you have a bluetooth-capable camera the new bluetooth remote (BR-1?) might work better. It might also wander off if you don't tie it down... Anyway. Camera was shooting tethered with Lightroom CC, saving photos to a specific folder on the laptop. This folder was monitored by a free slideshow app I found, which would display the new photo full-screen as soon as it saw a new one, and then resume cycling through the other photos that had been taken that evening. In later implementations, I also synced the folder to my web server, and put a QR code on the \"Photo Booth instructions\" poster, so that people could go straight to that page and download their photos to their phones in real time. \n\nRegrets: Using TTL. I'm used to using it because I'm usually pretty mobile, and it didn't really occur to me that the lighting conditions weren't changing at all here. (I'm using the excuse that the first implementation was my own wedding and this was a very low priority, and after that I was on autopilot). The TTL got tricked by different costumes, and even different poses blocking or exposing more reflective parts of the sequined background, and I ended up with some over- or under-exposed shots. Next time it'll be manual flash. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, C&amp;C totally welcomed.

I picked up a dirt cheap Minolta X-700 \"for parts\" because I want to learn more about camera repair and how to fix some common issues. **I want to learn how to fix this myself**, so please don't recommend bringing it to a shop for repairs - I would have done that already if I wanted to.\n\n**Some background:** The camera has fresh batteries in it and it beeps when setting it to the audible \"on\" mode in a dark environment, so I know it's getting power. I was able to fire off one shot, but after doing so, the mirror was stuck in the up position. Upon looking at the shutter curtain, it looked like it hadn't fully advanced, and I could see a bit of metal at the left side. I gently pushed it over just a touch, and the mirror came back down on its own. I cranked the film advance lever and all seemed well.\n\n**Here's my issue:** I can no longer fire another shot. I noticed that when I crank the film advance lever, the spool/sproket spins so it does actually advance the film, but the curtain only advances a centimeter or two. Once the lever gets to the end of its action and I return the lever to its original position, the curtain also returns to its previous position, and doesn't complete a cycle. It then gets stuck in its slightly-off position, and I have to gently push it back into place.
