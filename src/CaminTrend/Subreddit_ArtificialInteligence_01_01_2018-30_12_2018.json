All of these models are tested on -----> image !!!   recognition, which is a single -----> image !!! .(Note- The dynamics changes when it  is video rather than -----> image !!! ). This would mean that all these  networks that are primarily worked for either image recognition or natural language, consider spatial relationships only. Since the time factor is static, in an image, the  need to do time based analysis does not arise  \u00a0 \n\nBut, Cellular behavior or behavior related to molecular interactions  cannot be analyzed just by spatial parameters. This may help in giving  the structural inputs but does not lend towards functional analysis of the cell or molecule. We will need to  factor in how each parameter changes by time and hence requires temporal  data parameters. Moreover, in chemical interactions, since there is a decay, it needs both space and time calculations in order to understand the  behavior and influence of a unit molecular input \u00a0 \n\nWe also find that the networks require a manually prepared data-set or if unsupervised, it creates a fully  connected network.

In marketplaces like* ***Ubcoin Market*** *listings (ads) are created and posted by users of the service. Among the legitimate ones some are posted by scammers. To search and identify listings posted by scammers, the* ***Ubcoin Market*** *team developed a solution based on artificial intelligence technologies. It identifies suspicious ads, reveals duplicate ads, low-cost ads, abnormal ads and finds weird user behavior patterns in the data. The use of machine learning algorithms makes the purchasing and selling of goods for cryptocurrency on the* ***Ubcoin Market*** *safe and secure.*\n\nAdvertisements posted by scammers may barely differ from usual legitimate ads, which makes preliminary moderation using the involvement of human experts ineffective. The algorithms utilized by Ubcoin artificial intelligence solution finds obscure patterns of behavior of scammers and instantly identifies suspicious ads.\n\n**The Ubcoin team identifies four types of fraudulent ads:**\n\n1) Duplicate ads, with changed details or contacts\n\n2) Ads, with a low price, for the mass attraction of buyers\n\n3) Multiple ads placed by one user from different accounts\n\n4) Ads containing abnormal content or abnormal user behavior when posted\n\n**To identify duplicate ads** **Ubcoin Market** uses its own solution for the analysis of texts and images. Natural language processing algorithms such as Word2Vec translate text into a vector and define the same meaning even when using substitute words. A solution for -----> image !!!  analysis reveals duplicate -----> image !!! s and select objects on them.\n\n**To identify ads with a low price,** a solution is used to automatically determine the optimal price for the product. The solution utilizes real historical data regarding the cost of placement and the sale of goods. The solution is based on the algorithm for highlighting the topic of the ad and the characteristics of the product specified in the ad. If the cost of the goods is understated and falls into the left 5% interval of the price distribution histogram, this is a sign for additional verification.\n\n**To detect multiple ads placed by one user from different accounts,** both the data received when a user visits the site and the data from the ad are used. The algorithms for clustering are used to reveal the hidden structure in the data. The approach reveals obscure behavioral factors. An example of the operation of the clustering algorithm: clusters are marked with colors. When finding a cluster in which fraudulent ads predominate, a classification algorithm is trained based on the information received, which automatically detects suspicious ads in the future.\n\nAdditionally, a solution is used to search for anomalies in the data. The solution is based on the one-class algorithm of the method of support vectors. Search for anomalies is designed to search for ads that are very different in their own structure or the nature of the user\u2019s behavior from the bulk of the ads. The solution finds ads posted by bots, and automatically sends them for additional verification.\n\nThe peculiarity of revealing fraudulent actions is that people who aspire to commit unlawful actions quickly **adapt to new ways of counteraction, changing behavior.** To solve this problem, artificial intelligence **Ubcoin Market** will undergo regular retraining on new data, and the analysts and developers will continuously improve solutions to identify suspicious transactions.\n\nThe decision of the **Ubcoin Market** to identify suspicious ads is based on modern machine learning algorithms and identifies duplicate ads, low-price ads, abnormal ads and user behavior patterns.

Personal recommendations increase the conversion of sales by showing users products or services that users are most likely interested in purchasing. The introduction of system\\-generated personal recommendations raises the revenue of the partners of the service, and makes finding goods more convenient for the clients. The system effectively creates an environment where users spend more time on the service, make more purchases, and all the while inspect only products relevant to the users themselves. The implementation of a system that creates personal recommendations leads to an increase in marketplace revenues, as well as an increase in the loyalty of buyers and sellers.\n\nThe value and effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by Netflix, when in 2006 it held a competition that changed the idea of the value of the available information about the client. The company was faced with the task of increasing the conversion of content purchases and improving the customer\u2019s customer experience. Netflix organized a contest with a prize fund of $ 1 million. At the end, by investing $ 1 million, Netflix got the effect and benefits of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe Ubcoin team, understanding the importance of personal recommendations, began developing its own solution.\n\nThe Ubcoin solution is based on machine learning technologies, on the algorithms of collaborative filtering. Regarding the traditional machine learning approach, features and an objective function are fed into the input, then the collaborative filtering features are contained both in the object that is the advertisement and in the user data. On a similar principle, search algorithms work on the Internet, where information is used both about the site, and about the user and the search query.\n\nFor Ubcoin tasks, characteristics of the object are analyzed, such as the text of the description of the goods and the -----> image !!!  of the goods. To describe the product image, Ubcoin uses pre\\-trained AI in conjunction with the neural network regarding the ImageNet images and pre\\-trained in product images. The task of the neural network is to recognize the specific objects in the image.\n\nFor the extraction of features from the text, a selection of topics based on classification and clustering of text ads are systematically used. For this, the text is translated into a vector by using the TF\\-IDF algorithm.\n\nThen, the text goes through the procedure of normalization and lemmatization, after which algorithms of logistic regression and random forests are used. To determine the significance of words, the algorithm Word2Vec is used. Word2Vec translates words into a vector form which allows it to perform mathematical operations on them.\n\nThe solution works as follows: the user places ads on the Ubcoin platform. Artificial intelligence analyzes user information, ad parameters, ad text, image, and how other users viewed and interacted with this ad and other ads. Based on the generated information, a prediction model is constructed, effectively predicting which ad will appeal to a specific user.\n\nThe **Ubcoin** team makes a crypto\\-to\\-goods exchange platform for exchanging goods for cryptocurrency, using modern algorithms of artificial intelligence, helping users find the product of interest. Now, only users decide what is needed.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/8s2cam/personal_recomendations_based_on_the_artificial/"}, {"autor": "emarketeducation", "date": "2018-11-06 05:32:25", "content": "HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AFFECTS THE DIGITAL MARKETING /!/  \n\n# Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing &amp; Career in Digital Marketing in 2018\n\nImpact of Artificial intelligence (AI) is conquering each sector one by one.

A Computer can do tasks that normally require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and translation between languages.\n\n**Knowledge has a Beginning**\n\n**But No End**\n\n[***Check Out What\u00a0eMarketeducation\u00a0DeliversThe Best Digital Marketing Courses in Bangalore***](http://www.emarketeducation.in/course/digital-marketing-training-course-bangalore/)\n\n## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN DIGITAL MARKETING CAREER\n\nManual handling of the digital world becomes difficult in understanding, analyzing and analyzing data and sometimes even gives wrong results. The introduction of **Artificial Intelligence in the digital advertising industry shifted made more reliable sector** as it is capable to understand human behaviour and vital part for marketers to engage with customers. Marketers are aware of the **AI impact in the online marketing** field. The entrance of machine intelligence helps online marketers to make the decision on posting advertisement as they can understand the market and audience reaction deeply.\n\nA digital marketer can use computer intelligence to enhance sale growth, develop the engagement with customers and target the audience.\n\n## \n\n## 10 ADVANTAGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HOW IT AFFECTS DIGITAL MARKETING.\n\n1. **Application of Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing**\n\n**AI helps to Understand Audience Requirement Easily**. The major role of the marketing sector is realizing customer\u2019s need and his attitude. If the organization can understand customer\u2019s requirement, it is easy to advertise and segment the market accordingly, increase the sale volume and minimize the advertising expense if they could understand what customers require.\n\nArtificial intelligence brings you customers\u2019 behaviour and how they react to the products and services.\n\n1. **AI helps to Improve the Customer Satisfaction**\n\nAI implement connection with the audience. Knowing customer queries and solving the **issues is the key factor of online marketing strategy** that helps to engage with customers, understanding their requirement and develop products and services accordingly. On time conversation with consumers enhances reliability and builds customers loyalty. [A chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot) is used to have a two-way real-time conversation that brings more engagement with customers.\n\nThis application support customers through chatting in real-time and collect relevant data from users which helps the brand targeting potential customers and marketing products.\n\n1. **Helps in Content Marketing**\n\nAI creates content. In Online\u00a0Marketing, [**content strategy is very important**](http://www.emarketeducation.in/content-marketing-believe-basics/). Using certain tools programs Artificial Intelligence can convert data into written content in the different format such as article, -----> image !!! , video and production descriptions.\u00a0 AI can produce 2000 articles per second based on requirement.\n\nMany of esteemed companies like Samsung, Yahoo are already started using automated content writing technology.\n\n1. **AI helps in High Return on Investment (ROI) in Digital Marketing**\n\nA company can make huge ROI rate as they can target specific customers with AI-based tools. Artificial intelligence enabled software can recognize the human face and his characters. Image recognition by AI tool can be leveraged to know customers\u2019 behaviour, interest, and need.\n\nThis will help the digital marketer to focus on potential customers and minimize the advertising cost.\n\n1. **Artificial Intelligence Makes Digital Advertising More Effective**\n\nAdvertising is an inevitable part of promoting the brand.\u00a0 But organization incur lose as audience receive the advertisement which is not related to his requirements.\u00a0 The brand can avoid unnecessary advertisement targeting potential customers with the help of AI as it collects, analyze and predict the behaviour of the user. \u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **AI helps to create a personalized user experience**\n\nA business can achieve success when they can engage with customers personally. This will help them to understand what the user prefers and how a consumer satisfies with the products. Artificial intelligence would collect the users\u2019 data such as customers\u2019 searches, buying behaviour, interest and other relevant information about the customers. This would help the organization to understand the customers properly. A chatbot is a tool which is used to make real-time conversation with consumers and it collects data from opposite such as his/ her requirement and it helps to improve the products and services.\n\n[Read More](http://www.emarketeducation.in/future-artificial-intelligence-digital-marketing/)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/9ulpkc/how_artificial_intelligence_affects_the_digital/"}, {"autor": "demianvlk", "date": "2018-10-10 02:16:38", "content": "[question] eye/chat bot /!/ Warning: wall of text\n\n\nI\u2019ve had an idea kicking around in my head for a few years and wanted some feedback before I actually start playing with it.\n\nI\u2019m an esl(English as a second language) and python (2d games) teacher at a middle school. I\u2019m also a toddler dad. This has kinda smashed together some unique observations on how language develops and how learning happens.\n\nThe project I want to start to explore these ideas(I\u2019ll list them below) is a simple eyebot(most likely a raspberry pi with a pi cam attached to a motor or two so it can look around). I\u2019ll also have an application window open with the -----> camera !!!  feed and a basic chat like interface. In addition to the chat interface there may also be a \u201cthought\u201d window (several thoughts that are not \u201cvocalized\u201d may pop up and narrate observations - a running monologue of the world around it.\n\nThe ideas I want to play with are:\n-language generation will always be hollow unless it is driven by meaning \n- embodied cognition(more so if I make this a rolling eyebot) but essentially the idea that thought and meaning generation are tied to being bound to a perspective...a body(bot should be able to derive meaning for the pronouns I,you,other from this perspective)\n- object recognition the way a toddler does it(indicate curiosity, listen to feedback, create a schema, over generalize that schema, refine the schema over time)\n- sets (everything is a thing, some things are dadda, not all things that look like dadda are called dadda- some are called momma etc) \n-\u201cis a\u201d vs \u201chas a\u201d fundamental logical distinction between nouns and adjectives \n- generative grammar (from Noam Chomsky) with an initially restricted vocab could allow the chat part of the bot create logical and grammatically correct sentences - meaning and variation could be layered on with increased objects learned through object recognition (driven by primitive shapes) and layered sets of labels/concepts I.e. sentences become more complex and accurate.\n- babies are naturally fixated by eyes and primitive shapes and pure colors in part because their eyes are not fully developed and in part because they are less overwhelming than the shifting undifferentiated mass of the rest of the vision plane, this leads to recognition of simple and easy shapes,colors, and then the brain tries to master/identify all other objects in the vision field. \n- there is an idea in Zen Buddhism that there is an initial sensory experience and then successive layers of conceptualization of that experience...leading ultimately to the narrative expression of an idea. This is what I mean about sense being tied to meaning for successful creation of language. \n\n\nA use case: the bots camera, after a significant amount of training, detects an unfamiliar object. In the application window it highlights the object with an outline, and in the chat window asks \u201cwhat is this?\u201d {knowing that \u201cthis\u201d implies proximal or indicated status} and then gets a user response - shaping its schema. In another situation it may ask \u201cwho are you?\u201d When a new user sits down- knowing the features of a human face and that this one is new...finally, when left alone the bot simply narrates the world around it as its perspective shifts \u201cthe cat is on the table again. It is next to the plant. \u201c \n\nI\u2019m not insane- I know how complex ai is and how ambitious this project is. But I\u2019m doing this for fun and to see if I can make anything kinda cool.
