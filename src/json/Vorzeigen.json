And not meaning to offend anyone on the forum... I received but sent back the next day a new M10-R in black chrome finish. This example was a disappointment after decades of use of all the M series film cameras from M3DS to MP followed by M8 and M240 of the digital series. Those performed well and looked nice too, evidencing a nice design, good machining, good finishing, and quality materials. I found the same thing with the Leitz microscopes, especially the black Ortholux. Though perhaps already discussed or deemed unimportant, what bothered me were for example the sharp corner and edges of the top plate, cheap looking hardware (buttons, wheels, locking mechanism, etc.), poor engraving, and finish that needed a good scrubbing in places to clean it up. Which begs the question, what economies were -----> introduced !!!  into the internals out of our sight? This camera was to last the rest of my life. Holding, fondling if you will, alternately the M240 with black paint finish and then the M10-R, even with closed eyes, produced an unexpected sadness. On the one hand, the touch screen, and an additional stop or two of dynamic range, and the extra pixels would all be handy though not imperative, and on the other, as an engineer the quality of materials and construction were at least as important. I have never seen an M9 or prior variants of the M10 so do not know if this is a sudden or gradual change over the last decade. Perhaps with the greatly expanded range of offerings, Leica cannot give the same attention to detail as was once customary.

In the 1960's and 1970's, for a while, my film Leicas were my main cameras, and while you'd never call me \"experienced\", I got so used to using the M2 and M3 that I didn't need to think about the camera, only about what I was photographing. Now it's all topsy-turvy, as I've been using Nikon for so long the M camera felt so strange in my hands. After ten days of using nothing but the M10, I learned zone focusing, and how to get the camera to do just what I thought I wanted. But, and this is a big \"but\", even something as simple as getting a GOOD photo of a rabbit became impossible because I couldn't get close enough. So, I did the best I could, but it meant cropping a tiny part of the image to show what I wanted. It was a very good ten days for me, as every day I went walking around hunting for something to photograph, and every night was spent with PhotoMechanic to get the image onto my laptop, and PhotoLab3 to try to get the photo to look like what my brain \"saw\". Ain't no way I'm going to get a decent photo of an alligator if another one shows up in the drainage ditch in front of my brother's property, as I know how fast they can move, and I don't want to become alligator food. I didn't/don't want to spend multiple thousands of dollars on the latest Leica telephoto lens - spending a small fraction of that on a long Leica lens (which isn't technically a telephoto) sounded better. I also want to take photos of pelicans hunting for fish, and my 50mm photos had the same problem as with my rabbit. I want to fill the frame with what I'm photographing.

I was mildly frustrated by the M8s' crop and IR problems. I like the wide-angles I paid for to be wide-angles, and I definitely noticed subjects who were - STARTLED - by the hot-pink reflections from the IR-blocking filters. Especially large ones (90mm f/2 E55) - I nearly brought a band concert to a screeching halt when the singer did a double-take. The hot-pink filters did look a little like a tactical IR rifle scope, head-on. Nevertheless the M8 produced a couple of my most memorable (and top-selling) photographs, and a C/V 15mm (effective \"20mm\") saved my bacon at the wide end. And the cropping was useful in the studio. But I did switch to the 24x36 M9 the very first week it came out - pays to be good friends with your regional Leica rep. Finally - my 21mm f/2.8 was again a 21mm f/2.8. And the M9 did -----> introduce !!!  me to the 75 focal lengths, whose close-focusing restored some of the M8's tight framing. I skipped over the M(240) variants: not enough improvement over the M9 technically; too much red; too fat; and I still hoped the \"3rd-window natural frameline illumination\" might make a comeback. I calculated the M9 should hold up for at least a decade. Added a used M9M for the ISO 10000. Then, of course, the sensor-corrosion problem came up. Fortunately, in my case, not until late 2015, and only a mild case (one hair-like track on the M9; the M9M already had a replacement sensor). A sad reflection on Leica and/or Kodak, but not a serious problem in my photography. By late 2016, I was getting ready to send in the M9 for free sensor replacement - and then the M10 was pre-announced in Jan. 2017. I downloaded some of the sample pix from dpreview.com. Shazzam! Thinner - a serious usable-ISO increase (1600 > 10000) - new Leica profile with close-to-M9 color/punch - larger and more precise RF for my 135mm f/4 and 75 f/1.4. And - at the time - actually at a lower price than my M9 had been at introduction ($6500 vs. $6950). A no-brainer change. Kept the M9 as backup until the \"last call\" for free sensor replacements, got it fixed, traded it for a second M10. I still miss the classic third-window on the front, a little.

Leica has always provided add-ons to the M system - the original Visoflex even had its own lenses. The electronic EVF is very useful when you need accurate framing (40 Summicron), for longer lenses (90mm and beyond), for lenses with no focusing flange (Zeiss 15/2.8 Distagon), adapted R lenses and for those with focus shift (35 Summilux ASPH). Also, for those whose eyesight is failing, having focus magnification is a Godsend. Interestingly, focus peaking, while a great idea, is rubbish for accuracy. I\u2019ve also found for wide angle lenses, and many others, the optical viewfinder is very accurate. But the EVF does have its uses (particularly for the M10-D). Not sure I will need to buy the new one, and I doubt it will work with existing cameras without overwhelming the processor and draining the battery - but what do I know \u2026 I agree with you 100% on the current Visoflex. When the M240 was -----> introduced !!!  with its EVF, I joked with Stefan Daniel that this was finally the \"R Solution\", after the demise of the R series. This was long before the SL was on the stage, so in a way it was the \"R Solution\". When I got my M10, I soon got the Visoflex 020. I used it primarily for table top photography or when I needed to focus and compose an R lens or Nikon lens such as my 28PC Nikkor. On my Med Cruise in 2018, I started using it with my WATE to accurately frame building interiors and exteriors. Cathedrals, etc. By the second day, I had come up with a new SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). I would focus with the OVF, and then activate Live View on the rear screen and frame the shot with it. Cut down on worrying about damaging the Visoflex (I had lost the little case for it on our second day, somewhere in Monaco). When you are with people who are not serious photographers, even though they were all friends plus my wife, you need to have an efficient run and gun technique. This worked out quite well! I agree that focus peaking is a great idea, but in reality it gets in the way of focusing accurately.

The M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is available at specialist retailers and only 450 units will be available worldwide. Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d: A homage to the great reportage photographers of our time Wetzlar, January 21, 2021. As part of the celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the Leica Oskar Barnack Award, Leica Camera AG -----> presents !!!  a special design variant of the Leica M10-P: the M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is an uncompromising reportage camera, suitable for even the most challenging conditions. Many Leica cameras throughout the company\u2019s history have been developed with the needs of press and reportage photographers in mind. This is illustrated by exceptional models such as the Leica 250 of 1933, whose film cassette accommodated 250 exposures, or the Leica MP of 1956 \u2013 a Leica M3 variant which was equipped with the Leicavit rapid winder, following the suggestions of renowned photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt (1898\u2013 1995) and David Douglas Duncan (1916\u20132018). With its dark green, particularly scratch-resistant finish and Kevlar camera trim, the Leica M10- P \u201cReporter\u201d brings to mind the extremely challenging conditions under which many of the most remarkable reportages of our time were created. Kevlar is a synthetic fibre frequently used in the production of ballistic protective clothing. Through exposure to natural UV rays, the camera\u2019s body armour will gradually turn the same colour as its top and base plate. The armour\u2019s diamond-weave texture makes the Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d especially grippy and comfortable to hold. All of the camera\u2019s engravings are inlaid in light green, resulting in a more discreet effect than the white inlays customarily used on black-finish cameras. In terms of its technical specifications, the M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is identical to the serially produced Leica M10- P. The Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is available at specialist retailers.

In theory, that spring itself can fail - but gummed-up lubricants in the mechanism are far, far more likely to cause a jam or sticking than a broken spring. ****Uh-oh!**** In examining my own M10 to confirm exactly how the lever works - I just noticed that the tip of the RF arm is catching or rubbing intermittently on the lens mount ring as the spring forces it forward. The screw and brass washer on the top of the roller-cam axle (above the arm itself) just barely clear the mount even when normal, but mine has/had even less clearance. --img--  Mostly it is just a brief contact that the spring overrides, but a couple of times it stuck hard for a moment (this would also cause the RF image to stop moving part-way through the normal range).

They arrived yesterday and I just tested. Still not good. With both cards, the initial format took a L-O-N-G time. With one card, the camera would not shoot at all. A second format allowed it to at least shoot, but then the blinking red light. With the second card, it shot on the first try, but then hung.

Supposedly the best adapter available is the Novaflex. I've also got a Nikon 50mm f/1.2 lens, but I think I read it doesn't work with this adapter for some reason. Probably not a big loss, as Ken Rockwell though it was a terrible lens. Any thoughts or advice? I know it's expensive, but last time I was searching, people told me it's \"the best\". I do work with both a Novoflex and a FotodioX adapter on a M10-R, M10-M and M10-P \"Reporter\" As for the Novoflex adapter, it is very precise, but also pretty \"stiff\". There seems to be absolutely no play between the Nikkor lens and the adapter. This is supposed to make sure that focusing remains very precise, especially with wide open glass such as the Nikkor Ai-S 50/1.2. Focusing on a RF can be utmost critical as we all know. The drawback: sometimes it es very difficult to dismount the lens from the adapter. On the other side, I can also use Nikon G lenses such as the 58/1.4G with that adapter on my M10 body, a lens that is unrivalled for its transition into soft background (\"bokeh\") I also use a FotodioX adapter, mainly for my Carl Zeiss lenses ZF.2 15/2.8 and ZF.2 135/2 (normally used on my Nikon D850). Here it is easy to mount and dismount the lens, but the link/connection is not as stiff as with the Novoflex and I am not sure, whether in critical focus situations (mainly the 135/2 wide open) I get maximum focus accuracy. For G lenses you will have to use an different FotodioX adapter. As for Ken Rockwell's opinion about lenses, I am very careful to say at least. He keeps writing his \"reviews\" long before the lenses are available. As a pro Nikon shooter I usually get the newest lens first before anyone else has a chance to get hold of it. And Ken writes \"tests\" even when lenses are officially delayed... I do love the Nikon Ai-S 50/1.2 for its nice bokeh wide open. Actually it has an equally convincing \"analog\" look as the recently re------> introduced !!!  Leica Noctilux 1.2/50mm. From f/2 onwards, the Nikkor is one of the sharpest Nikon lenses ( I own 20+ AF-S lenses and 5 Ai-S lenses, and comparing the Ai-S 50/1.2 to lenses like the PC 85/2.8, AF-S 105/1.4, AF-S 28/1.4 and the latest AF-S 120-300/2.8 amongst others drew me to that conclusion.) That's why I enjoy using this lens on the Nikon D850 or Df and on the M10-X, especially wide open, for the film look. I also love the Canon FD 1.2/55 S.S.C. Aspherical on the M10, but this is really a chunky piece of glass... FYI I own original M lenses such as the SEM 21, the FLE 35/1.4, the APO 75/2 and just recently added the 28/1.4, so I can compare my Nikon gear to Leica gear. Apart from the 50/1.2 I use Carl Zeiss lenses on the adaptors, mainly 15/2.8, 25/2 and 135/2. Hope, this was of any help to make your decision.

One of the reasons I mentioned SL2-S for your scenario is because as you are already used to very fast processing and AF with the A9 @ 24MPs, you might feel more comfortable the SL2-S than the slightly slower processing and AF of the SL2. OTOH, the SL2 is due the new AF update soon. For me personally the ideal situation is shooting both Leica M and Sony ( two very different system approaches at the top of their game IMO) and every once in a while adapting my M lenses to the 61MP Sony, just because I can!

Don't forget about Zone Focusing with the Leica M--it can be just as fast if not faster than any AF technology."}, {"autor": "KFo", "posts": "204 posts", "date": "01/30/2020 09:59  PM", "content": "9 hours ago, M10 for me said: Let me just reopen this thread. Today I had my Canon A-1 (with a 50mm lens) from the late 70ies in my hands and I realize how well all buttons and wheels are built. The focusing ring goes smooth whereas the aperture ring is quite stiff and there is no way that you can change the settings accidentally. Even the exposure compensation wheel is secured by a little button on top. Only the focus ring can be turned unintentionally which is no problem as I have to use it anyway for each shot (when not using zone focussing). With my M10 its different: The exposure rings of the lenses change their position very often unintentionally. So does the exposure compensation when the back wheel is activated for that function. As a consequence I set the back wheel to off (normally I take photographs with the OVF only). But when I want to make an exposure change (I rarely do that though) then this still works (without using the menu) by pressing this famous front-button (called focus-button) and at the same time turning the back wheel. Try it out. It is possible but very uncomfortable as its hardly not possible with one hand (you have to press that button AND turn the wheel simultaneously !!). So I understand some dissatisfaction. For users working frequently with LV or use an OVF that button is probably helpful. Wait a minute! One of the very few gripes I have about my M is that at times the Exp Comp dial gets twiddled. It does this because of a defect in my operational manner; I never turn the camera off, I always let it go to sleep and rewake it by tapping the shuttle release. As such this -----> presents !!!  the opportunity to accidentally change exp comp when I drop the camera back to my side. This takes care of that!

(Note: I\u2019m considering only still images since I don\u2019t shoot video.) In one of the SL2-S threads some people are concluding that the SL2-S is the best non-M camera for M-lenses; and better in this respect than the SL2, considering better high ISO performance and, possibly, better color. In my view, this is similar to the difference between the M10/M10-P and the M10-R. I\u2019ve had no interest in the M10-R simply because my photography, which is usually high-contrast, does not need more resolution, even for large prints. In the days of film, the forum-wallahs of the old Leica groups, said that Leica film cameras could be used for prints up to 11x14 inches and that, after that, you \u201cneeded\u201d medium format. Not me: I always liked the \u201c35mm aesthetic\u201d of Tri-X film: and was convinced of that when, around 2006, I saw a retrospective Daido Moriyama exhibition at the Gallery of New South Wales which had some 60 photos at 150x100 cm (60x40 inches) \u2014 all shot on Tri-X and printed of an Epson wide-format inkjet printer. More recently, Moriyama has been using a digital camera with a sensor the size of one's finger-nail which shoots only JPGs, the Nikon Coolpix 6500, I believe \u2014 and he still exhibits prints at the 150x100 cm, as I saw at a dazzling exhibition of his Tokyo images at the Fondation Cartier in Paris in 2015. So you see where I\u2019m coming from. I\u2019ve had no interest in the M10-R, as not only don\u2019t I need its higher resolution but also prefer the smaller files of the M10, which has better high ISO than the M10-R and doesn't need high shutter speeds for eliminating camera shake for handheld photography: @Steven has found that most of his M10-R shots at less than 1/500 sec shutter speeds exhibit camera shake. While some M10-R users state that their camera has better dynamic range than the M10, the graphs on the photonstophotos.net site don\u2019t support that, and indicate the that the M10 may even have a slight advantage in this respect: if you look at the Photo Dynamic Range Chart and, particularly, the Photo Dynamic Range Improvement chart for the M10 vs the M10-R. I shoot with an M10 and a Ricoh GR III, both 24 MP cameras. With the M10, I prefer the OVF and haven\u2019t used the Visoflex EVF that I bought with the camera. With the GRII, I shoot one-handed, and use the LCD on the back only to establish, roughly, the edges of the frame \u2014 and look directly at the subject when pressing the shutter. With both cameras, I\u2019m usually interested in the immediacy of the photography. One of the things I like about the GR III are two of its, adjustable, JPG modes: High-Contrast B&W and Positive Film. I shoot DNG + JPG, and have found, most of the time, that these JPG modes get me closer to where I want to be with the final image than working with the DNG \u2014 and much faster. With the M10, I shoot only DNGs, but feel that Leica should -----> introduce !!!  JPG modes that are as good as these two GR III ones. The other thing the GR III has is excellent IBIS. So, my three desiderata for the M10 successor are that it have (1) a 24 MP sensor, (2) good JPG modes, and (3) IBIS \u2014 although the latter may be unlikely. As the image that one can produce is the most important consideration for me, I\u2019ll conclude with three images (that I\u2019ve posted elsewhere). Two are landscapes, because this is the genre for which people generally feel they need maximum MP and the third could be called a \u201cstreet portrait\u201d. (I'm not being critical of people who want high-resolution landscapes, but am only stating what I like for my work).

IBIS would be a grateful feature for sure, but I doubt it's possible. An M camera would be bigger with this technology implement, I guess. There is no more space. And second, besides it's a great and helpful feature on many cameras, I feel that it goes against Rangefinder essence. I don't need help \ud83d\ude02 All mechanic, all natural, all raw. It feels better. It's another game if Leica makes a fusion between the M and the SL system.. So I camera like the Fujix100v ... Rangefinder look, small size, IBIS, flip screen and ....... EVF .....

Lets look at this from Leica's point of view: 1- The SL2-S is a reflection of the intense downward price pressure and competition Leica faces in the Full frame mirrorless market - both from within the L consortium and from Sony, Nikon and Canon. The M has no competition so no need for a \"budget\" version of its flagship model. 2- Good jpg modes ala Ricoh GRIII is quite possible and Leica knows IBIS would be welcomed as long as it doesn't increase the body thickness."}], "name": "Vorzeigen"}
