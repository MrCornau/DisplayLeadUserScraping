The game is simple. There are 4600+ tile NFTs on the Hexareign map, and your goal is to gain as much land as you can.\nOr not, it's up to the community to decide what winning really is.\nWhat can you do in Hexareign?\nThe game is simple by design. There is no need for complicated rules in a passive game, after all.\nEvery tile generates HEXR tokens, the game currency, as long as its level is over 0. You can forcibly colonize any non-core tile adjacent to one you own with HEXR tokens, regardless of the owner. The current owner of that tile will receive 90% of the HEXR funds used to forcibly colonize that tile.\nIf you own a tile, you can upgrade it. This costs HEXR, but will increase the amount of HEXR that the tile generates while also increasing the amount that the tile costs to be forcibly colonized.\nHarvesting the tokens on a tile that you own will put the tiles that you are owed into your wallet. Upgrading or colonizing a tile will automatically harvest the tokens.\nMultichain?\nHexareign will be added to multiple chains, but OkExChain is among the first. We want as many users to have access to the game as possible, and we think that users in crowded maps will want to play in blockchains with less players. This will ultimately help OkExChain as well as other EVMs. It's not a zero-sum game, after all!\nChallenges\nThere were some issues with getting OkExChain to work with the Unity SDK that I was using. I campaigned to make the SDK usable with as many EVMs as possible, which is why I'm able to show off this project now. Thanks to the efforts of the chainsafe team, the Unity chainsafe gaming SDK is now completely compatible with OkExChain, given someone deploys a multicall contract.\nAnother challenge was using a completely decentralized solution for hosting. As cool as it sounds, it isn't always reliable. You may find that the Hexareign website is sometimes down.\nCurrent Status & Use of Funds\nWhile I have already purchased some OKT, I found that it was a little too expensive to deploy to the Mainnet. OkExChain's gains are good for the hodlers, but not for me as a developer! I hope to gain funding so that I can take the game out of the testnet and into the OkExChain Mainnet. I estimate that it will take around 8 OKT to deploy completely, if the testnet is to be trusted.\nIf Hexareign wins a large prize from OkExChain, I will use the funds to do the following:\nPay for an audit of the smart contracts.\nDeploy to the OkExChain Mainnet.\nEmploy talented artists to beautify the world & bring the improvement update to fruition.\nLong Term Plans?\nYes, Hexareign could become a long term project, but that's really up to the degree at which we can build up a community. The improvement update is most critical, since it allows for regular content from the developers to be given to the players.\nIf desired, more complex gameplay can be added by creating new game modes, where users may not require tiles to play, and could instead take on roles such as farmers or artisans.\nWith enough blockchain integrations, even a blockchain vs blockchain DAO based Hexareign game could be made. There is no bound to creativity, only bounds to how funded and how popular the game is. We hope that OkExChain and others will support the project to ensure that this happens.\nDeployed Contracts\nHere are some of the relevant smart contracts that have been deployed on the Testnet:\nHEXR Token: 0x680794D49F13A9e84C5713ddc1326Da90c4182f1\nTile NFT: 0xd3a97C249AaDBD9cd9173414b8E321c45ad08D6c\nGame Data: 0x122202e32182291Ba3b5f56d88E3403E0AB81A93\nGame Logic: 0xAfe9828f407C759e996CdA195DB62De2de357eA0\nTile Sale: 0x81C7c3a555dc31bb4609401FEA57a927F37A271d\nToken\nI must be clear that the token is for a game, and should not be treated like an investment. Otherwise the SEC would have jurisdiction over Hexareign. That being said, I will still talk about how the token is controlled:\nThe creator account is granted 10M HEXR to be used for giveaways & funding.\nThere are 4 slots for games, each with 1B HEXR to allocate. There is a 6 month waiting period before 1B HEXR can be allocated again.\nThis is to make it so that more maps can be made on the same chain, or even potentially new game modes.\n1B HEXR is currently locked inside of the game data contract, and is where HEXR from harvesting comes from.\nWhat's next for HEXAREIGN | Low Poly NFTs\nThe next few updates will address any bugs seen. Once that has been finished, and depending on how well received the game is in these hackathons, an airdrop will be organized!\nThe next major update will also allow users to purchase improvement NFTs, that will strategically change the stats of your tiles based on their height, biome, and landforms.
