Most of the times he will be depressed which makes me feel sad and furthermore, I came to know nearly 10 million people suffer from cognitive decline and it is very hard to live their daily lives. So, I decided to help them out. Thus, I created Lantern.\n\ud83c\udf41 What it does\nLantern helps you to prevent cognitive decline with amazing features. The following features are:\n(i) Meditation: You can listen to meditation music and perform meditation. As evidence suggests that meditation may improve some aspects of cognition.\n(ii) Exercise : In our app you can able to watch simple exercise videos which make you fit physically and mentally. As engaging in a program of regular exercise improved cognitive function in people who already had memory problems.\n(iii) Sleep: Inefficient sleeping considered as a major problem of cognitive decline. So, if you can't able to sleep, you can listen to bed time stories in our app using Spotify.\n(iv) Game: We have designed a tic tac toe game. Because it helps develop coordination, fine motor skills and visual skills. It can help improve your concentration.\n(v) Diet: We suggest your healthy food to eat with the certain calories. As Mediterranean diet eating pattern has long been recognized as promoting better cardiovascular health, lowering the risk of certain cancers, and may protect against cognitive decline.\n(v) AR: We also have real time AR feature where you can experience AR at your home. You can have a fun and relaxing time with experiencing AR in real-time. It also relaxes your mind and make you active.\n(vi) Connect: It is a chat feature you can able to chat with your friends. Strong social interactions can help protect your memory and cognitive function in several ways as you age. Research shows that people with strong social ties are less likely to experience cognitive declines than those who are alone.\n(vii) To-do List: Using To-Do list makes you a super productive and organized person.\n\ud83d\udd27 How I built it\nI built this prototype with Figma, and used Canva to create slideshow. For AR I used echo-3D and linked it to figma.\n\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Challenges we ran into\nOne challenge that I ran into was managing my time while working on this project. I felt difficult while designing the tic tac toe game in figma as it should be interactive. In addition, deciding the features to include was a challenge. I had so many different ideas, and knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to implement all of them, and could only choose a few.\n\ud83d\udcab Accomplishments that we're proud of\nI\u2019m proud of how I was able to create a comprehensive prototype with decent UI/UX in such a short amount of time. In addition, since this was my first time working on a Figma project solo, it was really interesting to have full control over every aspect of the app, and I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve created!\n\u2604\ufe0f What we learned\nResearching for this project has really opened my eyes to how people suffer from cognitive decline and how important it is to work toward a solution. One of the most important things I learnt was how to work more effectively with Figma. I'm still learning how to use it because it's my first time, and every time I use it, I learn something new!

He had to get out of bed, and he couldn't go back to sleep for the next 2 hours. Our group had the genius idea to create the ALSTRETI to make sure this never happens to anyone ever again.\nWhat it does\nEssentially, our product attaches to a light switch, allowing the user to control the product using the Blynk app on their phone. The app displays the current light level in the room, and the user has the option to turn the lights on or off, just by using their phone to control the servo motor.\nHow we built it\nWe have a servo motor connected to a NodeMCU, which is powered by an external Power Module. The servo is also connected to a 3D printed attachment that mounts onto the light switch. The NodeMCU then connects to the user\u2019s phone through the Blynk app, allowing the user to seamlessly turn the lights off. If the lights are already off, that\u2019s where the photoresistor comes in. The photoresistor reads the light level of the room and based on the values taken in, the code on the NodeMCU tells the servo to either push the switch down or not move at all. The reverse case holds true as well. If the lights are off, it\u2019ll turn them on at the user\u2019s request. And if they\u2019re already on, it won\u2019t move at all.\nChallenges we ran into\nThere were a few different challenges that we ran into during the construction of the Alsreti. For example, integrating the photoresistor was a hard task, especially since it gave such inconsistent light level readings. As a result, it took quite a while to figure out the thresholds for photoresistor values, but switching from a 220ohm resistor to a 1kohm resistor helped stabilize the values, to an extent. In addition, determining the servo angle to move in the desired direction took some testing, and it took some various trials to determine how to display the light levels from the photoresistor on the Blynk dashboard, using the ArduinoIDE.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe're quite proud of 3d printing the attachment with accurate measurements, and the servo fits snugly into the part. The attachment screws into the light switch outer plating, fitting the majority of standard light switches, specifically single pole switches. Furthermore, we are quite proud of sending to the data to the Blynk app seamlessly, especially since the university wifi and NodeMCU connection can be spotty at times. Most importantly, we're proud of our final working product, worth more than money can buy.\nWhat we learned\nWe improved our solidworks skills since we had to 3d print the most important attachment for our project. We also learned about the different widgets and functions that the Blynk app offers, and we have a better understanding of how to connect the NodeMCU to the blynk app for any future projects. We also know how to send the photoresistor values to the Blynk app, which allows for endless possibilities in the future.\nWhat's next for Alstreti\nCurrently, Alstreti has plans to implement Alexa and potentially Siri into the project so that the user can simply turn the lights on or off using specific voice commands. Additionally, Alstreti plans on implementing a better photoresistor for more accurate readings so the user can rely on the product for everyday use.

In our later model, this number is an exponential decay as humidity is sapped out of the environment, this parameter is also proportional to humidity.\nHow we built it\nWe used the Gillespie algorithm to simulate the growth at each timestep given the definitions for lambda_i.\nWe used DBSCAN, an unsupervised ML algorithm to find clusters in order to find phase transitions statistics.\nWe used a Box Counting algorithm to find the fractal dimensions\nChallenges we ran into\nWe found it hard to map our lambda parameters to humidity and temperature\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nOur simple model can capture some of the key phenomenons they showed in their experiment\nWhat we learned\nWe learned that working together in an office is really fun after COVID!\nWhat's next for Frost Spreading with Cellular Automata\nPublish?", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/frost-spreading-with-cellular-automata", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost", "result": true, "Selector": "bed", "selectorShort": "bed", "MarkedSent": "inspiration\nthis project was inspired by a recent paper published on physical review e; frost spreading and pattern formation on microstructured surfaces hauer et al 2021. they grew ice crystals by varying humidity and temperature and found that interesting structures form. one of the highlights of their paper was the fractal dimension changes when humidity and temperature change. here we try to capture this phenomenon by employing a simple frost growing model.\nwhat it does\nfirst we divide up our -----> bed !!!  into grids, then our simple model takes into account 3 parameters, lambda_1 - this is the rate at which each grid point spontaneously evaporates. in our later model, this parameter is set by the amount if humidity in the air (1/lambda3)\nlambda_2 - this is the rate at which each grid point spontaneously freezes\nlambda_3 - this is the likelihood that each frozen grid point will freeze its nearest neighbours. in our later model, this number is an exponential decay as humidity is sapped out of the environment, this parameter is also proportional to humidity.\nhow we built it\nwe used the gillespie algorithm to simulate the growth at each timestep given the definitions for lambda_i.\nwe used dbscan, an unsupervised ml algorithm to find clusters in order to find phase transitions statistics.\nwe used a box counting algorithm to find the fractal dimensions\nchallenges we ran into\nwe found it hard to map our lambda parameters to humidity and temperature\naccomplishments that we're proud of\nour simple model can capture some of the key phenomenons they showed in their experiment\nwhat we learned\nwe learned that working together in an office is really fun after covid!\nwhat's next for frost spreading with cellular automata\npublish?", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": 10, "comments": 1, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 59504223}, {"Unnamed: 0": 4859, "autor": "Team 10 FlexiStand Presentation", "date": null, "content": "Inspiration\nAs regular mobile-phone users, the team felt there was a market needed for phone users while in the reclined position.

I bet you are not in one!\nWhy is it that proven sustainable betterment designs, technologies, policies, and processes, that already exist within our Texas buildings and communities, and if deployed universally would immediately solve all our equity, health, efficiency, sustainability, resilience, and productivity issues, are not being implemented? The answer is simple. The problem is complicated. Competing eco and value systems are fighting in a race to the bottom to produce minimum-code, lowest-first-cost solutions. 90% of all Texas building and community projects squeak by this non-enforced, minimum-code, lowest-first-cost threshold, and no one is held accountable for the unnecessary and avoidable social and environmental burdens that this low bar places on our communities. There is a way to standardize the evaluation of proven sustainable betterments with respect to their full social, environmental, and financial value to all stakeholders.\nLet's examine the low hanging simple practice of implementing proven better energy and water efficient designs, technologies, policies, and processes. Even with today's myopic and frenzied focus on these issues, very little progress is being made. The efforts are important because successful implementation removes the significant burden of pollution and climate impacting carbon from our communities, but does not pencil out from a business case perspective. Therefore, it is a fight to implement on every project even though higher efficiencies are easily accomplished in projects by good project teams without additional capital expenditure. This better performance threshold is not mandated and/or enforced by most Texas municipalities. The minimum-code, lowest-first-cost mentality prevails. But what if the project had to account for the cost of the pollution and carbon burdens they were throwing onto the backs of the surrounding community? What if you could calculate the dollar cost of that burden and demand that that information be made available to all stakeholders for every project? What if projects were graded on how they addressed those additional burdens. The bottom line is someone always pays, and currently it is you and me through higher healthcare costs, climate catastrophes, shorter lives, less successful lives, etc. 39% of all greenhouse gases and pollution are directly caused by the production of the materials, construction, and operations of our buildings and communities. The built environment must be a major player in creating behaviors for a better future where everyone thrives.\nThe USGBC Best Practices Committee was formed in 2019 to address the fact that almost all deployed best practice designs, technologies, polices, and processes only occur in Class A office buildings, affluent school systems, and large urban municipal buildings. None of these sustainable betterments are \u201ctrickling down\u201d to underserved communities or populations. The USGBC Texas Best Practices app was envisioned to bring equitable adoption of proven best practices to all demographics, communities and ecosystems through a common lens evaluation accessible to all stakeholders.\nWhat the US Green Building Council (USGBC) Texas Best Practices app does\nThe USGBC Texas Best Practices app gives users direct access to our USGBC Texas - Best Practice Champions, so that together they might fight and solve the social and environmental problems dumped in their laps by poor building designs, maintenance, operations, slow code adoption, and inconsistent code enforcement. USGBC Texas Best Practice Champions are USGBC Texas members who are consistently deploying above-minimum-code sustainable betterments throughout Texas. They have graciously volunteered to give of their time and talents to help other Texans emulate their superpowers.\nThe USGBC Texas Best Practices app provides dollar cost benefit outcomes of modeled better and best standards of care, wrapped around the people, profit, planet data needed to understand the magnitude impact that best practices create within our buildings and communities.\nThe USGBC Texas Best Practices app provides the business case justification for immediate deployment of voluntary above-minimum-code better and best designs, technologies, policies, and processes and provides the substantiation, professional connections and mentoring needed to ensure the places we live, learn, work, and play are healthy, safe, efficient, resilient, and prosperous.\nThe USGBC Texas Best Practices app is the onramp to understanding how standardized evaluation processes, grounded in shared defendable methodologies, can move the built environment ecosystem toward more equitable, sustainable, resilient, healthy, efficient, and prosperous outcomes. Framed in dollar cost impacts the USGBC Texas Best Practices app lays transparent the intentions and capabilities of our built environment Creators (Developers, City Planners, Code Officials, Architects, Designers, Building Owners and Operators) through preconfigured modeled analysis examples using triple bottom line (people, profit, planet) cost benefit analysis visualizations.\nThe USGBC Texas Best Practices app gives unfiltered access to the social, environmental, and financial cost benefits of deploying, and the unnecessary cost burdens of not deploying, known best practices to both building and community Creators and Inhabitants (Tenant Businesses, School Teachers, Students, Employees, you, and me). This information has been traditionally difficult to obtain in an economical and decision ready timely manner. When this information has been available, it has never been made transparent to building or community Inhabitants. This life and business altering data can now be used by motivated Creators who want to, and know how to, create a better built environment. This data is also now available directly to building and community Inhabitants such that they can hold Creators accountable for not fulfilling their ethical obligations of protecting our health and wellbeing (AIA Ethics Code E.S. 2.4 Environmental Equity and Justice: Members should promote fairness and safety in providing professional services and make reasonable efforts to advise their clients and employers of their obligations to the environment, including: access to clean air, water, sunlight and energy for all; sustainable production, extraction, transportation and consumption practices; a built environment that equitably supports human health and well-being and is resistant to climate change; and restoring degraded or depleted natural resources.)\nThe USGBC Texas Best Practices app creates an organic growth income opportunity for USGBC Texas in support of its mission, \"The U.S. Green Building Council Texas is a community-benefit (501c3) nonprofit committed to ensuring a better built environment for current and future generations of Texans. We are uniquely focused on uniting all stakeholders involved in the development, design, construction, operation and use of the built infrastructure to achieve equitable practices and policies that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable.\" The app encourages USGBC membership, in app advertisement, collaboration, partnership, education, and advocacy.\nHow we built it\nThis USGBC Texas Best Practices app was created using modeled triple bottom line cost benefit outcomes of above-minimum-code better and best practices in both a typical Houston middle school and a typical Houston 10-story office building. McMac Cx (www.mcmaccx.com), a Houston Texas social enterprise funded and provided their advanced analytics \"Impact Advocacy Tech\" modeling to populate the app with appropriate data. An app developer was hired to create the initial android interface. The app's current configuration is modeling six (6) \"Best Practices\"\nEnergy Efficiency,\nWater Efficiency,\nOutside Air Ventilation,\nFiltration,\nHVAC Controllability, and\nDaylighting Access\nDigging deeper into the app allows the user to connect directly to USGBC Texas Best Practice Champions (free for USGBC Members, Texas school systems, and community facing organizations and non-profits).\nLinked in-app narrated PowerPoint presentations are currently in production that allow app users to understand what better and best practices are, and how the triple bottom line cost benefit analysis methodologies are used to model social, environmental, and financial outcome benefits.\nThe following best practices are ready to be rolled out to the app:\nESG Implementation\nEmbedded Carbon\nOperational Carbon\nLighting Controllability\nView Access\nMaintenance\nRenewable Energy\nGreen Roof\nPervious Surfaces\nUnmanaged Turf\nTrees & Shrubs\nOnsite Natural Retention\nRecreation Opportunity\nEducational Opportunity\nBiodiversity\nCommunity Connection\nPollination\nSustainability Financing\nChallenges we ran into\nTime, money, and defendable data were the biggest challenges. McMac Cx provided funding, like kind services, and modeled data using recognized global methodologies that allowed an app developer to finish Phase 1 of the app.\nAn unexpected challenge is that motivated building and community creators are hesitant to communicate this revelatory information to their clients. Although the app models a static school and office building's outcomes, architects have been fearful to move forward with the data on existing projects, as it exposes the lack of insight used to make previous decisions. In consultation with leading sustainably focused Creators we are helping them relate these static model results and inject the information at the right time in a project's trajectory and in a manner that does not embarrass them with their traditional clients. By arming them with the data and grounded justification, Creators can differentiate themselves in the marketplace and accomplish what they have been training to create professionally and wanting to create personally. If custom project specific triple bottom line cost benefit modeling and analysis is required users of the app can directly access the list of Best Practices Champions, evaluate their capabilities, and choose a professional that provides those specific services.\nBuilding owners have been slow in figuring out how to sell the better or best practice outcomes in their projects because most of the additional benefit outcomes of better and best practices go directly to the Inhabitant (Social) or community (Environment), and not directly into the building owner's pockets as cash (lowest-first-cost, minimum-code mentality). Building owner's typically only go above this low self-interest threshold if Inhabitants demand it. The USGBC Texas Best Practices app is educating Inhabitants and they are beginning to understand how little their health, wellbeing, and prosperity have been considered in the past. They will be demanding more from their building and community Creators. As an organization USGBC Texas continues to work with all stakeholders to educate and create behavior change within building owner and municipal planner organizations.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe have been very surprised and gratefully for how many USGBC Texas Members have stepped up and volunteered to become Best Practice Champions. The USGBC Texas Best Practices app has acted as a catalyst for Best Practice Champions to engage locally, bridging the gap between their professional skills and their altruistic passions. Few Creators get out of bed every day looking forward to designing, building, or operating lowest-first-cost, minimum code projects.\nThe creation of the USGBC Texas Best Practices Committee, identifying professionals as USGBC Texas Best Practice Champions, and now the launch of the USGBC Texas Best Practices app has given our members and our collaborative partners a clear opportunity and pathway to connect their professional capabilities with their altruistic passions. Too often building and community Creators are unable to connect their passions to their professions in current employment. One of the requirements to become a USGBC Texas Best Practices Champion is the identification, commitment, and direct connection, either through monetary donations, like-kind professional services, and/or hands on volunteer work, with a local community facing non-profit or other organizations that are attempting to solve the burdens previous Creators have placed on their shoulders. This has created many meaningful and constructive connections and conversations. It has elevated new and existing connections by creating a structured communication conduit through the USGBC Texas Best Practices app for behavior change.\nWhat we learned\nWe have created an accessible first-of-its-kind tool that makes transparent the direct connection between Creator\u2019s behaviors with respect to deployment or non-deployment of best practice's impacts on social, environmental, and financial cost benefit outcomes. However, we have a long way to go to see these types of sustainable betterments become common place in our buildings and communities.\nTo make adoption of these best practices a common reality USGBC Texas has created a strategic plan to make it happen. In broad strokes we will simultaneously advance implementation of best practices through our Best Practice Champions, the Best Practices app, and continued connections to the community through education, advocacy, and outreach.\nWhat's next for USGBC Texas Best Practices App\nHere is our plan moving forward:\nContinue to create content (In-app narrated PowerPoint videos, additional best practice releases, more advertisements).\nRoll out i-Phone and Windows versions of the app. We are currently soliciting grants and donation monies needed to finance the conversion of the app to these additional platforms ($50,000).\nRoll out our Best Practices social media campaign. We are about to launch a consistent weekly social media campaign that will spotlight one (1) Better / Best Practice currently accessible in the app, highlight one Best Practice video, highlight a Best Practice Champion\u2019s superpower and their commitment to USGBC Texas members, schools systems, and community facing organizations, highlight a connected community facing organization\u2019s mission and how USGBC Texas can/is helping, teaser for Better / Best Practices slated to be added to the app, member surveys, Best Practices newsletter, advertiser spotlight, etc. McMac Cx has committed to fund one (1) intern per semester to assist in this effort.\nProfessional video and newsletter production. The goal is to make this app universally accessible and applicable for anyone. The app is currently free to use. Membership in USGBC Texas ($69.00/year) is required to access the Best Practice Champions (Schools Systems and Community facing organizations have free access).

"Inspiration\nFor the last few years, I\u2019ve had back problems, most likely caused by poor posture when using the computer.\nA few weeks ago, I had a back spasm, and for a few days, I was unable to move most of my body without sharp pain in my back. Using the computer was painful, but I still needed to get work done, especially during midterm season. Both sitting in a chair and slouching in bed cause me to crane my neck, which is not good for my posture.\nAs I was lying there in pain, I wished I had a way to just have the computer screen right above my face, while keeping the keyboard on my lap, so I could keep my spine fully straight when using the computer. I knew I could do this with a VR headset like the Oculus Rift, but those are expensive \u2014 around $400.\nBut what if I could use my phone as the VR headset? Since I already own it, the only cost is the VR headset holder. Google Cardboard costs around $5, and a more comfortable one that I purchased off Amazon was only $20. Simply slide the phone in, and you\u2019re ready to display content.\nI tried searching for an app that would allow me to mirror my screen in a stereoscopic view on my phone, but I couldn\u2019t find one in existence. So I made one!\nWhat it does\nFirst, launch the app on your computer. It waits for the companion app to be launched on a phone connected by USB. Once it\u2019s connected, you can start streaming your desktop to your phone, and there is a stereoscopic view displayed on the companion app. Although it looks small, modern phones are pretty high-resolution, so it\u2019s really easy to read the text on the screen. Now simply slide it into the holder and put it on your head. It's just like an extra monitor, but you get a full view and you can look in any direction without hurting your neck!\nHow we built it\nThere were a lot of technical challenges implementing this. In order to have a low latency stream to the phone, I had to do a wired connection over USB, but Apple doesn\u2019t support this natively. I used an external framework called PeerTalk, but they only allow raw TCP packets to be sent over the USB from the computer to the phone, so I had to serialize each frame, de-serialize it on the phone, and then display it stereoscopically, all in real-time.\nChallenges we ran into\nI had a lot of trouble with Objective-C memory safety, especially during deserialization when the data was received by the phone. I was obtaining the data on the phone but was unable to turn it into an actual image for around 24 hours due to numerous bugs. Shoutout to Bhushan, a mentor who helped me debug some annoying memory issues!\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nI'm super proud that it actually works! In fact, I made one of the final commits using the headset instead of my actual computer screen. It's practical and it works well!\nWhat we learned\nLearned a ton about graphics serialization and Objective-C memory safety.\nWhat's next for LaptopVR\nI want to add the optional ability to track movements using the gyroscope, so you can have a slightly more zoomed-in version of the screen, and look up/down/left/right to see the extremes of the screen.

Our solution will notify parents their baby is currently crawling out of the crib so that they can save the day.\nWhat it does\nBabii is a system designed to allow parents to detect when their baby is crawling out of its crib. Parents often fear that their baby is going to crawl out, fall, and hurt themself. To help with this struggle, our team created a camera that mounts to the crib and detects if the baby is trying to crawl out. If the server detects that the baby might be in danger of crawling out, it'll immediately text and notify the parents, so they can stop their baby before anything bad happens. There's also an online portal so parents can watch their baby in real time.\nHow we built it\nBabii.space was built using a Python Flask server with Socket.io to handle web sockets. OpenCV was utilized for image processing. On the front end, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind.css were used. The Raspberry Pi's end was a mixture of hardware and software. The Raspberry Pi Zero W was equipped with a PiCam, and a python script written to take a picture and send it through requests.post to the server. A box was then modeled using Fusion 360 and 3D-printed, after measuring the dimensions of the pi and the picam. The box has holes to be mounted on the bar of a crib for easy usage. The website is hosted on Replit.\nChallenges we ran into\nThere were a number of challenges our team ran into.\nAt the start of creating the project, part of the CAD model for the enclosure was askew, which presented issues and resulted in part of the model being redone.\nWith the Raspberry Pi, there was some trouble with the wifi. The DukeOpen wifi performs authentication that the Raspberry Pi doesn't pass, so a lot of time was spent debugging until we found that the DukeVisitor wifi alleviated our problems there. SSH was also laggy, making development slower.\nWhen we set up baby detection, we used opencv to detect the baby. However, Replit couldn't import opencv due to issues with the poetry lock file and module version conflicts. Our team thought we might have to move away from Replit altogether. Thankfully, this issue was solved by using the shell instead of clicking the run button. Also relating to opencv, the server utilized upper and lower bounds to detect the orange of the pumpkin (the baby). Using a stock orange filter, the pumpkin wasn't detected. We had to narrow down the color of the pumpkin to get this to work.\nOn the front end, using flex-grow and then h-full (setting the image to full height) caused the images to extend beyond the bottom bounds of the body. This was solved by explicitly defining the height of the bounding div.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nAs a team, we're proud about every aspect of this project. We're proud that the cad model has the correct dimensions and is a compact product. We are also proud that it is baby safe because there are no exposed electronics. We are proud that we can detect the pumpkin(child) and get real-time texting alerts about its location. We are also proud of the UI on our website because it is friendly for new parents and easily usable.\nWhat we learned\nWe learned lot through this - how to share files and work with multiple people on Fusion 360, how to send files through post requests on the Raspberry Pi, how to receive files and process them using Flask and OpenCV, how to use Twilio and send photos, and that the DukeOpen wifi should not be used with Raspberry Pi's.\nWhat's next for Babii\nBabii could be improved by using machine learning with computer vision to detect the baby. Right now it detects the color orange, but in the future this can be made more precise. It can also be improved by using an infrared camera, making it much more applicable during the nighttime.

I admired the way the conductor was able to use a hand and baton to drive action from all of those musicians with just simple passionate gestures. That night I went to bed, setting my Google Home alarm, only for it to go off in the middle of the night when my voice was too tired and scratchy to effectively tell it to stop. I thought back to the symphony and laid there wishing I could have signaled a \u201crest\u201d or off motion with my hands instead of using it to take a sip of water so I could clear my throat and my assistant could understand me. Though there is a physical touch shortcut, the next day I wondered what would it be like to use an assistant if I wasn't someone who spoke verbally, especially using my phone? I thought of just using the typing commands, but then I wondered why people who spoke verbally had more options for communication than those who did not. I brushed the idea off until the night before HackDuke when I went to see \u201cDune\u201d in theaters. In the film, (semi-spoiler alert but not really) one of the characters uses a singular hand to communicate non-verbal, discrete messages of danger and alert guards on multiple occasions. So, I then (as I was building our team) connected using singular hand gestures to having powerful outcomes and saving a life, which happen to be the two things technology is very good at, to recognizing the powerful element in being able to use technology privately and faster than typing speed.\nWhat it does\nASL to Action is an application that utilizes sign language to simplify the fundamental daily action of communicating with our mobile devices. By integrating a language that speaks through silence in an online space, we bridged the gap between virtual thought and human movements. There\u2019s now more to how we can control our devices to search and text our thoughts by letting our hands speak for us.\nHow we built it\nWe built this using Google's Teachable Machine and Wix. The sign detection and recognition was generated using Google\u2019s Teachable Machine tool. A virtual model was trained for Tensorflow and JavaScript with a team generated dataset, and then uploaded to a demo site hosted by Google.

What really keeps us going is a belief that one day we will make the notion of \"hospitals at your fingertips\" true.\nWhat it does\nSwasthify aims at mitigating the hardships people faced during this pandemic. We provide an interactive user interface where a user can directly interact with respective hospitals that are self-registered on our application. Users will get to access a spate of services that these hospitals provide. Hospitals can easily update the availability of these services by logging in to their dashboard. The services range from ICU beds availability to the number of vaccines that the hospitals have. Users can easily browse for these services in different cities and hospitals and then book them from the hospital of their choice. This application will also provide its users a prescription section where all the previous prescriptions of the users will be available for future reference.\nHow we built it\nWe have used the following Tech-Stack to build our application:\nFrontend : Angular, Typescript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap\nBackend: Spring boot, Java\nCloud Service Providers: Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean\nDatabase: Azure MySQL\nHosting Service Provider: Netlify\nChallenges we ran into\nThere were a number of cumbersome challenges that we encountered during building this application. A few of them were: 1) As we used Azure app-service to deploy the backend of our application and Azure MySQL for the database. So while deployment the Maven build for the Spring Boot application was failing due to some unsolicited errors. It took us a great deal of time to figure out the reason for the Build failure. The build failure was primarily due to the limited access of the Azure MySQL database whose configurations were mentioned in the application, Property file of our application. When this access issue was resolved, then build failures were encountered which were due to some wrong configurations in the deploy.yml file, which upon recreation got resolved. 2) We created a service to introduce light and dark visibility modes for different components/pages of our application. Since these components are loosely coupled so we subscribed to the value for light and dark mode from this service, but the nav-bar and self-analysis components were facing some subscription errors which were later resolved by changing the invoking pattern of the function for this service, with some finesse which was required in the .SCSS file. 3) The next challenge was related to capital investment. As we are using Netlify and Azure for deployment purposes, but both of these services provide a limited number of credits, and that too for a stipulated period of time.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n1) We are able to provide hospitals and interface forms where they can manage all the services they provide 2) Patients/users are able to filter out the hospitals on the basis of city and services. This will enable them to priorly decide their destination hospital at the time of despair. 3) Our application is extremely responsive and user-friendly thus even the most naive and amateurish person can operate it.\nWhat we learned\nThe application is a stark example of a full-stack project. So we are able to get good hands-on Angular and Spring Boot. It also provided us the innovativeness to think of a highly user-friendly UI. We got a tactile interaction with Azure services which we utilized for deployment purposes.
