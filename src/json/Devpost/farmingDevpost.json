It includes your state of minds also, as well as occasionally your lucky number, or what not to do for the day to stay clear of problem or misfortune. That is why lots of people check their individual horoscopes everyday to find out what is their future for the day or for the entire week. The horoscopes are usually published in newspapers, magazines, and books. Yet what truly are horoscopes and also when did it start? Who started it? Well, allow us try to find out about the history of horoscopes.\nAllow us try to recognize the background of the astrology horoscope. The old Greeks used horoscope and also astrology forecasted as well as pre-determined the person's life by the position of the moon, sunlight, and stars. Astrology is the Greek name which means \"scientific research of the stars\". They believed that the individual's life and the future events that might occur to them would certainly rely on the position of the suns or worlds. Likewise, the farmers prior to depended on the settings of the constellations. During that time, the planters used the signs of the celebrities to identify the effective means to know when to plant and when to gather their crops.\nThroughout that time, there was no formal education and learning to offer reputable details. Individuals looked in the direction of the stars overhead to locate the solution to some continuous questions concerning their proceeded existence. In fact, we still do that today when we confront with problems and also can not discover services. Some believers most likely to the astrologers to know their solutions of the trouble or many company men would certainly ask their future in business. It was the china that began the study and also use of astrology for farming as well as to choose of ideal seasons and months for different growing cycles.\nIn 500 BC, Plato, the thinker, got interested as well as examined better concerning the astrology and also used it. Because of the study of Plato of the astrology, the rate of interest of astrology kept alive. His jobs was continued by Galileo Galilei who was the first individual to use the telescope. After that the Christians had a powerful voice that the method of astrology had actually silently concealed. To avoid the rage of the Church and to make it more acceptable in 1600 an astrologist William Lilly renamed astrology \"Christian Astrology\". Clancy released his own publication which was called \"American Astrology.\" It was instrumental in promoting astrology horoscopes as we understand them today.\nAside from the Greek, the Chinese likewise had their very own horoscope technique, yet they used various methods, if Greece used the constellation, the Chinese pre-owned pets' signs which are the rats, ox tiger, fish, dragon, dogs, rabbit and others. The used of the pets will rely on your data birth date. A horoscope is a graph or a diagram of the zodiac signs that depict the elements of the stars and planets at a given minute as well as anticipated the future not the person, however also of a geographic area or even the world.\nOver the background, the astrology horoscopes had been used to establish if there will certainly be upcoming battles. Miss Nancy Reagan worked with an astrologer to shield Head of state Reagan considering that there had been an effort to assassinate him. The astrologer determined the right times for him to sign essential records, the correct time to visit places, the correct time to hold seminars and also meeting. Well without a doubt, we can say they were accurate forecasts because President Reagan survived until he completed his 2 called as Head of state of U.S.A..

This could be easily seen as the amount of migrant labours returning back to their villages was very high.\nThis product mainly focus on making farmers self reliant and increasing average crop production per hectare thus making not only them but also India ecnomically stronger. It would not only provide employment to these migrant labours but would also reduce the trade deficit with other countries in terms of food items by increasing export and reducing imports.\nAfter shocks are lot more fatal then the Earthquake itself so we have to prepare accordingly for the after effects of covid19 and this could be done by increasing economic conditions as well as providing employment to MSME.\nWhat it does\nAn effective, efficient & feasible way of soil testing to promote modern agriculture and to also reduce it's ill health effects like bio-magnification and eutrophication.\nConventional soil testing laboratories take around \u20b950-\u20b9600 to get the soil tested whereas through this device it would be done in just \u20b913.\nFor conventional soil testing in laboratories it takes around 2weeks to even 2 months to get the soil tested as the sample is first sent to the laboratories which are mostly situated in the major cities and then after the test the farmer gets back the result. Whereas through this device it can be done instantly.\nThis device provides easy to understand reports which even the farmers can interpret without any difficulties making them self reliable. Whereas conventional soil testing provides detailed report which an illiterate (in terms of formal education) can't understand.\nThis device provides localized reports depending upon weather conditions and topographical data making the report more accurate. For Ex- The soil of UNNAO, a district in UP, India is quite rich in Sulphur which is quite unnatural so it would cause errors in the conventional way of soil testing.\nThe device also provides weather precautions which could be of great help for farmers. If the farmers of Maharashtra would have got timely precautions about the pre mature rainfall then they would not have suffered such a big loss of onion crop and its price would have not hiked in India.\nThe device not only predicts the soil content but can also predict the most suitable crop along with type and amount of fertilizer required. It would also suggest precautions about weather conditions if any. The farmers have soil testing card which has details regarding the pincode and the area of their farm, so these data along with the NPK values helps in these predictions.\nHow we built it\nThe device works on RGB analysis and is built using In depth interfacing TCS3200 colour sensor, At-Mega microcontroller, HC06 Bluetooth transmitter, Chromatographic chemical strip, liquid crystal display, some minor electronic parts, pcb board and python script for data analysis.\nThe farmers would just have to dip the given strip in the aqueous solution of their soil, stick it on the soil health card and scan it through the device. The soil health card would contain a barcode which would be unique for each farmer, having details like location, size and previous record of tests (if any). All these details along with the stored dataset would help in predicting the most suitable crop, soil NPK content, along with type and amount of fertilizers required depending upon all of the aforesaid factors.\nAll the details would be printed on the soil health card in the local language. This scanning device which cost around \u20b9400 could be installed in post offices of every village and in future it would be replaced by a smartphone application. Through the smartphone application, farmers could do the soil testing and prediction through just a click of their smartphones.\nChallenges we ran into\nIncreasing accuracy of the prediction was one of the most challenging hurdle that I faced during the development of this project which was further solved by modifying the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithm as per the need of the project. The second challenge was that the conventional soil tests are based on tilled systems was used from the 1940's through the 1960's, so they often fall short in providing estimates in cover-crop & no-till systems, which create entirely different soil profiles. This device solves this problem by doing testing by following RGB analysis on chromatographic strip. Soil content are affected by alot of artificial factors for example, because of the recent installation of nuclear power plant in Bhatinda, Punjab, soil content has changed drastically. Because of this wheat and rice aren't the most appropriate crops now. But since the farmer's father and grand-father used to grow it and as it's also grown in the rest of Punjab, the farmers of Bhatinda still grow it but get very low average production per hectare as soil content is affected alot by the installation of the nuclear power plant. This device solves this problem by incorporating localized report and topographical data along with the NPK values to predict the most appropriate crop depending upon all the factors.\nWhat's next for Tech-Agro\nTo develop an app for soil testing, thus replacing the existing device Just click a snap of the strip and the test is done, real time reports on your smartphones along with precautions and steps for better yield. UI would be in local language for better understanding. Respond to developing risks with advanced warnings and decision insights. Improve field operations with strategic information from satellites, sensors, and markets.

On Thanksgiving, we eat a large dinner and give thanks to our family and friends. However, we often do not thank the people that grew the food. This application, which provides anyone who wishes to grow crops the ideal crops for their environmental and soil conditions and the conditions in which crops are grown, was developed to give thanks to the farming community and to encourage growing crops.\nWhat it does\nMenu When the user runs the program, they are presented with a menu. The user can choose to either select the option for finding the best correct crops for their soil and environment or choose to view graphs for the environmental conditions for various crops.\nFind the perfect crops for your conditions If the user clicks on this button, a classification neural network model, MLPClassifier, is trained using Crop_recommendations.csv. Then, the user can enter the various soil and environmental conditions. After the user clicks submit, they are presented with the three most suitable crops for their soil and environment.\nView the conditions in which crops are grown If the user clicks on this button, they are presented with a screen in which they can select the condition (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, temperature, humidity, pH, or rainfall) which they want to observe. After the selection is made, the user is presented with a plot that displays the crops (y-axis) versus condition with the respective unit (x-axis). This allows the user to identify the various ranges in which the various crops can grow. The data is drawn from Crop_recommendations.csv.\nHow we built it\nThe program is built on repl.it IDE in the Python language.\nUI The UI was built using the PySimpleGUI package.\nCrop recommendations The top three crop recommendations are made using the MLPClassifier classification model. The neural network model is trained using Crop_recommendations.csv, with all condition columns (all columns except the last) as the x_fit and the labels column (the column with the crop names) as the y-fit. The model is trained on real-world crop data collected by Atharva Ingle on Kaggle. The top three recommendations are made by utilizing the probability feature of the model. The probabilities of various classifications are calculated. The three labels with the highest probability are outputted for the user to see.\nConditions Graph The graph is plotted using seaborn's catplot and matplotlib. The graph utilizes the user's condition selection from the dropdown menu as the column from Crop_recommendations.csv that should be read for the values of the various crops. Each row is plotted on the catplot, creating a range in which the different crops are grown. For example, if the user selects temperature, the ranges in which the various crops are grown are visually provided to the user.\nChallenges we ran into\nThis is the first time that I used pysimpleGUI.

Crypto has changed this forever \u2014 currently, all major cryptocurrency exchanges offer margin trading accounts. On centralized stock and cryptocurrency exchanges traders borrow addition capital from brokers and exchange operators who decide on lending rates, fees and procedures for liquidating risky leveraged positions. However, on centralized trading platforms their operators have full control over leveraged trading rules, including decisions on capital lending rates, assets, available for leveraged trading, and liquidation procedures.\nWOWswap democratizes leveraged trading further by giving all power to the community. With WOW protocol liquidity providers can create and operate common liquidity pools, and traders can borrow these funds for their leveraged trades according to the rules collectively established by WOW token holders.\nIn decentralized finance (DeFi) leveraged trading also should be decentralized: community needs to be able to create and operate common liquidity pools and decide on leverage trading rules. WOWswap is a community-run protocol for leveraged trading on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Using WOWswap\u2019s smart-contracts individual liquidity providers operate common liquidity pools, and traders use these funds to finance their leveraged trades on decentralized AMMs such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap.\nAll critical protocol\u2019s parameters such as tokens approved for leveraged trading, liquidation margins, insurance fees, liquidation rewards, lending rates, fees for traders and liquidity providers are collectively decided by holders of WOW token \u2013 the protocol\u2019s governance token.\nWhat it does\nOn Okex Chain WOWswap works on top of CherrySwap DEX. Using WOWswap\u2019s smart-contracts individual liquidity providers create and operate common liquidity pools, and traders borrow these funds to finance their leveraged trades on CherrySwap DEX.\nIf the price of the token that a trader buys goes up, the trader receives a multiplied profit. However, if the price of the token goes down the trader suffers a multiplied loss. When a trader closes a leveraged trading position, the liquidity pool receives back the borrowed funds plus the accrued interest.\nIf the token price goes below the liquidation threshold, then anyone can become a margin caller by triggering the liquidation of the trader's position. In this case the trader will lose all capital invested in the trade, and the margin caller gets the rest of the funds as a reward.\nWOWswap allows to borrow additional capital in $OKB and $USDT to buy other tokens with leverage. At launch over 5+ tokens are supported.\nHow we built it\nFirst, we started with a vision to build a decentralized, permissionless, and user-friendly platform that will be as simple as Uniswap but will have additional features such as leverage, short-selling, and limit-orders. We also wanted to create a community-governed protocol, so that all protocol\u2019s parameters can be set by users rather than some central authority.\nSecond, back in January 2021 we build a simple landing page explaining our vision and roadmap. As soon as we published it and shared with some friends and colleagues, our community started to grow very quickly as it turned out our product was needed by many people. A week later we completed our token sale (closing the hard cap in 9 seconds) and secured necessary funding for building the product.\nThird, we found and onboarded top-class engineers. Our technical team consists of highly skilled professionals who are very passionate about writing elegant, clean and efficient code. In the past, they won numerous hackathons and have many years of experience with solidity, rust, and different blockchains.\nForth, on our main page we published a countdown \u2013 45 days from toke sale to production. Those 1.5 months we worked 12-18 hours every day, mostly without weekends. And we kept the promise to our token holders by launching the product on the declared date \u2013 the 12th of April 2021.\nFifth, over the last 8 months we were making improvements, fixing bugs, and adding numerous features. It\u2019s faire to say that we rebuilt the protocol completely since the first launch. We expanded the protocol to 8 chains and listed over 100 tokens for leveraged trading. From the business perspective, we significantly expanded our team, and formed many great partnerships with other projects, DEXes, marketing companies, investors and influencers. Currently, our product is very strong, battle-tested, and ready for mass adoption.\nChallenges we ran into\nBuilding a protocol from scratch was a challenge because we had to create a totally new product, inventing algorithms, and math behind them. For example, most leveraged trading platforms require users to deposit some collateral before making the trade. In WOWswap, no collateral is required because WOWswap automatically turns purchased tokens into the collateral.\nCreating our own protection against flash loan attacks. Many DeFi protocols were victims of flash loan attacks, therefore most leveraged trading platforms use chainlink oracle price feeds. The downside of this approach is that Chainlink provides price feeds only for major tokens that can be traded with leverage on many centralized exchanges. Creating our own protection against flashloan attacks was a technical challenge but it allowed us to list many tokens for leveraged trading.\nExpanding and maintaining the protocol on 8 chains. When we initially built WOWswap on BSC we did not expect it to become a truly multichain project. On BSC WOWswap has over 150 smart contracts, integrates with Pancakeswap DEX, and has onchain DAO with staking rewards. Now, imagine expand this to other 7 chains, making integrations with 7 other customized AMMs, making price feed bots and liquidation bots for other 7 chains, bridging $WOW tokens to other chains and making 7 other DAOs, etc.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWOWswap has been running on EVM compatible blockchains since April 12, 2021. Since then we have succeeded in the following areas:\nRanked #1 platform by the number of supported assets (over 100 tokens across 7 chains) Integrated into the UI of Pangolin DEX (Avalanche) and Mimo DEX (IoTex) Fully audited by Hacken, running 6 months without incidents TVL > $2,000,000 Integrated with Pancakeswap, Quickswap, Pangolin, Sushiswap, Mimo, Mdex, Serum In DeFi we are proud of the following achievements:\nLaunched on 6 EVM compatible blockchains. No collateral deposit is required before opening a trading position Leveraged trading for fractionalized NFTs All protocol\u2019s parameters can be changed instantly via on-chain governance First onchain referral program with referral payouts paid by a smart contract\nWhat's next for WOWswap\n1 Launching Limit Order\nLimits orders include Stop Loss and Take Profit. This will enable users to open a position with an exit strategy planned ahead. By enabling take profit, WOWswap also adds a unique feature to CherrySwap users because WOWswap also allows to trade tokens without leverage, so users can take profit when it reaches the predetermined percentage.\n2 Launching WOWswap Pro\nWowswap interface is minimalistic and is extremely easy to use. In fact, opening leveraged short or long position takes just 1-click. Yet we recognize the demand for more professional trading experience to maximize those gains, therefore, we will soon launch WOWswap PRO to include more trading data, always-on chart and possibility to open a position and follow the portfolio in one page.\n3 Analytics page release\nFor all the data freaks, statistics page will display TVL, trading volume, total fees collected, interest rate changes as well as liquidation volume and trading volume changed per token.\n4 Efficient capital utilization \u2014 launching WOWswap Yield Aggregator\nAt the time of writing, APY on BNB and BUSD is 26% and 46%, respectively with only 17%+ percent of the pool utilization ratio. It means that more than 3/4s of the pooled assets are sitting idle.\nTo increase pool utilization efficiency we will launch WOWswap yield aggregator to farm rewards from other protocols. Adding a yield farming strategy could generate extra 10% to 15% extra APY to WOWswap liquidity providers. In the future, the same technology could be applied for proxy-tokens, which are pegged 1:1 to the underlying tokens and are held by WOW\u2019s smart-contract on your behalf.\n5 Enable WOW burn and reward distribution\nEvery time a trade makes a profit on a leveraged position, WOWswap protocol charges a fee of net profit made by traders, which is adjusted by the governance. Currently the fee goes to WOWswap treasury, but very soon we will start to burn WOW tokens and distribute the rest of the protocol\u2019s revenue to xWOW holders.\n6 Launch Phase 2 of WOWswap governance \u2014 WOWswap Improvement Proposals\nWOWswap On-chain Instant governance is live on selected blockchains, but some changes to the protocol require manual interference. Therefore, in the next phase WOWswap Improvement Proposals (WIP) portal will be launched where xWOW holders will be able to propose new tokens for listings, adding new features to the protocol, propose/vote on adding new charities for donations and more.\n7 UI/UX Optimization\nEven though the user interface on WOWswap is simple and is easy to use, there are a lot of moving parts under the hood that need to be improved, optimized and polished to make the experience as flawless as it can be. In the next few months we will focus on improving the UI experience, especially, for mobile users.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/wowswap-q0sjku", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost",

crypto has changed this forever \u2014 currently, all major cryptocurrency exchanges offer margin trading accounts. on centralized stock and cryptocurrency exchanges traders borrow addition capital from brokers and exchange operators who decide on lending rates, fees and procedures for liquidating risky leveraged positions. however, on centralized trading platforms their operators have full control over leveraged trading rules, including decisions on capital lending rates, assets, available for leveraged trading, and liquidation procedures.\nwowswap democratizes leveraged trading further by giving all power to the community. with wow protocol liquidity providers can create and operate common liquidity pools, and traders can borrow these funds for their leveraged trades according to the rules collectively established by wow token holders.\nin decentralized finance (defi) leveraged trading also should be decentralized: community needs to be able to create and operate common liquidity pools and decide on leverage trading rules. wowswap is a community-run protocol for leveraged trading on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. using wowswap\u2019s smart-contracts individual liquidity providers operate common liquidity pools, and traders use these funds to finance their leveraged trades on decentralized amms such as uniswap and pancakeswap.\nall critical protocol\u2019s parameters such as tokens approved for leveraged trading, liquidation margins, insurance fees, liquidation rewards, lending rates, fees for traders and liquidity providers are collectively decided by holders of wow token \u2013 the protocol\u2019s governance token.\nwhat it does\non okex chain wowswap works on top of cherryswap dex. using wowswap\u2019s smart-contracts individual liquidity providers create and operate common liquidity pools, and traders borrow these funds to finance their leveraged trades on cherryswap dex.\nif the price of the token that a trader buys goes up, the trader receives a multiplied profit. however, if the price of the token goes down the trader suffers a multiplied loss. when a trader closes a leveraged trading position, the liquidity pool receives back the borrowed funds plus the accrued interest.\nif the token price goes below the liquidation threshold, then anyone can become a margin caller by triggering the liquidation of the trader's position. in this case the trader will lose all capital invested in the trade, and the margin caller gets the rest of the funds as a reward.\nwowswap allows to borrow additional capital in $okb and $usdt to buy other tokens with leverage. at launch over 5+ tokens are supported.\nhow we built it\nfirst, we started with a vision to build a decentralized, permissionless, and user-friendly platform that will be as simple as uniswap but will have additional features such as leverage, short-selling, and limit-orders. we also wanted to create a community-governed protocol, so that all protocol\u2019s parameters can be set by users rather than some central authority.\nsecond, back in january 2021 we build a simple landing page explaining our vision and roadmap. as soon as we published it and shared with some friends and colleagues, our community started to grow very quickly as it turned out our product was needed by many people. a week later we completed our token sale (closing the hard cap in 9 seconds) and secured necessary funding for building the product.\nthird, we found and onboarded top-class engineers. our technical team consists of highly skilled professionals who are very passionate about writing elegant, clean and efficient code. in the past, they won numerous hackathons and have many years of experience with solidity, rust, and different blockchains.\nforth, on our main page we published a countdown \u2013 45 days from toke sale to production. those 1.5 months we worked 12-18 hours every day, mostly without weekends. and we kept the promise to our token holders by launching the product on the declared date \u2013 the 12th of april 2021.\nfifth, over the last 8 months we were making improvements, fixing bugs, and adding numerous features. it\u2019s faire to say that we rebuilt the protocol completely since the first launch. we expanded the protocol to 8 chains and listed over 100 tokens for leveraged trading. from the business perspective, we significantly expanded our team, and formed many great partnerships with other projects, dexes, marketing companies, investors and influencers. currently, our product is very strong, battle-tested, and ready for mass adoption.\nchallenges we ran into\nbuilding a protocol from scratch was a challenge because we had to create a totally new product, inventing algorithms, and math behind them. for example, most leveraged trading platforms require users to deposit some collateral before making the trade. in wowswap, no collateral is required because wowswap automatically turns purchased tokens into the collateral.\ncreating our own protection against flash loan attacks. many defi protocols were victims of flash loan attacks,

It will help improve access to nutritious food in local communities and those suffering from acute hunger. Idea is to design a Mobile Application (App Name: ZHunger) which will ensure people in hunger receives food as well as it will ensure that food provider doesn't waste food and provide the needy on time. Also to improve access to nutritious food in local communities, especially those suffering from acute hunger, co-operative systems can be digitized and enhanced.\nBy aggregating and analyzing the market, transportation, demand, horticultural, and environmental data, co-ops can optimize productivity, reduce overhead, and decrease volatility in the supply chain of the farming communities.

After researching a bit we concluded that of course, we cannot change the govt laws but we can definitely: ensure farmers get MSP and use ai services break all geographical barriers for buying and selling privatization protecting interests of farmers\nWhat it does\nSo basically Cropwayy is for farmers, retailers, corporates, and wholesalers wherein uses can:\nFARMERS\ncreate an account and fill in profile details view about us, contact us and visit crop gallery Use smart services like crop disease detection, fertilizer prediction and crop recommendation to enhance the crop yield Sell their crops to verified wholesalers and retailers without any middleman or geographical foundation by just posting a description of the crop.( No sales below MSP to protect farmers) Get hired on contract basis by different corporates.( No contract is made below MSP to protect farmers)\nCORPORATE\ncreate an account and fill in profile details view about us, contact us and visit crop gallery Hire farmers from all over India on contract basis\nWHOLESALERS\ncreate an account and fill in profile details view about us, contact us and visit crop gallery Can buy crops directly from farmers Can sell crops to retailers\nRETAILERS\ncreate an account and fill in profile details view about us, contact us and visit crop gallery Can buy crops directly from farmers/ wholesalers\nHow we built it\nSince we are quite comfortable in python and flask, we choose to build our project with the following tech stack:\nPython 3 Flask HTML/ CSS MySQL Bootstrap Tensorflow Machine Learning PowerBI Heroku GoDaddy\nChallenges we ran into\nOne of the biggest challenges we faced was finding a correct solution to help farmers, local wholesalers, contractors, and retailers while keeping in mind we do not violate any government guidelines and laws. At first, it was difficult to find verified datasets for building various deep learning and machine learning models. Timing constraint was a very big challenge as we had to complete this project in less than 36 hours.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe are proud of our time management and teamwork that we completed an end-to-end project in less than 36 hours with sleepless nights. Our ML/DL model (Disease detection, fertilizer prediction,crop recomendation) accuracy is close to 99%. The interface of our web app is easy and multi-lingual, we believe that it is a one-stop solution for the agricultural supply chain industry.

Numerous agricultural lands have been converted into residential or industrial sectors. The reduction in agricultural land in urban areas has an impact on decreasing food production to meet the needs that continue to increase every year. By 2030, Indonesia targets to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural cultivation as one of the goals of the SDGs. Nevertheless, the land limitations and the resulting impacts may limit this. Hydroponics is a method of plant cultivation that can be a solution for food security in urban areas because hydroponics does not require soil and large areas. With advanced technology, the hydroponics system makes people grow plants independently, healthier and easier.\nWhat it does\nOn this issue, we aspire to educate urban communities by encouraging people to start urban farming by planting hydroponically in their own homes. The characteristics of urban people who tend to be busy finally inspired us to make automated hydroponic systems. So that people can still comfortably produce food independently. This hydroponic automation is equipped with a nutrient sensor that can control the nutrients so that plants will not lack or excess nutrients. In addition, we developed mobile apps with information about how to cultivate the plants, and monitor plant development remotely.\nHow we built it\nOur system is built using an Arduino Uno board which will control all the work of all components that are integrated into Arduino. The programming logic or coding will be made in the Arduino IDE software which has a C language base. The program that has been created will be embedded into the Arduino Uno board so that all integrated components will work according to the coding that has been made.\nChallenges we ran into\nThe challenge encountered in building hydroponic automation is that sometimes the coding made does not sync with the mechanization tools used because the tools have different specifications.

The $VIBES Token in turn allows users to unlock special access, receive limited edition NFT drops, as well as purchase products, programs, events, and subscriptions within the ecosystem.\nWe already have a marketplace app integrated into several networks. During the contest period, we worked on three pieces:\nintegrated our marketplace app into Theta Network. This allowed us to be one of the first marketplaces with a cross-chain feature on Theta.\ncreated a smart contract layer for NFT Liquidity Mining with TDROP. We know Theta's roadmap and our aim is to be the first 3rd-party NFT DApp built on the NFT marketplace smart contract (ThetaDrop NFT Marketplace Trading Engine) open-sourced by the Theta team.\nimproved the UIs and enhanced the feature set in our app to increase the use-cases of Liquidity Mining with TDROP.\nHow we built it\nWe have divided our workload into three main components: i)Theta network integration into the alpha version of our marketplace app, ii) Smart contract layer to be 3rd-party NFT DApp built on the NFT marketplace smart contract, and iii) enhancements of the user interfaces of our app.\nThe first part (alpha version of the app) can be tested from the link below. Here, we used the theta-eth-rpc-adaptor and deployed our smart contracts on Theta main network.\nhttps://app.vibes.org/\nA couple of transaction detail can be found in the below links\nTransaction 1: https://explorer.thetatoken.org/tx/0x1033e599c3fa610731ba2d0841de90ba3cd74974e1c8c8e919cf06f450a0329c Transaction 2: https://explorer.thetatoken.org/tx/0x124d510dea8e187cacc4346fce12cec246d5a90e5004986cf704cbe413d8e853\nMarketplace repos:\nhttps://github.com/HIGHVIBE/highvibe-frontend\nhttps://github.com/HIGHVIBE/highvibe-backend\nThe second part works with the flows below:\nIn addition to the main work of Engine integration, we have two unique contributions:\nAlternative ways to burn TFUEL: TDROP rewards are for NFT transactions only. What we will have is \u201cTDROP mining\u201d with actions/transactions like \u201clistening to morning meditation\u201d, \u201cwriting a journal\u201d or even with minor actions like \"tipping\" and \u201cclicking a like button\u201d. If they wish, users will pay a gas fee with TFUEL and mint a free NFT (as proof of action) and eventually collect TDROP reward.\nEnhance the reward system with $VIBES token: We have a reward model. After carefully reviewing the TDROP whitepaper, we ran a few simulation tests and decided to revise our reward model with additional parameters. While determining the TDROP reward amount, the algorithm looks at the maximum price in past and takes the difference between the current price and the maximum price. If the difference is minus the reward is a very small parameter, it is minimal. This might be necessary to eliminate wash trading but there are some projects that have real value, strong community but face low floor price for a period because of some technical problems at launch. For such projects, looking only at the historic maximum could be a bit harsh. We offer to look at the moving average of the floor price for the last few days. We have a formulation to find the difference in case the moving average would be used and compensate the difference with $VIBES token. This is to incentivize the collections that have temporary bad days.\nOur GitHub repo can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/HIGHVIBE/tdrop-mining\nHere are some of our TDROP mining examples use cases and descriptions:\nBasic TDROP mining\nBasic means basic, this method will be used for small awards such as \"writing a journal\" etc.\nHere is an example of TDROP mining output using Truffle tests.\nActions such as liking an NFT or adding it to the wishlist won't be rewarding as much as other actions, but the incentive is still there. TDROP rates are determined by the pre-defined parameters and we can create a harmony with the $VIBES reward anytime in the future depending on our live testing data.\nOur biggest TDROP mining use case is trading an NFT. With the trading engine Theta developers provided, we have started to assemble our systems, implement integration modules/contracts. So that we can be ready when TDROP farming goes live. With these mechanisms, we would like to incentivize collections that are experiencing brief setbacks, therefore, this use case should be as attractive as possible in terms of rewards.\nIt can be acknowledged that, by spending more amounts of VIBES or TFUEL, you can earn more TDROP tokens. By utilizing our algorithms, we will be constantly monitoring the Theta Network and adjusting our TDROP mining rates appropriately.\nFor the third part, we recorded a video and uploaded some of the screens to show a part of our app. It can be viewed on our project media.\nChallenges we ran into\nAs is known, TDROP farming is not yet open for testing outside of the Truffle Suite yet. Liquidity mining capability in ThetaDrop Trading Engine is expected to fail when tested against private Theta networks since it calls evm_mine to function. That means, to use this capability, we had to use javascript classes to compile, deploy and test our contracts inside Truffle with the Ganache network. Running Ganache locally is also a limiting factor when it comes to wide-scale testing. This problem can be easily fixed when TDROP becomes available for general use on the live Theta network, but for now, we had to implement a backend service to bypass the problem. In general, we were limited to showing our work by implementing it in our current app. So, we decided to provide terminal outputs to show that we have an up and running codebase.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe are proud of developing unique ideas to improve the implementation of the TDROP Liquidity Mining system. It should be noted that we already have several TDROP mining use cases implemented, test cases set up, and ready to integrate when TDROP mining becomes live.\nWe believe, we are ahead of many projects in the ecosystem and looking forward to collaborating in the near future.\nWhat we learned\nDuring the Contest Period, ThetaDrop had many valuable launches such as the Secret Pineapple Society. By observing these processes, we learned how we can improve our NFT collection launch projects and enhance our marketplace app.\nWhat's next for Highvibe Network NFTs Minting and Marketplace\nAs mentioned, we are planning to add new features to our app. Our smart contracts and UIs are ready. We will be working on the frontend and testing our contracts along with our app to be ready before February 2022 TDROP launch.\nUpdate: Based on our request, Magic.link has agreed to integrate Theta Network. Offering a non-custodial wallet as a 'passwordless' onboarding experience to Web3. This is a great feature that will help the entire Theta ecosystem and will also help with network effects for anyone already using this solution. Moreover, as seen in our demo, this doesn't prevent anyone from also using other non-custodial wallets.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/highvibe-network-nfts-minting-and-marketplace",

repos:\nhttps://github.com/highvibe/highvibe-frontend\nhttps://github.com/highvibe/highvibe-backend\nthe second part works with the flows below:\nin addition to the main work of engine integration, we have two unique contributions:\nalternative ways to burn tfuel: tdrop rewards are for nft transactions only. what we will have is \u201ctdrop mining\u201d with actions/transactions like \u201clistening to morning meditation\u201d, \u201cwriting a journal\u201d or even with minor actions like \"tipping\" and \u201cclicking a like button\u201d. if they wish, users will pay a gas fee with tfuel and mint a free nft (as proof of action) and eventually collect tdrop reward.\nenhance the reward system with $vibes token: we have a reward model. after carefully reviewing the tdrop whitepaper, we ran a few simulation tests and decided to revise our reward model with additional parameters. while determining the tdrop reward amount, the algorithm looks at the maximum price in past and takes the difference between the current price and the maximum price. if the difference is minus the reward is a very small parameter, it is minimal. this might be necessary to eliminate wash trading but there are some projects that have real value, strong community but face low floor price for a period because of some technical problems at launch. for such projects, looking only at the historic maximum could be a bit harsh. we offer to look at the moving average of the floor price for the last few days. we have a formulation to find the difference in case the moving average would be used and compensate the difference with $vibes token. this is to incentivize the collections that have temporary bad days.\nour github repo can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/highvibe/tdrop-mining\nhere are some of our tdrop mining examples use cases and descriptions:\nbasic tdrop mining\nbasic means basic, this method will be used for small awards such as \"writing a journal\" etc.\nhere is an example of tdrop mining output using truffle tests.\nactions such as liking an nft or adding it to the wishlist won't be rewarding as much as other actions, but the incentive is still there. tdrop rates are determined by the pre-defined parameters and we can create a harmony with the $vibes reward anytime in the future depending on our live testing data.\nour biggest tdrop mining use case is trading an nft. with the trading engine theta developers provided, we have started to assemble our systems, implement integration modules/contracts. so that we can be ready when tdrop -----> farming !!!  goes live. with these mechanisms, we would like to incentivize collections that are experiencing brief setbacks, therefore, this use case should be as attractive as possible in terms of rewards.\nit can be acknowledged that, by spending more amounts of vibes or tfuel, you can earn more tdrop tokens. by utilizing our algorithms, we will be constantly monitoring the theta network and adjusting our tdrop mining rates appropriately.\nfor the third part, we recorded a video and uploaded some of the screens to show a part of our app. it can be viewed on our project media.\nchallenges we ran into\nas is known, tdrop farming is not yet open for testing outside of the truffle suite yet. liquidity mining capability in thetadrop trading engine is expected to fail when tested against private theta networks since it calls evm_mine to function. that means, to use this capability, we had to use javascript classes to compile, deploy and test our contracts inside truffle with the ganache network. running ganache locally is also a limiting factor when it comes to wide-scale testing. this problem can be easily fixed when tdrop becomes available for general use on the live theta network, but for now, we had to implement a backend service to bypass the problem. in general, we were limited to showing our work by implementing it in our current app. so, we decided to provide terminal outputs to show that we have an up and running codebase.\naccomplishments that we're proud of\nwe are proud of developing unique ideas to improve the implementation of the tdrop liquidity mining system. it should be noted that we already have several tdrop mining use cases implemented, test cases set up, and ready to integrate when tdrop mining becomes live.\nwe believe, we are ahead of many projects in the ecosystem and looking forward to collaborating in the near future.\nwhat we learned\nduring the contest period, thetadrop had many valuable launches such as the secret pineapple society. by observing these processes, we learned how we can improve our nft collection launch projects and enhance our marketplace app.\nwhat's next for highvibe network nfts minting and marketplace\nas mentioned, we are planning to add new features to our app. our smart contracts and uis are ready. we will be working on the frontend and testing our contracts along with our app to be ready before february 2022 tdrop launch.\nupdate: based on our request, magic.link has agreed to integrate theta network. offering a non-custodial wallet as a 'passwordless' onboarding experience to web3. this is a great feature that will help the entire theta ecosystem and will also help with network effects for anyone already using this solution. moreover, as seen in our demo, this doesn't prevent anyone from also using other non-custodial wallets.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": 36, "comments": 13, "media": null,

emissions and has a huge land, water, and energy footprint, so reducing meat consumption is a major opportunity for people to lessen environmental harm. In contrast to plant agriculture, modern animal agriculture is often perceived to be cruel to animals and unhealthy for humans. Eating more plants and less meat could help society reduce diseases, avert animal cruelty, and address the climate and biodiversity crises. Since governments play roles in responding to emergencies, conserving natural resources, managing food systems, and providing energy and healthcare, reducing meat consumption can help governments reduce expenses, and thus is in the interest of taxpayers. Clearly, plant-based diets offer many benefits for society.\nLimited information\nYet, such diets remain inaccessible to most people. One barrier to entry is that assessing to what extent a food vendor offers plant-based items remains inefficient. Plant-based items on menus often go unlabeled and user-contributed attribute information is often inaccurate, potentially making it difficult for even seasoned veg*ns to assess whether a plant-based meal is available at a given establishment. This can lead users to manually search through reviews, which can be time-consuming and often fails to produce a resounding answer.\nBeyond the veg/non-veg binary\nIn addition, the existing dietary information ecosystem can contribute to a divergence between places with many plant-based options and those with none. Veg*ns, in the face of uncertainty, may seek out food vendors that are entirely vegan or vegetarian, while meat eaters (who are the majority) remain at places with few plant-based options. This presents a barrier for entry for many eaters because transitioning to a plant-based diet may necessitate dramatically changing where they obtain their food, which can require research and impact social relationships with non-veg*ns. If veg and non-veg restaurants were less separated, it would be easier for consumers to transition to plant-based diets, and easier for veg*ns to find places to eat. Creating an indicator of vegan options could create an incentive for food vendors with animal-based menus to add plant-based options, and thus catalyze more blended menus. We believe that modern technology could be leveraged to create such an indicator.\nWhat it does\nGiven a food vendor review page, our software calculates a veg options index for the vendor, indicating how likely they are to have veg options.\nHow we built it\nWe modified a Chrome extension template and used content scripts to edit the document object model (DOM).\nChallenges we ran into\nOne obstacle to our original implementation plan was that the Yelp API cannot be used to access more than three reviews of any business.

However, more importantly, it could include other metrics too, such as ethical farming practices or carbon footprint. Being directly aware of the impacts of these restaurants also makes people more likely to take action based on their views, such as through voting candidates who support environmentally friendly policies or work towards implementing solutions for climate change.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/vegoptions", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost", "result": true, "Selector": "farming", "selectorShort": "farming", "MarkedSent": "inspiration\npotential of plant-based diets\nmeat production results in massive ghg emissions and has a huge land, water, and energy footprint, so reducing meat consumption is a major opportunity for people to lessen environmental harm. in contrast to plant agriculture, modern animal agriculture is often perceived to be cruel to animals and unhealthy for humans. eating more plants and less meat could help society reduce diseases, avert animal cruelty, and address the climate and biodiversity crises. since governments play roles in responding to emergencies, conserving natural resources, managing food systems, and providing energy and healthcare, reducing meat consumption can help governments reduce expenses, and thus is in the interest of taxpayers. clearly, plant-based diets offer many benefits for society.\nlimited information\nyet, such diets remain inaccessible to most people. one barrier to entry is that assessing to what extent a food vendor offers plant-based items remains inefficient. plant-based items on menus often go unlabeled and user-contributed attribute information is often inaccurate, potentially making it difficult for even seasoned veg*ns to assess whether a plant-based meal is available at a given establishment. this can lead users to manually search through reviews, which can be time-consuming and often fails to produce a resounding answer.\nbeyond the veg/non-veg binary\nin addition, the existing dietary information ecosystem can contribute to a divergence between places with many plant-based options and those with none. veg*ns, in the face of uncertainty, may seek out food vendors that are entirely vegan or vegetarian, while meat eaters (who are the majority) remain at places with few plant-based options. this presents a barrier for entry for many eaters because transitioning to a plant-based diet may necessitate dramatically changing where they obtain their food, which can require research and impact social relationships with non-veg*ns. if veg and non-veg restaurants were less separated, it would be easier for consumers to transition to plant-based diets, and easier for veg*ns to find places to eat. creating an indicator of vegan options could create an incentive for food vendors with animal-based menus to add plant-based options, and thus catalyze more blended menus. we believe that modern technology could be leveraged to create such an indicator.\nwhat it does\ngiven a food vendor review page, our software calculates a veg options index for the vendor, indicating how likely they are to have veg options.\nhow we built it\nwe modified a chrome extension template and used content scripts to edit the document object model (dom).\nchallenges we ran into\none obstacle to our original implementation plan was that the yelp api cannot be used to access more than three reviews of any business. as a result, we decided not to use the yelp api at this time.\nwhat we learned\nwe learned about creating chrome extensions and accessing review data.\nwhat's next for vegoptions\nvegoptions could feature machine learning and data science techniques to more accurately model the veg friendliness score. however, more importantly, it could include other metrics too, such as ethical -----> farming !!!  practices or carbon footprint. being directly aware of the impacts of these restaurants also makes people more likely to take action based on their views, such as through voting candidates who support environmentally friendly policies or work towards implementing solutions for climate change.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 59502963}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3197, "autor": "Cropwayy", "date": null, "content": "Inspiration\nLet me share with you where it all started.

There are many farmers in India who struggle with their farming lifestyle as it isn't very promising. The farmers lifestyle is heavily dependent on how their crops do and how well they are able to sell in their peak harvesting season. Many farmers are bound to large corporations to provide them with raw materials. Many have issues with how less they are being compensated for their harvests because while the farmers get paid the minimum for their labored produce, the corporation goes on and sells the same products for a higher price giving them a large sum of profits. On the other hand smaller farms who don't have ties with anyone count on locals to buy their fresh products, while they are poorly advertised many don't make much revenue and in reality lose more money than they gain.\nThis is where FarmVille comes in, in today's day and age everyone has gadgets or has some method of access to the internet. FarmVille allows farmers to be their own small business owners and host a virtual store in the app/website. By consumers buying straight from the farmers the prices will be very reasonable. In the app consumers are encouraged to write reviews on the products they have bought. The strategy of this app is designed similar to that of Etsy.com.\nWhat it does\nIt is an easily accessible website where farmers around the world can sell their fresh harvest to consumers for affordable and profitable prices.

And, much of the world\u2019s food is grown by small-scale, independent farms and distributed through local community cooperatives that sell the surplus produce. The co-ops are a central point for quality control, deliveries, and enabling food commodity markets. However, these co-ops face a myriad of logistical challenges to get the right food to the right places with minimal time and cost.\nShort Description\nIt's a platform that connects farmers to buyers and consumers.\nIdea/Innovation Opportunity Scenario\nIn this real-world global hunger challenge, the Design of a Mobile and Web app will act as a one-stop for creating awareness of food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture as well as help accomplish our goal of Zero Hunger. It will ensure that the food provider reduces food wastage and provides the food to the needy on time by any delivery platform. It will help improve access to nutritious food in local communities and those suffering from acute hunger. Idea is to design a Mobile Application (App Name: ZHunger) that will ensure people in hunger receives food as well as it will ensure that food provider doesn't waste food and provide the needy on time. Also to improve access to nutritious food in local communities, especially those suffering from acute hunger, co-operative systems can be digitized and enhanced.\nBy aggregating and analyzing the market, transportation, demand, horticultural, and environmental data, co-ops can optimize productivity, reduce overhead, and decrease volatility in the supply chain of the farming communities. Farmers would be able to upload the crop production photos for quality analysis and testing using AI and ML services after which they will receive the results via Messaging services. Learning from the User: Mobile will assess the behavior pattern of the user by observing the various tasks completed and helping the needy. It will notify the user to accomplish the goal, predict the necessary science behind the scene on the collected data, and will provide farmers and other users the information about food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture\nScalability plan/ Future Scope\nI expect to onboard other users in addition to traders and farmers who can come together, pull resources, and order food products directly from the farmers. This will reduce food wastage that occurs as goods await purchase in the market and increase savings.

These projects offer no-loss lottery by farming the money staked by everyone and reward randomly selected users.\nI really like the idea and I was thinking, could I make a similar project but instead of random selection it would require participants to do something to be rewarded.

From the time they bet until the time the bet is checked against the real value, their tokens are staked in a farming contract. Then the users who guess right within a range of 0.5% around the real price earn the whole farming reward.

After looking at the prompt, we realized we could implement it in a slightly similar way and create a farming simulation game which displays how various factors (weather, soil type, soil moisture) can affect crop yield and profit for farmers.\nWhat it does\nWhen the game runs, the player puts in their name and is shown a welcome message. Other aspects of the game that the player must input their own value for is how many acres they want to till, how many acres they want to allocate to the four crop choices (soybeans, peanuts, cotton, and corn), and how dense they want their crops to be planted. They also must put how much fertilizer or pesticide they want. Throughout the game the player is asked how much they want to water their crops. If the player goes past the limit for any of these factors (ex. watering too much or too less, allocating too much land to crops) then the particular question restarts. The random aspects of the game which the player can\u2019t control are the soil type and weather. For instance the player may get unhealthy soil, or extremely rainy weather and they must water and/or fertilize the crops accordingly.\nHow we built it\nBefore creating the functions, we initialized several global variables corresponding to the different values we\u2019d need to keep track of. For instance, the player variable would be used for the player name, the moisture variable stores the water level of the soil, the density is how dense the crops are planted, the soil variable actually represents the weather, and the ssize would store the amount of land allocated to soybeans and crsize is the amount of land allocated to corn. We then use these variables in various functions that represent different factors in the farming. For instance, there\u2019s a function for soil type which gives the player a certain type of soil using randint, and weather also uses randint to give the player a certain type of weather. We had 3 different watering functions where the player is prompted to add a certain amount of water to the crops, and they\u2019d have to take their soil type and the weather into consideration. At the end, the harvest function would take the moisture, soil type, density, and pest treatment into account and increase or decrease the crop yield accordingly, and then the crop profit.\nChallenges we ran into\nWe did have some merge conflicts, but we realized that in order to merge properly we had to work on only the part we assigned ourselves and commit then push before everyone could pull. We did have minor conflicts with implementing the functions: at times, we didn\u2019t assign variables properly and had issues with the operators, but after sharing our screens on zoom we were able to locate the issues and fix them.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe are proud that we were able to overcome the initial barriers that we faced when we first met on zoom. With none of us having participated in a hackathon before, we were really lost. However, we stuck with it and worked our way towards a submittable project that we are all proud of. Going through this project together from the beginning to end was a journey and I think everyone is proud of how we handled it.\nWhat we learned\nThe most important thing we learnt this weekend was how to collaborate on a coding project. With all of our experience coming from Computer Science classes at UNC, which are normally independent, none of us had ever collaborated in this manner. We learnt how to use github to push and pull commits from the main branch. We especially learned how to deal with merge conflicts that inevitably arose during the process of creating Argilife.\nWhat's next for Argilife\nWe would love to come back with more experience especially in the graphics department and find a way to animate the game and truly bring it to life. We chose to implement the Argilife concept as a text-based game as that is what fits our collective skill level. It would be rewarding, and perhaps a challenge for the future to create graphics for the game. Additionally, we would want to refine Argilife to be less abstract in some areas and use numbers that simulate real life more accurately.

Making their conditions worst day by day.\nWhat it does\nBasically, the project puts light on the small part of the farming that is being practiced nowadays.It generally focuses on the greenhouse-based farming system. The system is equipped with some special sensors and appliances so that the system can take the measurements whenever it is necessary to take possible measures depending upon the environmental parameters. This will give far better impact to the farmers by decreasing the labor cost, energy and time and increasing the production of the plant or the crop. In this small time span, I had included the possible appliances that can be fitted, such as, Cooling Fan, LED lights, Heater, a water pump, and a retractable roof. Some of the sensors are the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, moisture sensor, and light sensor. The system is designed with 2 modes- i) Manual mode- Each appliance can be controlled by the tap of the switches in the app that is also made by the MIT app inventory ii) Autonomous mode-Here each of the appliances will work automatically as instructed depending upon the input of the various sensors. (Here the appliances cannot be operated through the app) Now the special part of the project is the RETRACTABLE ROOF:- 1. When the system detects the sunlight over 80% then the roof will automatically be closed by the system.\nWhen the temperature goes below a threshold point the roof will also get automatically closed when the system senses the temperature going below the threshold point which can be harmful to the plant by closing the roof, so that the heat may remain in the room for a longer period of time. If the moisture goes above 60% the roof will also get close, to protect the plant from the heavy rain.\nMoreover, it can also check the plant disease type and can also help with what type of pesticides or measures to be taken.\nChallenges I ran into\nSome of the challenges I had faced:- i) To find a cardboard box for fixing the sensors and appliances ii)To find out what are the idle value of moisture, light, humidity, and temperature needed for the plant to set in the system iii) To develop an APP in the MIT app inventory as it was my first time developing app. iv)How to make the roof retractable and how should the roof will know the limits of its opening and closing position. v) How to get the values from Arduino to the BOLT module and again transfer them to the app.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/agribes-omhnle", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost", "result": true, "Selector": "farming", "selectorShort": "farming", "MarkedSent": "inspiration\ndue to the sudden change in climate the farmers are facing huge losses and lack precision -----> farming !!! . making their conditions worst day by day.\nwhat it does\nbasically, the project puts light on the small part of the farming that is being practiced nowadays.it generally focuses on the greenhouse-based farming system. the system is equipped with some special sensors and appliances so that the system can take the measurements whenever it is necessary to take possible measures depending upon the environmental parameters. this will give far better impact to the farmers by decreasing the labor cost, energy and time and increasing the production of the plant or the crop. in this small time span, i had included the possible appliances that can be fitted, such as, cooling fan, led lights, heater, a water pump, and a retractable roof. some of the sensors are the dht11 temperature and humidity sensor, moisture sensor, and light sensor. the system is designed with 2 modes- i) manual mode- each appliance can be controlled by the tap of the switches in the app that is also made by the mit app inventory ii) autonomous mode-here each of the appliances will work automatically as instructed depending upon the input of the various sensors.

It takes DeFi to the next maturity level from passive yield farming profits to active trading. It looks to disintermediate hedge funds and replace investment managers with software.\nWhat it does\nAnyone can launch an active trading strategy on the top of the protocol. Off-chain oracle network reads decentralised exchange trades and turns them into trading data (so-called candles). Then oracles feed the trading data to algorithms, written in Python, which decides on the next trading strategy position. Then an on-chain judge smart contract executes the trade and checks oracles were not faulty. The trading strategies are active and directional: long or short strategies, momentum, index, mean reversion and such.\nIn this hackathon, we build a trading strategy that keeps money in the Aave USDC pool when the trading strategy does not have an open position. The trading strategy is a simple boomer strategy called \"Double 7\" that buys in after 7 red candles and sells after 7 green. This enables greater trading capital efficiency than in the CeFi markets, because the CeFi markets lack money legos.\nHow we built it\nWe get raw trades and swaps and historical Aave interest rates from TheGraph protocol. These events are turned into trading data (candlestick chart). Then we backtest the strategy using Python algorithmic trading frameworks.\nThe actual trading happens on 1inch on Polygon network. We have a hedge fund smart contract written ins Solidity where users can invest and withdraw. The oracle network then instructs this smart contract to buy ETH when it is going up and sell ETH when it is going down. The decision is made by + 100 MB trading data from the oracle network.\nUsed infrastructure: Aave, TheGraph, 1inch, Polygon, MetaMask.\nChallenges we ran into\nAave subgraph was undocumented and even Aave developers did not know how it works. DeFi protocols need to invest in developer documentation more.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe are one of the first DeFi protocols doing active trading. Yield farming rewards will end one day. We will be ready and then you will come to us.\nWe go for an open trading position to interest rate pool in one transaction, never missing a heartbeat of interest. This kind of efficiency is not possible on traditional financial markets, because DeFi money legos, public ledger, open source and real-time transactions do not exist.\nWhat we learned\nUsing Aave USDC pool with variable interest rate increases moderate efficient trading strategy profitability from 17% to 21% which is considerable for low profitability, low risk, strategy.\nBuilding an off-chain specialised oracle system is hard, but we can easily beat ones like ChainLink.\nWhat's next for TradingStrategy.ai\nWe are raising a seed round and start live trading strategies in 1-2 months.\nIf you are an Defi angel investor contact us.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/tradingstrategy", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost", "result": true, "Selector": "farming", "selectorShort": "farming", "MarkedSent": "github links\ngithub links:\nhttps://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/ethlisbon\nhttps://github.com/danoctavian/tradingstrategy-ai-smart-contracts\nhttps://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/frontend/tree/ethlisbon\ninspiration\ntradingstrategy.ai is a protocol for running active trading strategies on-chain. it takes defi to the next maturity level from passive yield -----> farming !!!  profits to active trading. it looks to disintermediate hedge funds and replace investment managers with software.\nwhat it does\nanyone can launch an active trading strategy on the top of the protocol. off-chain oracle network reads decentralised exchange trades and turns them into trading data (so-called candles). then oracles feed the trading data to algorithms, written in python, which decides on the next trading strategy position. then an on-chain judge smart contract executes the trade and checks oracles were not faulty. the trading strategies are active and directional: long or short strategies, momentum, index, mean reversion and such.\nin this hackathon, we build a trading strategy that keeps money in the aave usdc pool when the trading strategy does not have an open position. the trading strategy is a simple boomer strategy called \"double 7\" that buys in after 7 red candles and sells after 7 green. this enables greater trading capital efficiency than in the cefi markets, because the cefi markets lack money legos.\nhow we built it\nwe get raw trades and swaps and historical aave interest rates from thegraph protocol. these events are turned into trading data (candlestick chart). then we backtest the strategy using python algorithmic trading frameworks.\nthe actual trading happens on 1inch on polygon network. we have a hedge fund smart contract written ins solidity where users can invest and withdraw. the oracle network then instructs this smart contract to buy eth when it is going up and sell eth when it is going down. the decision is made by + 100 mb trading data from the oracle network.\nused infrastructure: aave, thegraph, 1inch, polygon, metamask.\nchallenges we ran into\naave subgraph was undocumented and even aave developers did not know how it works. defi protocols need to invest in developer documentation more.\naccomplishments that we're proud of\nwe are one of the first defi protocols doing active trading. yield farming rewards will end one day. we will be ready and then you will come to us.\nwe go for an open trading position to interest rate pool in one transaction, never missing a heartbeat of interest. this kind of efficiency is not possible on traditional financial markets, because defi money legos, public ledger, open source and real-time transactions do not exist.\nwhat we learned\nusing aave usdc pool with variable interest rate increases moderate efficient trading strategy profitability from 17% to 21% which is considerable for low profitability, low risk, strategy.\nbuilding an off-chain specialised oracle system is hard, but we can easily beat ones like chainlink.\nwhat's next for tradingstrategy.ai\nwe are raising a seed round and start live trading strategies in 1-2 months.\nif you are an defi angel investor contact us.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": 6, "comments": 1, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 59506536}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6656, "autor": "OASISFISH - A DAML way to save Marine friends", "date": null, "content": "Inspiration\nIncreased demands for fish products continues to increase worldwide, nations face a challenge to ensure Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) products are not entering their markets.

The whole procedure of water treatment will be cost effective, Environment friendly procedure and also find out the location the waste waters.\nWhat it does\nIn the rural areas there are so many waste waters and we have to find all the water bodies and this also a part a water treatment procedure. Next we have to maintain the costs for that we can use plastic bricks in the treatment procedure. Plastic brick is also eco-friendly and it can be used as waste management also. So with focusing the treatment of the water we can also reduce plastic or wastes to save our environment.\nHow we built it\nRaw water:- Raw water is water found in the environment that has not been treated and does not have any of its minerals, ions, particles, bacteria, or parasites removed. Raw water includes rain water, ground water, water from infiltration wells, and water from bodies like lakes and rivers. Raw water is generally unsafe for human consumption due to the presence of contaminants without treatment; raw water can be used for farming, construction or cleaning. Screening:- wastewater screening is the forest unit operation in all wastewater treatment plants. Screen is the device used to retain solids found in the influent wastewater to the treatment plant. The main purpose of screening is to remove solid materials that cloud- Cause damage to other process equipment. Cause reduction in efficiency of the whole system Contaminate waterways. The materials that are removed using screens are called screening. The screen is placed in 45-60 degrees in order to increase the effective surface area of the screen. Aeration: - Aeration is the process by which air is circulated through, mixed with pr dissolved in a liquid or substance. Aeration brings water and air in close contact in order to remove dissolved gasses and to oxidize dissolved metals, including iron, hydrogen sulphide, and volatile organic chemicals. This process is typically the first major process at drinking water treatment plants, and occurs in the secondary treatment process of activated sludge treatment in wastewater treatment plants. Plane sedimentation: - After the process of aeration the raw water goes to the plane sedimentation tank. Where the water rests for 4-10 minutes. After the rest of 10 minutes. After the detention period heavy particles are sedimented. Sedimentation with coagulation with the help of flocculation: - After plane sedimentation the raw water goes to the next tank where we manually add alum and mith the alum with the help of flocculator. And separate the suspended solids portion from the water. Filtration:- After all the above process the raw water goes to the filtration tank. In the tank there are three bed sand, charcoal and stone chips to filter the water. Disinfection:- After the process of filtration water goes to the disinfection tank. Where we manually add zeoline to remove the bacteria. Distribution tank: - After all the process the fresh water goes to the distribution tank. Then the fresh water goes to the required places. In the method we have to look various things. For treatment the water we have to locate the water bodies. The process is called Land under Land cover change. In the method we say trace the water bodies by mobile application with the help of the past conditions of the water bodies. Through an application development we can store data about land cover under land change of water bodies to make close observation about the current condition of water bodies in their locality, which will be possible from their honest input through the application and basic question and answer, which will be inbuilt in the application. After assessing all the inputs we can arrange awareness camps physically (if possible) or by auto generated reply through the application by assessing the data. We can also link this with our official college website from where people can directly find the information and suggestion by depending on their inputs. The input will be stored for the needful of the Government. The type of outcome can be canaling, harvesting of land. Even the storage of rain water can be used for different types of daily activities after proper treatment. Now we have to consider about the storage of the treated water. In this case we can use the bricks made of plastics. Plastic is very pollutant material and it also increases the wastes in the environment. So if we can use the plastics as a construction material we can also control and pollution as well as wastes. In the water treatment procedure we can use plastic bricks as a storage bed instead of using traditional construction materials. In this way we can reduce the costs of the treatment procedure in one way and can maintain the waste management. The following process we can make an plastic brick: \u2022 First of all, we need to collect plastic waste by separating it from other wastes. \u2022 We have to use dry plastic wastes and for that if the waste is wet, we have to dry the plastic waste to clear or remove the moisture content. \u2022 Then we have to crush the plastic wastes into small particles. \u2022 Then crush the small particles into fine size particles. \u2022 The ratio of plastic and stone dust is 3:7. \u2022 By using sieve analysis the stone dust is sieved in less than 4.75mm. \u2022 Then heat the stone dust on a furnace. \u2022 Fine particles are also heated in the furnace until it becomes liquid form. \u2022 Then add the stone dust into the melted plastic. \u2022 Then mix both properly and make a perfect mix. \u2022 Then pour the mix into molds. \u2022 Then keep the mold for dry and demolds it on the next day.

Often, however, rewards from yield farming sit stagnant and unclaimed. In order to get the greatest return from a yield farm, you have to manually reinvest your rewards-- this takes at least 180 seconds per yield farm even for experienced users. This is an extremely involved process, and requires deep knowledge of defi concepts. As a result, most users are likely to miss out on the benefits of compound interest, which can result in around 30% higher ROI (for an 80% APR farm-- the current rate of UBE-SBR-- and comparing daily reinvestment to bi-annual). \"Autocompounders\" for yield farming positions do exist, but still require deep defi knowledge, charge extremely high fees (as high as 4%), are poorly decentralized, and are not extensible. For the crypto newbie, entering the defi world with yield farming is still not an accessible option.\nWhat it does\nOur project, Revo (\"dream\" in Esperanto), allows users to directly exchange any ERC20 token (think: cUSD, cEUR, CELO) for a staked, auto-compounded position in an underlying yield farm. The onboarding process takes only seconds, fees are extremely small (on the order of magnitude of traditional \"swap\" fees), and the auto-compounding process is completely decentralized. This allows all users, and importantly, those new to defi, to \"zap-in\" to an auto-compounded yield farming position in only a few clicks -- in less time than it would traditionally take to join a yield farm without auto-compounding!\nAuto-compounded shares of yield farming positions are implemented as ERC20 tokens themselves, which means that users can directly move between auto-compounded positions in different yield farms. Traditionally, moving capital between different yield farms was a painstaking and expensive process; you have to unstake your LP, burn it, swap the component tokens to new ones, mint new LP, and finally stake it. This is a tiring, and potentially costly process, incurring several swap fees along the way; at the end of it all, you're left with a staked position that you still have to compound manually. Being able to move directly between auto-compounded positions in underlying yield farms is both easier and cheaper than the traditional approach.\nHow we built it\nAuto-compounded shares of staked yield farming positions are implemented as tokenized shares of an ERC20-compliant smart contract, referred to as FP, or Farm Point tokens. For each underlying farm, an FP contract is deployed. Users can deposit LP tokens of the underlying farm in order to mint FP for themselves; the FP contract will hold the user's LP tokens and stake them in the farm on their behalf. Ownership of any amount of FP tokens represents a stake in an auto-compounded yield farm; as rewards are auto-compounded, each FP becomes worth more of the underlying LP. At any point, a user may burn their FP in exchange for an amount of LP according to the current conversion ratio between FP and LP.\nAuto-compounding is implemented via a public method on the FP contract that anyone can call to re-invest any staking rewards that are owed to the FP contract. To incentivize users to call this method, the caller is rewarded with a small fraction of the claimed rewards, on the order of a traditional \"swap\" fee; currently, this sits at around 0.1% of rewards. We have released an open-source bot which will automatically call the compound function when it's in the caller's financial interest to do so. We hope that this encourages community members to run the bot in order to support the Revo platform.\nThe above summary doesn't explain how the \"zap-in\" feature from any ERC20 token works. Both the \"zap-in\" feature and the ability to directly swap between auto-compounded stakes in different farms are direct results of the fact that \"Farm Points\" are implemented as ERC20 tokens themselves.\nBy deploying traditional liquidity pools between commonly-used ERC20 tokens (e.g., cUSD, cEUR) and each of our FP tokens, users are able to directly swap for auto-compounded shares of yield farms. Note, that by only deploying one pool per FP token, users are now able to swap any ERC20 token for FP tokens, so long as there exists a swap path between the original token and the FP token. A direct result of this is that users are able to swap one FP for another, moving freely between auto-compounded yield farming positions in different farms.\nAs more users \"zap-in\" to FP positions, the liquidity in the ERC20-FP pools may become imbalanced; this could result in it being cheaper to swap for FP than it is to mint it directly by depositing LP, or vice-versa. In either case, an arbitrage opportunity exists, where users can mint new FP and swap it in the liquidity pool for a free profit, or swap for FP for cheaper than it would cost to mint it. This opportunity for arbitrage actually encourages new LP to be minted, directly supporting liquidity in the underlying pools, and the health of the Celo ecosystem at large. As more users \"zap-in\" for FP shares, the presence of arbitrage opportunities ensures that new FP, and thus LP, will be minted. To encourage users to engage in this arbitrage, we have written and published an open-source arbitrage bot to perform this arbitrage on the Revo platform.\nOn top of all the infrastructure and tooling, we have also written and deployed a user-friendly, mobile-first frontend for the Revo platform, where users can swap their tokens directly for auto-compounded yield farm positions (FP), provide liquidity to the Revo liquidity pools, and directly mint or burn their FP in exchange for LP of the underlying farm.\nChallenges we ran into\nWe certainly ran into a bunch of challenges along the way. Of course, the challenge of writing correct smart contract code existed throughout the process, but by far the most difficult part was coming up with a truly decentralized protocol that's gas-efficient and incentivizes users to support the auto-compounding process. Some short-term concessions had to be made for the sake of time; a few parameters of the FP contracts are only configurable by the owner, such as slippage tolerance, reward rate for the auto-compound caller, and swap paths for reinvesting rewards.\nAnother challenge was developing a deep understanding of the underlying smart contract structure of current yield farming systems. Since our FP contracts interact very closely with the inner workings of yield farms, there was a steep learning curve around the underlying yield farming systems.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWe're extremely proud of the platform we've developed, both for how it can be leveraged by defi power users and crypto newbies alike, and the technological innovation it presents. Primarily, we're proud to have created a system that can drastically ease the on-ramp to defi, and provide a useful service for more experienced users who are looking for a way to move between yield farming positions easily. The fact that we were able to do this at an extremely low cost to end-users and in a truly decentralized way is something we're very happy with.\nOn the technological front, we're proud of the innovation of representing auto-compounded yield farm stakes as shares of an ERC20-compliant token. Tokenizing an auto-compounded yield farming share was kind of a mind-blowing idea to us, and something that none of us had seen in defi before. Implementing FP as an ERC20 token opens up a ton of space for future development and for others to build on top of our platform, and we're really excited about what could come next.\nWhat we learned\nWe learned a ton about what it takes to deploy a proper dApp from start to finish, including protocol design, writing smart contracts, providing developer tooling for ecosystem support, and shipping an MVP frontend. There's a ton of work required to get a platform like this off the ground! We also learned a lot about the current pains involved with yield farming and compounding rewards. We learned about current solutions for these problems on the Celo platform, and how they are less than ideal at addressing some of the more fundamental issues and pains around participation in yield farming.\nWhat's next for Revo\nWe have a bunch of plans for improving and extending Revo. Due to the time constraints of the hackathon, we were not able to implement as much as we would have liked to, and had to make some compromises in order to get a working prototype off the ground before the deadline.\nCurrently, Revo only supports underlying yield farms from the Ubeswap platform. One obvious extension to the platform is adding support for yield farms on different underlying platforms, such as Sushi and Symmetric. This would allow users to directly swap between autocompounded positions on different yield farming platforms.\nAnother huge milestone we'd love to reach is the issuance of a governance token. Currently, key contract parameters are not determined in a fully decentralized way. By issuing a governance token, we can allow users of the platform to vote on parameters such as reward rates for auto-compounders and swap paths. Additionally, we could use the governance token as a reward for users who call the auto-compound function on our contracts in order to make our platform truly free for FP holders. We could also deploy yield farms for our liquidity pools and provide governance token rewards to those who stake their LP.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/compound-interest", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost", "result": true, "Selector": "farming", "selectorShort": "farming", "MarkedSent": "urls\npr against celo-org repository\nrevo github organization\nprototype frontend (alfajores only)\nmain revo repository\nrevo contracts\nrevo interface\nrevo arbitrage bot\nrevo auto-compounding bot\ninspiration\nyield -----> farming !!!  on top of being a liquidity provider can offer excellent incentives, and can act as a great way to get into the defi ecosystem. often, however, rewards from yield farming sit stagnant and unclaimed. in order to get the greatest return from a yield farm, you have to manually reinvest your rewards-- this takes at least 180 seconds per yield farm even for experienced users. this is an extremely involved process, and requires deep knowledge of defi concepts. as a result, most users are likely to miss out on the benefits of compound interest, which can result in around 30% higher roi (for an 80% apr farm-- the current rate of ube-sbr-- and comparing daily reinvestment to bi-annual). \"autocompounders\" for yield farming positions do exist, but still require deep defi knowledge, charge extremely high fees (as high as 4%), are poorly decentralized, and are not extensible. for the crypto newbie, entering the defi world with yield farming is still not an accessible option.\nwhat it does\nour project, revo (\"dream\" in esperanto), allows users to directly exchange any erc20 token (think: cusd, ceur, celo) for a staked, auto-compounded position in an underlying yield farm. the onboarding process takes only seconds, fees are extremely small (on the order of magnitude of traditional \"swap\" fees), and the auto-compounding process is completely decentralized. this allows all users, and importantly, those new to defi, to \"zap-in\" to an auto-compounded yield farming position in only a few clicks -- in less time than it would traditionally take to join a yield farm without auto-compounding!\nauto-compounded shares of yield farming positions are implemented as erc20 tokens themselves, which means that users can directly move between auto-compounded positions in different yield farms. traditionally, moving capital between different yield farms was a painstaking and expensive process; you have to unstake your lp, burn it, swap the component tokens to new ones, mint new lp, and finally stake it. this is a tiring, and potentially costly process, incurring several swap fees along the way; at the end of it all, you're left with a staked position that you still have to compound manually. being able to move directly between auto-compounded positions in underlying yield farms is both easier and cheaper than the traditional approach.\nhow we built it\nauto-compounded shares of staked yield farming positions are implemented as tokenized shares of an erc20-compliant smart contract, referred to as fp, or farm point tokens. for each underlying farm, an fp contract is deployed. users can deposit lp tokens of the underlying farm in order to mint fp for themselves; the fp contract will hold the user's lp tokens and stake them in the farm on their behalf. ownership of any amount of fp tokens represents a stake in an auto-compounded yield farm; as rewards are auto-compounded, each fp becomes worth more of the underlying lp. at any point, a user may burn their fp in exchange for an amount of lp according to the current conversion ratio between fp and lp.\nauto-compounding is implemented via a public method on the fp contract that anyone can call to re-invest any staking rewards that are owed to the fp contract. to incentivize users to call this method, the caller is rewarded with a small fraction of the claimed rewards, on the order of a traditional \"swap\" fee; currently, this sits at around 0.1% of rewards. we have released an open-source bot which will automatically call the compound function when it's in the caller's financial interest to do so. we hope that this encourages community members to run the bot in order to support the revo platform.\nthe above summary doesn't explain how the \"zap-in\" feature from any erc20 token works. both the \"zap-in\" feature and the ability to directly swap between auto-compounded stakes in different farms are direct results of the fact that \"farm points\" are implemented as erc20 tokens themselves.\nby deploying traditional liquidity pools between commonly-used erc20 tokens (e.g., cusd, ceur) and each of our fp tokens, users are able to directly swap for auto-compounded shares of yield farms. note, that by only deploying one pool per fp token, users are now able to swap any erc20 token for fp tokens, so long as there exists a swap path between the original token and the fp token. a direct result of this is that users are able to swap one fp for another, moving freely between auto-compounded yield farming positions in different farms.\nas more users \"zap-in\" to fp positions, the liquidity in the erc20-fp pools may become imbalanced;

Crypto has changed this forever \u2014 currently, all major cryptocurrency exchanges offer margin trading accounts. On centralized stock and cryptocurrency exchanges traders borrow additional capital from brokers and exchange operators who decide on lending rates, fees and procedures for liquidating risky leveraged positions. However, on centralized trading platforms their operators have full control over leveraged trading rules, including decisions on capital lending rates, assets available for leveraged trading, and liquidation procedures.\nWOWswap democratizes leveraged trading further by giving all power to the community. With WOW protocol liquidity providers can create and operate common liquidity pools, and traders can borrow these funds for their leveraged trades according to the rules collectively established by WOW token holders.\nIn decentralized finance (DeFi) leveraged trading also should be decentralized: community needs to be able to create and operate common liquidity pools and decide on leverage trading rules. So, WOWswap has adopted a fully transparent and democratic governance model: WOW token holders can vote onchain and change all parameters of the protocol instantly.\nFirst, we built WOWswap on EVM-compatible blockchains (Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, IoTeX, Polygon, and HECO) but Solana's unmatched speed and low transaction costs inspired us to bring WOWswap to Solana.\nWhat it does\nOn Solana WOWswap works on top of Serum DEX. Using WOWswap\u2019s smart-contracts individual liquidity providers create and operate common liquidity pools, and traders borrow these funds to finance their leveraged trades on Serum DEX.\nIf the price of the token that a trader buys goes up, the trader receives a multiplied profit. However, if the price of the token goes down the trader suffers a multiplied loss. When a trader closes a leveraged trading position, the liquidity pool receives back the borrowed funds plus the accrued interest.\nIf the token price goes below the liquidation threshold, then anyone can become a margin caller by triggering the liquidation of the trader's position. In this case the trader will lose all capital invested in the trade, and the margin caller gets the rest of the funds as a reward.\nWOWswap allows to borrow additional capital in $SOL, $USDT, and $USDC to buy other tokens with leverage. At launch over 30 tokens are supported.\nHow we built it\nInspired by our EVM implementation available on BSC, Ethereum, Matic, Heco, Avalance and IoTex.\nAnchor framework made by Serum was very helpful to build product without headache about core mechanics such as serialization and deserialization and account management.\nBig difference in design of Solana and Ethereum networks made us to build everything from scratch, including the UI.\nChallenges we ran into\nOn EVM-compatible blockchains we route trades via AMMs, such as Uniswap, Quickswap, etc. However, due to the lack of AMM protocols (with open source) on Solana we had to use order book -based Serum DEX. It was interesting and challenging to built leveraged DEX on top of Serum.\nSerum DEX and SPL Token are using unsigned integers with just 64 bits of accuracy. It was a challenge to stay in limits and do not lose rate accuracy.\nWhat we learned\nSolana is way faster than EVM-compatible chains and sometimes it feels like we run on a local devnet and not on a decentralized network.\nSolana requires to clear your mind and think in an absolutely new way compared to the world state in Ethereum.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nWOWswap has been running on EVM compatible blockchains since April 12, 2021. Since then we have succeeded in the following areas:\nRanked #1 platform by the number of supported assets (over 100 tokens across 7 chains)\nIntegrated into the UI of Pangolin DEX (Avalanche) and Mimo DEX (IoTex)\nFully audited by Hacken, running 6 months without incidents\nTVL > $2,000,000\nIntegrated with Pancakeswap, Quickswap, Pangolin, Sushiswap, Mimo, Mdex, Serum\nIn DeFi we are proud of the following achievements:\nLaunched on 6 EVM compatible blockchains.\nNo collateral deposit is required before opening a trading position\nLeveraged trading for fractionalized NFTs\nAll protocol\u2019s parameters can be changed instantly via on-chain governance\nFirst onchain referral program with referral payouts paid by a smart contract\nSpeaking of Solana, we are very proud to introduce major improvements over Mango Markets:\n1. Planning a trade\nIn Mango Markets a user is required to deposit a collateral before opening a trading position. In WOWswap no collateral deposit is necessary - the purchased tokens become the collateral automatically.\nIn Mango Markets a user cannot specify a leverage - effective leveraged will be calculated based on the total collateral and a desired amount of purchasable tokens. In WOWswap a users can easily specify a required leverage - UI is very simple to understand and trade.\n2. Opening a trading position\nMargo Market's UI does not check if a trade will succeed or not. WOWswap prevents trades that can not be executed.\nMargo Market's UI does not show liquidation price and borrow rate when a user opens a trade. WOWswap shows all important parameters of the trade.\n3. Closing a trading position\nIn Mango Markets settling debt requires depositing borrowed currency. In WOWswap the debt settles automatically by selling the collateral\n4. Supported assets\nMango Markets currently supports 7 digital assets for leveraged trading on Solana. At launch WOWswap supports 30+ on Solana and hundreds tokens on other chains, including fractionalized NFTs on Ethereum.\nWhat's next for WOWswap\n1. Launching onchain governance on Solana\nFirst of all, we would like to add more features on Solana that we already implemented on EVM-compatible blockchains:\nInstant onchain governance for changing all protocol's economic and financial parameters\nIntroduce short-selling functionality\nIntroduce leveraged trading for Fractionalized NFTs (already works on our Ethereum version)\n2. Launching WOWswap Pro\nWowswap interface is minimalistic and is extremely easy to use. In fact, opening leveraged short or long position takes just 1-click. Yet we recognize the demand for more professional trading experience to maximize those gains, therefore, we will soon launch WOWswap PRO to include more trading data, always-on chart and possibility to open a position and follow the portfolio in one page.\n3. Analytics page release\nFor all the data freaks, statistics page will display TVL, trading volume, total fees collected, interest rate changes as well as liquidation volume and trading volume changed per token.\n4. Efficient capital utilization \u2014 launching WOWswap Yield Aggregator\nAt the time of writing, APY on BNB and BUSD is 26% and 46%, respectively with only 17%+ percent of the pool utilization ratio. It means that more than 3/4s of the pooled assets are sitting idle.\nTo increase pool utilization efficiency we will launch WOWswap yield aggregator to farm rewards from other protocols. Adding a yield farming strategy could generate extra 10% to 15% extra APY to WOWswap liquidity providers. In the future, the same technology could be applied for proxy-tokens, which are pegged 1:1 to the underlying tokens and are held by WOW\u2019s smart-contract on your behalf.\n5. Enable WOW burn and reward distribution\nEvery time a trade makes a profit on a leveraged position, WOWswap protocol charges a fee of net profit made by traders, which is adjusted by the governance. Currently the fee goes to WOWswap treasury, but very soon we will start to burn WOW tokens and distribute the rest of the protocol\u2019s revenue to xWOW holders.\n6. Launch Phase 2 of WOWswap governance \u2014 WOWswap Improvement Proposals\nWOWswap On-chain Instant governance is live on selected blockchains, but some changes to the protocol require manual interference. Therefore, in the next phase WOWswap Improvement Proposals (WIP) portal will be launched where xWOW holders will be able to propose new tokens for listings, adding new features to the protocol, propose/vote on adding new charities for donations and more.\n7. UI/UX Optimization\nEven though the user interface on WOWswap is simple and is easy to use, there are a lot of moving parts under the hood that need to be improved, optimized and polished to make the experience as flawless as it can be. In the next few months we will focus on improving the UI experience, especially, for mobile users.", "link": "https://devpost.com/software/wowswap-lsdv9w", "origin": "Devpost", "suborigin": "Devpost",

are supported.\nhow we built it\ninspired by our evm implementation available on bsc, ethereum, matic, heco, avalance and iotex.\nanchor framework made by serum was very helpful to build product without headache about core mechanics such as serialization and deserialization and account management.\nbig difference in design of solana and ethereum networks made us to build everything from scratch, including the ui.\nchallenges we ran into\non evm-compatible blockchains we route trades via amms, such as uniswap, quickswap, etc. however, due to the lack of amm protocols (with open source) on solana we had to use order book -based serum dex. it was interesting and challenging to built leveraged dex on top of serum.\nserum dex and spl token are using unsigned integers with just 64 bits of accuracy. it was a challenge to stay in limits and do not lose rate accuracy.\nwhat we learned\nsolana is way faster than evm-compatible chains and sometimes it feels like we run on a local devnet and not on a decentralized network.\nsolana requires to clear your mind and think in an absolutely new way compared to the world state in ethereum.\naccomplishments that we're proud of\nwowswap has been running on evm compatible blockchains since april 12, 2021. since then we have succeeded in the following areas:\nranked #1 platform by the number of supported assets (over 100 tokens across 7 chains)\nintegrated into the ui of pangolin dex (avalanche) and mimo dex (iotex)\nfully audited by hacken, running 6 months without incidents\ntvl > $2,000,000\nintegrated with pancakeswap, quickswap, pangolin, sushiswap, mimo, mdex, serum\nin defi we are proud of the following achievements:\nlaunched on 6 evm compatible blockchains.\nno collateral deposit is required before opening a trading position\nleveraged trading for fractionalized nfts\nall protocol\u2019s parameters can be changed instantly via on-chain governance\nfirst onchain referral program with referral payouts paid by a smart contract\nspeaking of solana, we are very proud to introduce major improvements over mango markets:\n1. planning a trade\nin mango markets a user is required to deposit a collateral before opening a trading position. in wowswap no collateral deposit is necessary - the purchased tokens become the collateral automatically.\nin mango markets a user cannot specify a leverage - effective leveraged will be calculated based on the total collateral and a desired amount of purchasable tokens. in wowswap a users can easily specify a required leverage - ui is very simple to understand and trade.\n2. opening a trading position\nmargo market's ui does not check if a trade will succeed or not. wowswap prevents trades that can not be executed.\nmargo market's ui does not show liquidation price and borrow rate when a user opens a trade. wowswap shows all important parameters of the trade.\n3. closing a trading position\nin mango markets settling debt requires depositing borrowed currency. in wowswap the debt settles automatically by selling the collateral\n4. supported assets\nmango markets currently supports 7 digital assets for leveraged trading on solana. at launch wowswap supports 30+ on solana and hundreds tokens on other chains, including fractionalized nfts on ethereum.\nwhat's next for wowswap\n1. launching onchain governance on solana\nfirst of all, we would like to add more features on solana that we already implemented on evm-compatible blockchains:\ninstant onchain governance for changing all protocol's economic and financial parameters\nintroduce short-selling functionality\nintroduce leveraged trading for fractionalized nfts (already works on our ethereum version)\n2. launching wowswap pro\nwowswap interface is minimalistic and is extremely easy to use. in fact, opening leveraged short or long position takes just 1-click. yet we recognize the demand for more professional trading experience to maximize those gains, therefore, we will soon launch wowswap pro to include more trading data, always-on chart and possibility to open a position and follow the portfolio in one page.\n3. analytics page release\nfor all the data freaks, statistics page will display tvl, trading volume, total fees collected, interest rate changes as well as liquidation volume and trading volume changed per token.\n4. efficient capital utilization \u2014 launching wowswap yield aggregator\nat the time of writing, apy on bnb and busd is 26% and 46%, respectively with only 17%+ percent of the pool utilization ratio. it means that more than 3/4s of the pooled assets are sitting idle.\nto increase pool utilization efficiency we will launch wowswap yield aggregator to farm rewards from other protocols. adding a yield -----> farming !!!  strategy could generate extra 10% to 15% extra apy to wowswap liquidity providers. in the future, the same technology could be applied for proxy-tokens, which are pegged 1:1 to the underlying tokens and are held by wow\u2019s smart-contract on your behalf.\n5. enable wow burn and reward distribution\nevery time a trade makes a profit on a leveraged position, wowswap protocol charges a fee of net profit made by traders, which is adjusted by the governance. currently the fee goes to wowswap treasury, but very soon we will start to burn wow tokens and distribute the rest of the protocol\u2019s revenue to xwow holders.\n6. launch phase 2 of wowswap governance \u2014 wowswap improvement proposals\nwowswap on-chain instant governance is live on selected blockchains, but some changes to the protocol require manual interference. therefore, in the next phase wowswap improvement proposals (wip) portal will be launched where xwow holders will be able to propose new tokens for listings, adding new features to the protocol, propose/vote on adding new charities for donations and more.\n7. ui/ux optimization\neven though the user interface on wowswap is simple and is easy to use, there are a lot of moving parts under the hood that need to be improved, optimized and polished to make the experience as flawless as it can be. in the next few months we will focus on improving the ui experience, especially, for mobile users.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": 240, "comments": 57, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 59508530}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8554,

We had several ongoing commitments that we couldn't drop when it was announced, the Mango library development had just started and we found out at the last minute that we needed to integrate with Pyth as well.\nBeyond timing, the most pressing issues were avoiding RPC shanenigans and access to historical OHLCV data.\nWhat we learned\nOur learning experiences were mostly technical - on the Solana ecosystem they were mostly related to the Mango inner workings, as the Solnet libraries left us with some previous precious knowledge, and a deeper knowledge of the Avalonia framework.\nBeyond technical aspects, we have to admit that we learned a bit too late how to tackle scope creep.\nWhat's next for Project Citadel\nThis is nothing but the start for Citadel.
