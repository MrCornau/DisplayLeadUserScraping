Nowadays when I reach the summit or a very scenic spot I take some time to fish my phone from my bag to do a few selfies, videos, panaromas and the very best shots. I use my smartphone (a Galaxy Note 5) for 99% of my photos, so I only use the TS2 on these hikes when on the trail.\n\nNow I'm leaving in a few months to go hiking in Africa and the Kilimandjaro and I'd like some advice on what I should do or buy.\n\nWhat I need:\n* Something that is easily pocketable\n* Weather resistance\n* A wide-angle lens\n* Good battery life\n* Under 500$\n\nThis is what I'm considering:\n\nOption A) Keep my setup using the TS2 for \"normal\" shots and my phone for \"keepers\" or videos.\n\nMy concern is that the TS2 is really dated and I don't want to regret anything when I look and these photos in 15 years. My Note 5 is in a very robust case but still battery life is a concern, and If I drop it I'll be in trouble.\n\nOption B) Only use my phone.\n\nThis means getting an ultra rugged case with a thick screen protector. Plus, I really doesn't fit too well in my coat pocket with a full case.\n\nOption C) Buy another hiking camera and only use that.\n\nI'm seriously looking at an Olympus TG-5, but it's expensive and is the picture quality better than my Note 5? This is something I'll probably not be using more than 10-12 times per year after the Kilimandjaro trip and honestly I've done some many hikes that I don't *really* look at the photos much afterwards. And if I do buy a new camera, it would really have to be a compact and rugged model because these are the two things and newer smartphones don't do too well.\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions, thank you!\n\nEdit: It just occured to me that for the price of the TG-5 I could probably upgrade my phone for the Note 5 to the Note 8 and get a better phone AND camera.

The low resolution photos in the post showed what looked like some dust specs on the front element that would easily be blown off or wiped away. Anyway, I got the lens today and went to wipe off the dust but two spots remained - turns out they were actual scratches in the glass. Immediately I went to figure out if they affected the image, but even at f/22 I saw no evidence, so I tested to see if the light hitting the scratches even went to the sensor by placing my finger right over them and wiggling it and looking through the viewfinder.\n\nIt turns out that the scratches are actually right on the bottom of the front element, and the light that goes through them does not actually reach the sensor - it's in the part of the image circle that is not captured by the sensor. Of course the buyer had an inaccurate post (no mention of scratches; 'new - other' requires item to be in flawless condition) so I will most likely return it for a refund and buy a truly new one for about $15 more, but that's quite the hassle, hence my question: how much do scratches affect the resale value when they're cosmetic, even if they happen to be on the front element?\n\nI am following up with the seller to see if he was even aware of the scratches, and if not, how come he didn't even though he took photos of the front element. For reference it's a Tamron 24-70mm G2, which was released about a year ago, so there aren't that many used ones on the market.\n\ntldr; scratches on front element that only affect light not captured by the sensor since they're on the outside of the image circle.
