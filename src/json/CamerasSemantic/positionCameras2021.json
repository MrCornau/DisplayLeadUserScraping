It's important that our battalion takes photographs of what we do to create a public image. Unfortunately, since many of us are busy engineering students, it is rare that we come across someone that is a good photographer, or someone who has even taken basic classes. Every semester our photographer position changes meaning that oftentimes, it's difficult to even prepare for the role.\n\nWe are currently searching for a new camera as our old one is starting to get outdated. The camera is an older Nikon D3100 and the age is starting to show.  My supervisor didn't give me an exact budget range, but told me \"I would suggest avoiding the cheapest option but also don\u2019t think we need top-of-the-line either\". So the budget is a little flexible here.\n\nI'm asking for your help in suggestions of cameras that would fit our needs. What we're looking for is a camera with some of the following traits, listed in order of priority:\n\n1. **Ease of use**. We're looking for something that's easier to \"just pick up and shoot\" with. We realize that no camera makes you a perfect photographer, but whatever you guys think is on the more user-friendly side!\n\n2. **Still photography**. Many of the pictures we take are at events where the subjects can hold a pose, so high quality photos of non-moving subjects would be great.\n\n3. **Low light**. Oftentimes I've found myself in a situation where I struggle to get enough exposure without getting super blurry shots. I'm not quite sure if this is a trait that differs between cameras, but this would be a nice quality to have in our camera.\n\n4. **Moving photography**. I know this one contradicts #2 a little bit but I thought I'd throw it out there. We also like to take pictures of our midshipmen in action, such as PT, close order drill, field exercises, etc. Again, not a must-have but a nice addition.\n\n* We're also looking for some **lenses**! One or two is really all we can afford.\n\nI totally understand that good photography is the product of a *good photographer, not a good camera*. Unfortunately, we rarely have the time to give our midshipmen classes on photography, so we're kind of forced to rely on a good camera. \n\nAny suggestion helps my search! Ironically as the photographer I don't know too much about photography, especially since I'm trying to learn Illustrator and Photoshop at the same time, all on top of my regular workload.

Anybody want to talk me out of one and into another? \n\nI'm looking for weather sealing, affordable lenses, good low light, and relatively fast time between turning on the camera to shooting. I will be using it for travel, street photography, portraits, night sky (when traveling), hiking (mostly taking landscapes and pictures of birds (tele?) and insects (macro)), and using video to document family events and major milestones. I have no aspiration for professional (pro=paid?) photography, however, I do love tinkering with settings and pretending that I am pro - I already have a job that I love so this is a passion driven hobby. I have always loved photography and had an interest in taking artistic shots since I was a kid. My wife and I are renting a convertible to drive Route 66 starting near a friend's house in Oklahoma and ending at the Santa Monica Pier in California. She bought a Rt66 insider book (EZ66) and wants me to take some great pictures while we cross a nice portion of North America. We have discussed that we are planning to stop \"not trying\" to have kids and we both agree that now might be a good time to invest in another camera.  I normally shoot with a Sony RX100mk4 and am looking to get something much *different.* In college I had a canon G10 which I loved but it was stolen from my car's glove box (lock your car kids! - I will never get the photos of those aldabra tortoises back!) forcing me to search for something to fill the void. I ended up finding a kid who wanted to get rid of his mirrorless Olympus Pen EPL1 and its kit lens (I paid a ridiculously low $40 with memory card) which was a great load of fun but I was always too broke to invest in other lenses besides adapters for older lenses I found in the thrift store; things have changed and I'm in more of a position to invest in some glass. I do love my handy RX100mk4 for how powerful it is in such an inconspicuous package; i.e. great for street and museum because most people don't even notice it. It sees better than I do in the dark (fast lens) as long as I don't zoom in. It is perfect for traveling around places where a full size camera isn't too welcome and fits (*barely*) in my pocket when my wife and I are on a date. I love that there is very little delay between turning it on to when I can start shooting - I don't want to miss the chance to capture a moment because my camera is slow to wake up. I also like that it focuses pretty quickly and there is no noticeable delay between depressing the 2nd stop and the RX taking the picture.  The RX100 does have its shortcomings - it has no weather sealing which makes me very anxious - I hiked with it on the Inca trail and cut up a water bottle to make a special shield which clung to my neck strap and slid down over the camera when we were being rained on - this worked but the whole time I was thinking how I wish I had a weather sealed Pentax.  Pixel peeping isn't a good idea with the RX100mk4 as some pictures aren't as crisp as I'd like.   \nI'm interested in a bigger sandbox and looking to get one of the 3 previously mentioned cameras because: 1. First and foremost, I am a baller on a budget. As much as I would like a Sony a7siii, I cannot justify spending more than $500 on a camera body + first lens at this time. 2. I have romanced the idea of a larger sensor. 3. I have romanced the idea of the versatility of lenses. 4. I want the delay between turning on the camera to taking a picture to be reasonably short. 5. I am the kind of guy who likes to take pictures in bad lighting without using a flash. I'm that guy. 6. I want to take this thing outside and it rains a lot in Florida. 7. I tend to hold onto my cameras and expect to keep this thing for a long time. \n\nThe competition:\n\nThe Canon 6D is being offered for $450 with a 50mm lens. Seller says they bought it towards the end of the before-times with 12k actuations and hasn't used it much since. It needs a new eye-cup and the selector knob label is missing (can be replaced).  I like that it has a biiiiiiiig full frame sensor and am curious to learn to use the LCD screen on top of the body while shooting. While the 6D is weather sealed, the weather sealed lenses seem a lot more expensive compared to the Pentax offerings. \n\nI have romanced the idea of Pentax cameras for a while, starting with the K-01 which I always thought had a beautiful design, however, I don't think the K-01 ergonomics fit with what I am looking for. I *am* looking forward to the \"Legendary\" weather sealing and purist photography experience synonymous with Pentax. \n\nThe two Pentax deals I am considering are:\n\nK5ii -Seller is offering body only, but with added battery grip. Great APS-C sensor - \"semi-pro\" tier model. Has a LCD on top. Lots of \"weather sealed\" lenses available at reasonable prices and old manual focus K-mounts available. Supposedly good in low light. Seller offering for $200, so I'd need to spend some $$ to take my first picture. If I get this camera, I can afford a couple of cheap weather sealed e-bay lenses or one nicer lens before I hit the budget of the 6D\n\nKS2 - Seller is offering with a 50mm lens. Claims it has been babied. Looks babied.  It is the newest of the 3. Still weather sealed. Same benefits of lenses as the K5ii. Has some nice features like Wi-Fi. CON: no LCD on top (does anybody even use theirs? Am I focusing too much on this feature?). It looks more like a consumer grade but the specs are pretty nice and of the 3, [cameracompare.com](https://cameracompare.com) is telling me that it is a no-brainer  (whoopie! :P) Seller offering for $360\n\nReddit,  \n\n\nWhich camera do you think I should spring for? Any lens recommendations? Should I snap out of it and just be glad to have a RX100mk4 and spend the money I would have spent on these cameras on a bunch of Big Texan style giant steak challenges instead?  \n\n\nThank you in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/n4fu7g/baller_on_a_budget/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "baller on a budget /!/ hello all,\n\ni'm looking to snag a good deal on a used dslr and i have found what i believe to be three pretty great deals on a used: canon 6d, a pentax k5ii, or pentax ks2. anybody want to talk me out of one and into another? \n\ni'm looking for weather sealing, affordable lenses, good low light, and relatively fast time between turning on the camera to shooting. i will be using it for travel, street photography, portraits, night sky (when traveling), hiking (mostly taking landscapes and pictures of birds (tele?) and insects (macro)), and using video to document family events and major milestones. i have no aspiration for professional (pro=paid?) photography, however, i do love tinkering with settings and pretending that i am pro - i already have a job that i love so this is a passion driven hobby. i have always loved photography and had an interest in taking artistic shots since i was a kid. my wife and i are renting a convertible to drive route 66 starting near a friend's house in oklahoma and ending at the santa monica pier in california. she bought a rt66 insider book (ez66) and wants me to take some great pictures while we cross a nice portion of north america. we have discussed that we are planning to stop \"not trying\" to have kids and we both agree that now might be a good time to invest in another camera.  i normally shoot with a sony rx100mk4 and am looking to get something much *different.* in college i had a canon g10 which i loved but it was stolen from my car's glove box (lock your car kids!
