I apologize for that in advance;\n* This story is very recent (most recent development was 28th of January), relevant because of the sale of Olympus;\n* The camera grip was bought in Canada from Olympus Canada (in April of 2020);\n* The camera body was bought in the Netherlands from an independent camera store (late November 2019).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so here we go:\n\nThe story started in April of 2020, I was in Canada for a few months and I decided to buy an Olympus HLD-8G camera grip for my Olympus OM-D E-M5 II. I bought it directly from Olympus CA (online) and everything was great.\n\nRight up until about August of 2020, by then I was already back in my home country of the Netherlands, when I started noticing that every so often the camera would not stop focusing until I took the picture (it was like the shutter was always half-pressed). Usually after a restart or a reseat of the grip it would be solved. I found it weird but did not think too much of it at that point.\n\nFast forward about a month, maybe six weeks... \n\nI started having the problem more and more up to the point where I'd have it practically every other time I switched the camera on. I tried everything from different (Olympus) lenses, batteries, using the touch screen, not using it... Nothing seemed to fix it. I updated the camera's firmware, the lenses' firmware but nothing worked. \n\nThat's when I contacted Olympus US/CA, asking if I \\*have\\* to send it to CA where I bought it or if I could just have it serviced where I live. This was October 22nd 2020 (keep this date in mind). \n\nGiven the circumstances, I also contacted my local Olympus service centre to see if they would have an answer for me.\n\nThe next day I got a reply from my local Olympus rep asking me to clarify some points, I sent a pretty specific email back saying exactly what my problems were and what I'd tried up until that point to try and fix it. \n\nA couple days later I get a response from the same rep saying that since I bought it in Canada they would possibly not be covered by warranty (even though it's under INTL warranty) but to register it for repair via their online form in the My Olympus dashboard anyway, he said they'll keep me posted before it would mean I'd have to pay for anything. \n\nThe same day I sign it up for repair through the online form (specifying it as an under warranty repair). I sent it out with their shipping label probably about a week later.\n\nA couple days later: the first response from the US/CA service department (mind you, it's already been about 3 weeks since I've sent the first email) stating that I'd have to return it to the CA service centre to have it fixed under any type of warranty. I leave the US/CA contact for what it is and focus on the 'local' rep from this point on.\n\nA few days later I get the notification from Olympus stating that my product has arrived at the service centre (I sent it to a local address, but that was actually not where it went in the end... It ended up in Portugal, over 2000 KM away). \n\n4 Days later, I get the notification that they've tested my grip and that they did not find any defects, requesting that if I wanted my grip tested properly I'd have to also send my camera in with it. They did not tell me how to make sure both repairs would get linked. I asked, it didn't work. I registered my camera as a repair, specifically saying in the notes to link both ticket IDs so that it would end up in the same spot as my grip.\n\nBecause the repair registration process did not let me link the both together I also sent an email asking for the two to be linked. \n\nI sent out my camera in it's original packaging (just like I did with my grip) and got the notification it was received at the service centre a couple days later. \n\nNow: NOTHING for a week. THEN: a notification from the shipping company saying there's a package on it's way back from Olympus (note that I have not received any updates either my request to link both repairs or status-updates for my camera or grip).\n\nA day later: the package arrives, it's my camera body with a note that said they 'cleaned' it and that there was nothing else done. The box reeked of smoke when I got it back, but at least my camera was back.\n\nI sent another email to the same rep as the one I had contact with before saying that I'd gotten my camera back but have not had any other form of contact or updates since (reached out this time December 18th 2020).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTHING FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS: I reach out again asking for an update about my grip, also mentioning that I've been waiting a very long time already with apparently nothing having been done to fix my issues and that if it were to take longer still they'd probably just send me a new one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTHING FOR ANOTHER 2.5 WEEKS: I get a shipping notification a package from Olympus (Portugal) is arriving soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple days later, the package arrives, the original box in worse shape than when I sent it out, the plastic protection that was over the connector pins on the grip missing and the grip badly packed inside the box.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Till this day, I have not had any updates regarding my tickets/repairs since November 23rd!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to get this out there to show how horrible Olympus' service is (or has been to me at least) and if it gets enough attention, what they plan to do with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for the record: I LOVE MY OLYMPUS gear, it's amazing (if it works) and if I'd upgrade it would probably be an Olympus body as well, it's just that the service seems to just be absolutely horrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the ones interested, I'll also add the full contact log below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContact log Olympus:\n\n22 october 2020, first contact with Olympus about whether to send it to CA or keep it in NL, sending to US/CA contact (Me)\n\n23 october 2020, first answer from Olympus asking me what the question actually is (Olympus)\n\n23 october 2020, responding with elaborate explanation (Me)\n\n26 october 2020, response that the grip bought in CA has intl warranty meaning that I'd likely have to pay for the repair and to sign it up for repair anyway (Olympus)\n\n26 october 2020, I sign it up for repair via the website (specifying repair under warranty) (Me)\n\n12 november 2020, response from \\*FIRST CONTACT\\*(22 october), saying that I'll have to return it to the country of origin to have any type of warranty (Olympus US/CA)\n\n16 november 2020, product arrived at Olympus service centre (Olympus)\n\n20 november 2020, product tested, no defect found.
