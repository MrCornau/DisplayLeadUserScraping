What Should I get? /!/ tl;dr: I haven't had a new camera in almost 10 years, suggest me new ones (preferably point-and-shoot) less than $700 that would be good for nature photography, everyday situations, and travel.\n\nHello, all! First of all, I want to say thank you in advance to anyone who decides to help me in my quest to find a new camera. Any and all advice is appreciated!  \n\n\nAlso, this might be a long post, so bear with me. There is a tl;dr at the top, but I hope you read the full post anyway.   \n\n\nSo, like the title says, I haven't gotten a new camera in almost 10 years. I have a Nikon D60 that I got my sophomore year of high school and I have a Nikon S8200 point-and-shoot that I got in 2011, maybe? Anyway, they have always worked really well for me and I love them dearly, but I really need an upgrade. 10 years is a long time and there have been so many advances that I just want to try something new, even if there is nothing necessarily wrong with my current cameras. I am on a budget, though, so I'm really only looking to upgrade my point-and-shoot for now and the DSLR a little later down the line. I use my current cameras primarily for nature shots (so I need a good zoom and depth of field), everyday situations, travel, and daily outfit/blog post photos.  \n\n\nHere is what I am looking for:\n\n* something compact, preferably a point-and-shoot (I will upgrade my DLSR down the line)\n* a flip-out display (I take a lot of OOTD and blog photos)\n* built in Wi-Fi, NSF, bluetooth (GPS tags cool, but not necessary)\n* great zoom capability\n* takes quality photos in low-light situations\n* image stabalization\n* tripod mount (do they make cameras that *don't* have these anymore?)\n* high quality, high resolution images\n* macro mode (other built in effects a plus)\n* burst mode, panorama mode\n* manual and auto controls\n* viewfinder preferred (not totally necessary)\n* full HD video (4K not necessary)\n* any brand (I am partial to Nikon since it's all I've ever had, but I can branch out)\n\nI am willing to spend up to $700 on a new camera, if that helps narrow down suggestions. I have been doing some research, but there are so many options and it gets overwhelming! I haven't narrowed it down to anything yet, but some cameras that keep popping up are the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II (although, most of the reviews I've seen of it are from vloggers, not photographers), the Richor GR II (although the lower megapixels make me wary), and the Nikon CoolPix A900 (but it doesn't seem to have that great of reviews on Amazon).   \n\n\nAnyway, my thoughts are all over the place, so I came here seeking outside advice. Do you know of any cameras in that price range that fit my requirements? What cameras do you use? Any suggestions would be helpful (even if you say I'm being too picky or crazy because it's hard to find a camera in that price range with all those elements (because I know it is)).

I think my cheapest is a Samsung NX1 currently. Haven't had a cheaper camera in 10 years now.\n\nI honestly did a good bit of research and think a Sony a6000 is the best choice, but I want some input form other camera people first on my two uses.\n\nFirst off I need something that is mirrorless (I actually want it to be mirrorless as I only own 2 out of my 11 cameras) but is also easier to use and feels more full featured and expandable (removable lens for example). So when I go on trips and have a tag along with no camera they can still feel like what they are shooting on is nice. I had an accident with a Hasselblad and refuse to let anyone touch my expensive stuff.\n\n\nSecond, I need clean hdmi out (no menus on hdmi output). As well as 1920x1080 60p output from the hdmi that I can use a laptop capture card with, to turn the camera into a super overpriced webcam of sorts. 4-6 times a year I do events like museum categorizing, portraits for workforce, and documenting. We currently use a Logitech Brio 2160p webcam, but the alternating framerate and inline software suck as well as overall quality even in outstanding lighting. Side note, The camera could potentially be doing this hdmi out to a capture card for 6-8 hours for days or weeks in a row, and in some cases 12+ hours for days in a row. Could this be bad for a mirrorless camera, like burn in on sensor and such? \n\n\nI have considered something like a Sony CX405 Handycam for my second task, but their quality seems lacking, and then I am buying two products for two tasks, when I really want to do one product for two tasks.\n\nI really think the a6000 is the best choice used.
