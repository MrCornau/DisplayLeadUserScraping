I've been wanting to get a video camera for awhile now. I had been planning to use it for a couple tasks,  such as documenting personal projects, instructional videos, maybe making a youtube video or two, etc. I decided I liked the camcorder form factor better than that of the DSLR because easy single-hand operation and the ability to position the screen to be front facing (or other directions, like if filming a top-down view of something, for instance) seemed appealing. After a bit of research, I had settled on the [Canon Vixia HF R800](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7OAH3I/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=A1BOQWC2XF5W4I&amp;psc=1). \n\nSo I had been saving up the money for this, and was getting ready to pull the trigger, but then my terrible, infuriating, piece of garbage cellphone finally gave up the ghost.
