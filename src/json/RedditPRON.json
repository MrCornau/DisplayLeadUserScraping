The abbreviation \u201cACCESS\u201d stands for \u201cAutomated Community Connection to Economic Self Sufficiency.\u201d In other words, the ACCESS program is designed to provide assistance to those in need.\n\nMany people associate ACCESS only with food assistance, but there are actually several branches of the ACCESS Florida program. Here is a brief description of the services offered as part of ACCESS.\n\nFood Assistance\n\nOne large part of the ACCESS program is food assistance. There are two forms of food assistance offered. The basic assistance is there to help anyone in the state of Florida who is on a low income and needs help buying healthy food to feed themselves and the people that they live with, which is usually immediate family such as their children.\n\nBasic food assistance is provided for a period of between three months and three years, depending on how much help an individual or family needs. The length and amount of the benefits will be determined by the household income and expenses, as well as a few other factors.\n\nThe second part of the ACCESS Florida food assistance program is called SUNCAP. It was created specifically to assist Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. However, those on SSI may actually be eligible for both food programs and may choose to only receive basic assistance, rather than receiving SUNCAP benefits.\n\nMonetary Assistance\n\nAnother part of ACCESS Florida is the monetary assistance program. Known as Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA), it is there to help families with minor children and women who are in the late stages of pregnancy. Those who are eligible can get monthly cash assistance, which is meant to benefit the children and allow them to stay with their families.\n\nIn some cases, a court order may place a child with a relative. The relative will then be eligible to receive cash assistance through the TCA Relative Caregiver Program. However, their own income will not be counted when determining benefits. They will simply be given a certain amount based on the age of the child in question. Eligible children must live in Florida, have less than $2,000 in assets, and meet other eligibility requirements in order for their relative caregiver to receive assistance.\n\nMedical Assistance\n\nACCESS Florida also provides medical assistance in the form of Medicaid benefits for those who qualify. Those who are part of the TCA program can also receive Medicaid. Even those who are not receiving benefits through TCA may qualify.\n\nMedicaid benefits can be given to a variety of individuals for different reasons. Some people who may qualify include:\n\n  - Pregnant Women\n  - Low-Income Families\n  - Children in Low-Income Households\n  - Disabled People\n  - Elderly People\n\nSo, if you or your family are in need of assistance, ACCESS Florida may be able to help.

I have recently updated my computer set up and decided it was time to get a professional spec monitor to really step up my abilities. \n\n**TL;DR** Color Gamut and Bit Depth are probably the most important for some photographers, understand your output and that will dictate your requirements! Online only really means sRGB and 8bit, Online + Printing you'll need AdobeRGB and 10bit. Resolution is up to you\n\nI had a pretty strict budget and reasonable expectations (I didn\u2019t want to spend $4,000+ on an Eizo or Pro Display XDR) and wanted to spend that money as reasonably as possible. My needs were decent resolution, a wide color gamut, and a large display surface. I am printing more of my photos and find myself being disappointed that I don\u2019t produce what my screen shows. For reference I am coming from a 2011 iMac and 2012 MacBook Pro Retina. \n\n*Note: This is not a review of a monitor or a personal recommendation, this is a synopsis of the information I learned when trying to make my own decision.* \n\n**Color Gamut**: This was the most important thing I found to improve my photography. A lot of research was done on my part into the science of color, which is a post for another day. \n\nMy decision was between two color gamut capabilities, sRGB and AdobeRGB. Most monitors you can purchase today are capable of sRGB. More professional oriented monitors expand the gamut capabilities to AdobeRGB. AdobeRGB is a larger color gamut than sRGB, it was created to encompass the color gamut of CMYK printers to more accurately represent the colors captured. Using sRGB for printing can leave colors out, for example you lose some green and cyan output ability if you print a photo in sRGB. Because of this I wanted a monitor that was capable of displaying the AdobeRGB gamut to accurately depict what my printer is capable of and therefore when I edit a photograph I will be editing within the capabilities of my printer and not my monitor. The below image shows the AdobeRGB gamut, sRGB, and a CMYK generic gamut. Notice that the CMYK is capable of showing more shades than sRGB, so capturing in sRGB and printing means you are not getting the fully \"picture.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AbodeRGB, CMYK, and sRGB gamuts mapped on the CIE 1931 Chromaticity plot \\(original source unknown\\)](https://preview.redd.it/iqltitn7ndk41.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f34fba0e5720e9caf002bb41c19ecfbc2b12918)\n\nIf however you consume and output your photographs digitally and find your prints to be acceptable (if you even care about printing) than an sRGB monitor will be perfect and will not break the bank. A huge number of monitors exist that can display 100% of sRGB that are very inexpensive.\n\nIf you are like me and want to be able to see all of the colors your outputs are capable of (you can set most AdobeRGB monitors to display sRGB for digital editing) then you should be looking for not just a wide gamut monitor, but one capable of 95% or more of the AdobeRGB gamut. \n\n**Bit Depth**: There is A LOT of confusion about Bit Depth on monitors. There are three options generally out there for people who are advanced photographers, but maybe not a studio professional using a medium format camera. 8 Bit, \u201c10 Bit\u201d, and 10 Bit. The bit depth determines how many shades of one of the components of the display (Red, Green, Blue) can do from 100% brightness to 0%. 8 bit divides each color into 256 discrete values of brightness. Combining these 256 levels of Red, Green, and Blue leads to 16,777,216 \u201ccolors.\u201d \n\n*Note: This is something that is in contention, the meaning of number of colors, I prescribe to the notion that it is 16.7 million discrete color values, which is the more technical definition and more accurate.*\n\nThere are two versions of 10 bit, true 10 bit and \u201c10 bit\u201d, otherwise known as 8 bit + FRC (Frame Rate Control). 10 bit depth means the device is capable of displaying 1,073,741,824 shades of color (in whatever gamut you have). \n\nFRC is a fancy trick monitors play with the frame rate of each pixel and surrounding pixels, effectively creating 4 shades (100%,75%, etc) behind the 256 shades of each pixel component (bringing the total to 1024 shades for each component). Some people have no issues with this, since technically the human eye can only perceive around 16 million shades of color, so 8 bit is all we can perceive. The issue however is when the color gamut gets larger. That means the Red, Green, and Blue components are further away from each other. If we send the signal to show shade 200 Green and 201 Green we can barely perceive the difference on an sRGB display, but since AdobeRGB has expanded into the Green region more, the difference between shade 200 and 201 of Green is larger, exacerbating the difference in shades. When comparing 8 bit to 10 bit, 1 shade in 8 bit color could be 4 different shades in 10 bit.\n\nUsing 10bit color then allows a more precise representation of colors with a finer resolution. Gradients will be smoother, which is the biggest benefit. Posterization will not be visible. In my situation having AdobeRGB required me to have a 10 bit capable monitor to avoid posterization. \n\n***ACHTUNG****: 10 bit displays need 10 bit output from your graphics card. Check your machines capabilities before purchasing a 10 bit monitor, unless you are future-proofing your setup. For your information, the MacBook Pro 16\" is capable of outputting 10 bit color on DisplayPort 1.4 (through the Thunderbolt Alt Mode).*\n\n**Resolution**: This is purely a personal preference in general. If you want 4K, then go for it. There are tons of 4K monitors on the market with sRGB coverage, there are fewer when you are looking for 4K and AdobeRGB. And then they start to get somewhat expensive. \n\nIn my search I worried over whether I needed 4K since so many screens have very large PPI (pixels per inch) and have some incredible perceived sharpness. There are arguments for and against these large resolution monitors. Some photographers prefer 1440p (2560x1440) on 27\u201d screens as this allows then to view photos at 100%, which effectively would make them larger than on a 4K monitor. In addition some find it easier to judge critical focus on these 108 PPI screens (as opposed to &gt;150PPI on a 4K screen). That being said, if you want a 32\u201d monitor then a 4K resolution is very acceptable. \n\nAgain, resolution is a personal preference. I got over the worries that I NEEDED 4K, it opened up a lot more possibilities for monitors with AdobeRGB gamuts.\n\n**Size**: Again personal preference, I chose a 27\u201d monitor. I felt 32\u201d was excessive at the distance I would view it at, and found myself turning my head to view things at the edge of display. \n\nI think Resolution and Screen Size are something that should go hand in hand, shoot for a minimum of 108PPI. Balance your wants with your budget.\n\nMy Choice: I chose the BenQ SW270C. It is AdobeRGB 99% coverage, 1440p, 27\u201d, and 10 bit capable. In addition it has USB-C connections making it easy for me to connect to. A nifty inclusion, which comes with a number of Professional grade monitors, is the monitor hood. It really cuts the side glare I get from the windows in my studio area and makes the screen really pop. I recommend that you consider all of your needs and how you shoot and distribute your photos.\n\nIn my opinion there are two true requirements that need to be balanced: Color Gamut-Bit Depth and Resolution-Size. This wasn\u2019t very obvious to me at first, but these are things that should go hand in hand. Wider gamuts should have higher bit depths, and larger screens need larger resolutions (of course this is more of a personal preference)\n\nThere is nothing wrong with shooting and displaying in sRGB, really an AdobeRGB monitor is only going to be useful for some photographers. \n\nA Few Notes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Color Gamut: There are hundreds of publications that explain the science of color. I recommend doing some research if you enjoy linear algebra and the science of human perception. However, the point I want to make is that if you set your camera to auto and leave it in JPEG you are probably capturing things in sRGB. Unless your camera is capable of capturing RAW or AdobeRGB and high color bit depth, a AdobeRGB monitor is not going to be very useful for you. Save your money and invest it in a RAW capable camera or some more education if you want to get into that level of photography. \n2. Color Calibration: Out of the box most monitors are great, including the professional ones. However, calibration of a monitor can improve the performance and is necessary when you start printing fine art. Calibrating your monitor and your printer will make the outputs between the monitor and printer match more closely, making it much easier to edit your photos and get a great print sooner. If you plan on calibrating it is a good idea to find a monitor that allows for \"Hardware Calibration.\" This is calibrating the internal Look Up Tables (LUTs) of the monitor that allows for better and more accurate processing of the input signal from the computer (10bit to 16bit to 10bit). The LUTs allow the display to **accurately** display the colors from the computer. Each monitor does not have a linear response to each component, so increasing the depth to 16bit during the translation means that the output will be better matched to the displays capabilities.", "title": "Choosing a Monitor for Photographic Editing", "num-comments": 37, "score": 1, "date": "2020-03-03 03:33:11", "content": "Choosing a Monitor for Photographic Editing /!/ I spent a lot of time researching and studying monitor specs, color science, and photographic capabilities to try and decide what the best monitor for my needs would be.

Normally, you can do this easily with an astronomical simulator. However, this particular event needs something more complicated than that. ***I want to know how atmospheric refraction and air turbulence and changing contrast between the sky and the stars changes the view for a naked-eye astronomer.*** The BENEFITS of modern astronomy, telescopes, awesome layered images, long exposures, etc. is a WEAKNESS when it comes to trying to recreate what I'm doing. \n\nIn short, I need help on how to take a picture that EXACTLY MATCHES (as close as humanly possible) what an ordinary human eye sees. I will take ANY help I can get. \n\n**The Reason for the Experiment**\n\nI\u2019ll just get to the core of the matter, but please don't stop reading because you think I am a kook. I know how crazy this sounds, but it is what it is. Using an ordinary astronomical simulator, some historical research, and re-translating ancient manuscripts from their original languages, I found the astronomical event that is \u201cthe Star of Bethlehem\u201d in the Bible. Yeah, yeah... I know how crazy that sounds. But stay with me here until the end of this post. \n\n**The Background Research Done So Far**\n\nBack in 1968, Roger Sinnott published a famous article in Sky and Telescope magazine in which he identified two conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus on August 12 3BC and June 17 2 BC. He thought they could be related to the Star of Bethlehem. he first had the planets 12 arc minutes apart. The second had the planets 3 arc minutes apart. Sinnott concludes that this second conjunction (due to atmospheric refraction) would have looked like a single point of light in the sky. I had to get a copy of this article from the Library of Congress because there are no internet archives of Sky and Telescope available (even emailed the editors, no luck). But I got it.\n\nWith that copy, I looked up his footnotes and found that Sinnott did this measurement using Bryant Tuckerman\u2019s \u201c[Planetary, Lunar and Solar Positions 601 B.C. to A.D. 1 at 5-Day and 10-Day Intervals,](https://books.google.com/books/about/Planetary_Lunar_and_Solar_Positions_601.html?id=ByEtNvXnv4QC)\u201d from the 1960s to make these measurements. It was calculated using [an IBM 704 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704). (A dinosaur). As a result, the accuracy of the measurements is atrocious, even though the work of Sinnott is admirable.\n\nHowever, technology has advanced. If you use [VSOP87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_(planets)) (which is basically standard and super-accurate for the past few thousand years), we find that the distances of Jupiter and Venus are way closer than Sinnott believed. Rather than 3 arc minutes, on June 17, 2 BC, the distance was on 30 arc SECONDS apart (from the location of Bethlehem). From some places on earth, this event was a mutual planetary occultation. This has been noted before in books like Ernest Martin\u2019s \u201cThe Star of Bethlehem: The Star that Astonished the World.\u201d\n\nWhat I have found through my own research is that basically NOBODY pays attention to the earlier conjunction of August 12 3 BC, where the planets were in the eastern sky, about 30 degrees of separation from the Sun, visible between 3:45am and 5:20am (when the sun rose). From a viewing location of Baghdad, their distance was not 12 arc minutes, but instead ranged from 11 arc minutes to 9 arc minutes. **I believe there is something MAJOR here that is overlooked.** \n\nAs Evidence for this, I give you a few of my findings. There is a fun [paper published by an ophthalmologist](https://www.academia.edu/4982885/An_Ancient_Eye_Test_Using_the_Stars_GM_Bohigian_Surv_Ophth_08_53_5_) that tries to compare view of the stars with our modern way of measuring eye-sight. He found that two stars placed 12 arc minutes apart cannot be differentiated if one's vision is 20/30. That's a measure of visual \"acuity.\" Additionally, some people who were older in his experiment couldn't even tell the two stars apart, even though their visual \"acuity\" is 20/20, because other factors such as contrast sensitivity may come into play.  \n\nAs it relates to what naked-eye astronomers see and record, I have found evidence that pre-telescope naked eye astronomers saw conjunctions that were 7 arc minutes apart AT NIGHT (with perfect contrast) as \"shining without visible space between them.\" (See this [paper written by Salvo de Meis](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993JBAA..103..185D)). Because of this, I think it is possible to demonstrate that the same happened to Jupiter and Venus, which were a distance of 9 arc minutes apart in the rising dawn of the Sun. \n\nThis gives the following understanding of the \"Star of Bethelehm\" that the Magi saw. \"The Star\" is the combined light of Jupiter and Venus. It is true that no astronomical body, either real or hypothetical has been able to be matched to the strange motion that we see described in [Matthew 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2&amp;version=KJV): (\"we have seen his star in the east \" and \"lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.\") But the CONJUNCTION OF JUPITER AND VENUS INTO A SINGLE POINT OF LIGHT actually DOES fit! It's rather simple, really. \"The Star\" was seen on August 12, 3BC. Then it disappeared, and Jupiter and Venus \"went before them\" on their ordinary paths in the sky. Then, on June 17, 2 BC, \"the star\" that they had seen in the East ARRIVED back in a second conjunction. Then, it fell to the western horizon (because that's what all stars do) over a particular place from the perspective of a naked-eye observer of the stars. That perfectly fits what is described in Matthew 2, just not in the way we modern readers typically think of it. \n\nBut there is work to be done, especially on that first conjunction that was between 11 and 9 arc minutes apart. I need to PROVE that it would have been seen as a SINGLE point of light in the sky. Here's the photographic experiment I want to do, but I need some feedback from people with good photography knowledge to know where it falls short. \n\n**The Opportunity for the Experiment**\n\nWe have an upcoming event: On December 22, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn will have a conjunction in the Western sky. They will be about 30 degrees from the Sun (Just like the August 12, 3 BC conjunction was). \n\nThis means we can almost RECREATE the August 12 3 BC conjunction that Sinnott first identified! What we need to do is record it (by taking a photograph of it) in a way that PRESERVES what a NAKED EYE OBSERVER would have seen. In other words: \"No filter.\" No \"image magnification.\" No \"layered images.\" None of these \"look at this comet neowise looks!\" photo lies. (Impressive and beautiful photography, but not at all accurate).  \n\n**The Plan for the Experiment**\n\nThis is how I propose to do it. I think we need a group of photographers at various locations on earth. (The West Coast is actually a good observations spot from what I have seen on my simulator). They need to use one of those star-tracker mounts to get a steady camera view. They need to use a 50mm camera lens (because as far as I know, that mimics the human eye). The photograph should include some object at a fixed distance from the camera to preserve the right SCALE of the final printed picture (because even if you don't zoom, if you print it out 5 times the size, that still causes the same problem). We would need to take ORDINARY pictures (no image stacking, but I admit, this is where my knowledge is most limited). We should do it throughout the evening on December 22, 2020, until the conjunction is no longer visible. The pictures should have a time-stamp. Using that time stamp, we will have a series of pictures that show what a naked-eye observer would see (with atmospheric turbulance and all) over time. This recrates ONE HALF of the conjunction: The planet Jupiter at 30 degrees of separation from the Sun. \n\nSaturn is not as bright as Venus, but what Saturn CAN do is serve as the \"place holder\" for where Venus WILL GO when Venus also achieves an evening distance from the Sun of 30 degrees. The second part of the experiment is to wait until Venus reaches the same angular separation from the Sun. We repeat the experiment and get the data together. Then, using the location of Saturn as our place-marker, we use whatever photoshop wizardry we need to replace the light-output of Saturn with the accurate light-output of Venus. (This will happen sometime next year). \n\n**The Help I Need**\n\nIf I do a crowd-source experiment of astro-photographers, I need to know WHAT INFORMATION I SHOULD GET FROM THESE OBSERVERS. I need to produce a standard fill-in-the-blank form for them. I know I need to know the Camera (so we know the sensor), the lens (so we know the effect on the image). I know we will need the observing location (city or lat and long). I know we will need some information on the weather (Humidity, barometric pressure, and after that, I have no idea). \n\nIf anyone can help me standardize how to get that \"scale\" measurement in the photo, I would greatly appreciate it. The concept is something I understand, but the execution is not. I would need to be able to explain it to my helpers. \n\nWhen this is done, we will be able to recreate what the August 12, 3 BC conjunction looked like throughout that morning by reverse-engineering these observations of the Jupiter and Saturn conjunction and the Venus photographs. \n\nThat's the basic concept of the experiment, but I need some help from people who are much better at photography than me to take these pictures and who are more skilled in the optics to know how to render an accurate \u201creal-life\u201d view in a picture.\n\nPlease PLEASE give me any feedback you have on this idea. Additionally, PM me if you would like to help.\n\n**Proof That This Is Worth Your Time and That I'm not Crazy**  \nI know that people who usually claim that they've found the Star of Bethlehem are a little bit crazy and their theories are less-than-compelling. You might be wondering why I'm asking this on Reddit and not somewhere \"credentialed.\" The real reason is that astronomy and history are hobbies of mine, and I don't have credentials. I am a lawyer. Academic journals do not listen to me or even read my papers (trust me, I've tried). I need to be so rock-solid on my findings that there are no ways to deny it.\n\nUnfortunately, Reddit is the only place where people are as \"into\" their hobbies as I am. \n\nBut beyond that, I'm going to let you look into what I've found yourself. I'm going to reveal some of my research and link to the underlying sources.  \n\nAs you know, my theory is that \"the star\" of Bethlehem is a pair of close conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus. That's a nice and coherent theory, but how can I PROVE it? Well, I think I can.\n\nThe Roman Historian Tacitus in his Histories [at Book 5 Chapter 13](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.5.v.html) is talking about the Jewish Revolt in 70 AD, which was put down by Vespasian. As context for this revolt, he lists a bunch of \u201cprodigies\u201d or \"omens\" that were observed beforehand. These were the basis of a belief in the East (that is, the Parthian Empire) that \u201crulers, coming from Judaea, were to acquire universal empire\u201d or (as [recorded by Suetonius](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html)) \"men coming from Judaea \\[would\\] rule the world.\" Initially, I wondered where such a prodigy in \"the East\" (not Judaea, but \"the East\") would have come from. I became suspicious that it might be the Star of Bethlehem when I realized that \"the East\" is the same place the Magi were from and where they returned. \n\nHowever, I went back and looked at the document in its original Latin. The FIRST of these omens listed by Tacitus is translated into English as \"There had been seen hosts joining battle in the skies,\" which [in Latin is \"visae per caelum concurrere acies.\"](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.hist5.shtml) This translation seems to be made to agree with Josephus (Described in[Jewish Wars, Book 5, Chapter 5](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm)), who described another strange \"prodigy\" that occurred around this time: \n\n&gt; on the one and twentieth day of the month Artemisius, \\[Jyar,\\] a certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared: I suppose the account of it would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities \n\nHowever, I think this is a wrong translation. While the Latin word \"acies\" can be translated as \"an army drawn up for battle,\" it is not so clear that Josephus and Tacitus are reporting the same thing. What I came to find is that \"acies\" [really means is \"sharpness\" or \"sharp tool\" (think of swords drawn), or \"points\" or \"pupil of the eye,\" and even, in a metaphorical sense: BRIGHTNESS (think of swords on a ling of battle gleaming in the sunlight)](https://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/acies). This is why it is paired with \"armies\" or \"hosts\" in a way that is not natural to English speakers with bombs for war, instead of blades. Check that link to the Latin dictionary entry if you don't believe me. \n\nSo there is a different way to translate it. This means the \"prodigy\" that is related to the belief that \"men coming from Judaea would rule the world\" was described as **\"\\[visae\\] was seen \\[per\\] in \\[caelum\\] the sky \\[concurrere\\] running together \\[acies\\] POINTS.\"** \n\nWhen you actually observe the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus on August 12, 3 BC and June 17 2 BC in an astronomical simulator, you can see that this description matech PERFECTLY to this event, which moves just like the gospel of Matthew describes. This is a description in a non-Biblical 1st century text of the actual Star of Bethlehem, connecting it to a conjunction of two \"points\" in the sky: the planets Jupiter and Venus. \n\n**CONCLUSION** \n\nIf you can help me with this experiment that MUST be run on December 22, 2020, I can actually PROVE my point about the optics using science. \n\nIf you have expertise in these camera optics and photography skills, please comment below to help me out on how I should construct this. \n\nAnyone who would like to participate and make this happen, I'll even put you you on the academic paper I hope to publish if we can agree on the amount of work and stuff.

You might be wondering why I'm asking this on Reddit and not somewhere \"credentialed.\" The real reason is that astronomy and history are hobbies of mine, and I don't have credentials. I am a lawyer. Academic journals do not listen to me or even read my papers (trust me, I've tried). I need to be so rock-solid on my findings that there are no ways to deny it.\n\nUnfortunately, Reddit is the only place where people are as \"into\" their hobbies as I am. \n\nBut beyond that, I'm going to let you look into what I've found yourself. I'm going to reveal some of my research and link to the underlying sources.  \n\nAs you know, my theory is that \"the star\" of Bethlehem is a pair of close conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus. That's a nice and coherent theory, but how can I PROVE it? Well, I think I can.\n\nThe Roman Historian Tacitus in his Histories [at Book 5 Chapter 13](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.5.v.html) is talking about the Jewish Revolt in 70 AD, which was put down by Vespasian. As context for this revolt, he lists a bunch of \u201cprodigies\u201d or \"omens\" that were observed beforehand. These were the basis of a belief in the East (that is, the Parthian Empire) that \u201crulers, coming from Judaea, were to acquire universal empire\u201d or (as [recorded by Suetonius](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html)) \"men coming from Judaea \\[would\\] rule the world.\" Initially, I wondered where such a prodigy in \"the East\" (not Judaea, but \"the East\") would have come from. I became suspicious that it might be the Star of Bethlehem when I realized that \"the East\" is the same place the Magi were from and where they returned. \n\nHowever, I went back and looked at the document in its original Latin. The FIRST of these omens listed by Tacitus is translated into English as \"There had been seen hosts joining battle in the skies,\" which [in Latin is \"visae per caelum concurrere acies.\"](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.hist5.shtml) This translation seems to be made to agree with Josephus (Described in[Jewish Wars, Book 5, Chapter 5](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm)), who described another strange \"prodigy\" that occurred around this time: \n\n&gt; on the one and twentieth day of the month Artemisius, \\[Jyar,\\] a certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared: I suppose the account of it would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities \n\nHowever, I think this is a wrong translation. While the Latin word \"acies\" can be translated as \"an army drawn up for battle,\" it is not so clear that Josephus and Tacitus are reporting the same thing. What I came to find is that \"acies\" [really means is \"sharpness\" or \"sharp tool\" (think of swords drawn), or \"points\" or \"pupil of the eye,\" and even, in a metaphorical sense: BRIGHTNESS (think of swords on a ling of battle gleaming in the sunlight)](https://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/acies). This is why it is paired with \"armies\" or \"hosts\" in a way that is not natural to English speakers with bombs for war, instead of blades. Check that link to the Latin dictionary entry if you don't believe me. \n\nSo there is a different way to translate it. This means the \"prodigy\" that is related to the belief that \"men coming from Judaea would rule the world\" was described as **\"\\[visae\\] was seen \\[per\\] in \\[caelum\\] the sky \\[concurrere\\] running together \\[acies\\] POINTS.\"** \n\nWhen you actually observe the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus on August 12, 3 BC and June 17 2 BC in an astronomical simulator, you can see that this description matech PERFECTLY to this event, which moves just like the gospel of Matthew describes. This is a description in a non-Biblical 1st century text of the actual Star of Bethlehem, connecting it to a conjunction of two \"points\" in the sky: the planets Jupiter and Venus. \n\n**CONCLUSION** \n\nIf you can help me with this experiment that MUST be run on December 22, 2020, I can actually PROVE my point about the optics using science. \n\nIf you have expertise in these camera optics and photography skills, please comment below to help me out on how I should construct this. \n\nAnyone who would like to participate and make this happen, I'll even put you you on the academic paper I hope to publish if we can agree on the amount of work and stuff.

It's raining here for weeks already with not the greatest conditions for landscape photography, so I took out my macro lens to photograph some mushrooms in the forest. The great thing about this is that you can do this with any kind of light at any moment of the day. \n\nThe mushrooms are (in NL at least) literally everywhere and you can find them especially on wet trees that fell down in forests. Now this was actually the first time I went out to photograph these mushrooms, and I immediately got addicted! So I can recommend this to anyone who loves this style of photography :) I planned to only go to the forest for about an hour, but I stayed the whole day with so much muscle pain as a result (had to lower myself all the time to shoot the tiny mushrooms on the forest floor). Here are some images and tips that I came up with:\n\n\\- Get very low. The prettiest mushrooms are often the tiniest. Sometimes you don't even see them immediately. They can be on fallen trees or directly on the forest floor. You don't want to photograph them at an angle, but from the same height as were they are. So get low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbo1fxui4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21a086012729652e7fe83751e70474ca3317f62\n\n\\- The background is more important than the subject. This was what I found most important when photographing these little guys. By moving the camera just a few mm, the composition and background completely changes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9rnctrk4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b49009e4eecb73797a1d55a32ce40f0d4809f0\n\n\\- Use foreground bokeh. By getting low with your camera and having some leaves or grass in front of your lens, you'll have both dreamy foreground blur AND background blur. You can also use red leaves and put them in front of your lens a bit to create that autumn feeling. This way you create more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A red leaf in the foreground gives that extra depth](https://preview.redd.it/zrrqu95m4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17929506f305565f15a1af58b566d4551b48629)\n\n\\- Use a macro lens or extension tubes. All of these images were made with a 90mm macro. Its my favourite focal length to shoot these kind of shots. You can also get extension tubes for your lens to be able to focus closer to do macro shots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12z39wnw4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0b0a90465b4661cb4cb60371470623978330d73\n\n\\- Use a wide open aperture for extremely dreamy look. I almost always use my macro lens wide open at f/2.8. This way the depth of field is very tiny, and it allows me to create these very dreamy shots.\n\n\\- Find single little mushrooms. There are often big packs of mushrooms that can be very tempting to photograph. But the most beautiful ones are often the very tiny single ones. Because you can make beautiful framing of a single little mushroom with the dreamy background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbieldxr4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fdf83ece48b63473a558e37a38e4bd81322ec9\n\n\\- Photograph them slightly from below so you can see the texture inside. This is something I only noticed later. As a newbie mushroom photographer, I had to 'learn' that they looked so beautiful from the inside. They're often very tiny and low on the ground, so getting below them can be tricky. It gets easier when they're on a tree. By getting lower and photographing them from below, you'll see the beautiful textures in the mushrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj76n8rt4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0558aaa8cf5f7ba5bf9cd0e2798909c1a842ea\n\n\\- A flip screen is super handy. If you don't have a flip screen you basically need to lie on the ground to see what you're doing. I was able to take all these shots by crouching down and looking at my flip screen. Makes things a little bit easier\n\n\\- Use hand held. Some people might disagree with this tip. But I shot all of these images hand held. By using the camera hand held I was able to very quickly switch up my angles and composition. Focusing is HARD though, and the forest is often dark. So most of these images are taken at ISO 400-500. If you're shooting on a tripod, you'll want to shoot with your center column upside down so that you can place your camera very low to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlujc4cv4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2c06612f84b268ba5a9fecd366125c80d440a6\n\n\\- Bring something to sit on. Now as I was saying, I crouched for almost all of these shots. As a result of hours doing this, I have so much muscle pain today :D Next time I'll bring a cloth to sit on, it makes things so much easier!\n\nNow I don't consider myself a pro at macro photography, so feel free to give me any tips as well :) I really enjoyed photographing these mushrooms and it's almost like an entire new tiny world. I'll go back soon to shoot more. You can find more of my work on my [website](https://www.albertdros.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/albertdrosphotography).

I've never tried Saal Digital before and having tried a different bunch of other print houses,\u00a0I decided to give Saal Digital a try. I printed 130 pages 12x8.5 photo book from the professional line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0ba8hnrde561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07b11fc99019899aba90a1cfef75105542f45363\n\n# Design\n\nThere are different choices of formats, surface finish, page thickness, and even a gift box that wraps your book. I chose the Professional Line photobook with the black leather cover surface and went for the glossy finish.\n\nSaal Digital offers layout design software for both Mac OS and Windows where you can customize your book. This is the tool that I used to design, upload, and order my book. You can design your book with other software and upload it for printing as a PDF.\n\nI found the software to be very easy to use. You start out by designing the cover of the book including the back and the spine. Then you start adding pages where you can either choose a layout from existing presets or design your own (and save it if you want).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1ej6gsude561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178c6c35bead5c9a0b6f6892327dcf2e0039b592\n\nAs for the paper itself, Saal Digital [uses](https://www.saal-digital.com/support/article/overview-of-paper-density/) Fuji Crystal Archive paper. For each page, two papers will be glued back to back with a thickness of about 0.36mm per page. I personally love this paper and use it in my darkroom printing since it's widely available in sheets. It has beautiful color rendering with deep blacks and beautiful highlights.\n\nAs for color management, Saal Digital provides ICC color profiles that you can download and load into your image editing software to get a feeling of how the printed photos would look like. I found that the profile rendering stays very close to the exported sRGB JPEGs and the final print. You would get an accurate representation if your monitor is calibrated.\n\nAnother aspect that I liked is what Saal Digital calls \"Layflat Binding\" where you can print panorama on two pages and they would look (hopefully) flat. I've tried this with full two pages layout and over one page layout and they do look flat, however, one concern is to have a white line (eventually) in the binding area, but only time can tell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/211nol3zde561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a5225948192e483e48ad8a247cd60b8aefc09a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0ebe0nxde561.jpg?width=3792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175224f939c6e5181010f1d545f357fdfbf32048\n\n# Print Quality\n\nIt all comes down to print quality when I want to pick which print house to print my photos. Sure, easy tooling and process is a plus but the main factor is how good these prints look and how good the book overall look. Personally, I was impressed with Saal's final book and I'll break it down for you.\n\nAs for the cover, the leather cover felt premium and not cheap. It\u00a0has a non-noticeable nice smell. The binding of the book looks sturdy and shouldn't fall apart with careful use (only time will tell though). The spine looks fine and sturdy. You can print on the first page glued to the front and back cover if you choose to do so.\n\nThe pages themselves feel thick since they are two prints glued back to back together. The glossy finish obviously has a reflection to it (but which glossy paper that doesn't) and there's very minimal to no texture.

I increased the exposure a bit (probably +1/3 stop) for some photos in post-processing while exporting photos used in this book. The prints look and feel very close to what I see on the screen and print personally on an Inkjet printer. Looking at the print above for an example, the highlights are intact and not pure white or blown away, there are some tones there. Shadows are not lost too, the subtle different tones are still rendered as I wanted which was quite surprising to me.\n\nLooking at the image below, it shows very subtle details in shadow areas (which may not be visible on a screen) like the dark trees area below the mountain in the center and some rock formations in this mountain also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2q5lc53ee561.jpg?width=3667&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87388d046a9f832643d8b915d950e59badadd1e1\n\nYou still get excellent deep blacks, like the following image shows where the sky looks black (which may not look so on a screen). The contrast of this print looks amazing, the white clouds on top of the mountains meet the dark black sky with zero color banding issues. This may be due to the continuous tone of RA-4 printing with this paper vs Inkjet printing for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lcqypo4ee561.jpg?width=3605&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c977474b37a488b3c2e4b75c99bde0b8cf61086e\n\nDeep shadows and subtle tones rendering looks amazing in color photographs too.

The Professional Line Photobook product did indeed feel professional and premium. The color rendering is very good with truly deep blacks, subtle shadow, and highlight tones that really impress.\n\nThe one thing that I felt missing is offering other types of paper for books, as Fuji Crystal Archive glossy has high gloss and even the matt version has a bit of sheen to it, it may not suit all photos and people, especially if you're looking for something with texture. For me, I love the Crystal Archive paper and use it personally.\u00a0\n\nAnother thing to note is that I capped the max number of pages allowed at 130 pages.

Not sure if this is a technique you guys are familiar with / have tried before, so here's a quick summary: when you're shooting macro photos with a macro lens, your \"depth of field\" is very shallow - it's hard to get an entire object in focus, unless it's perfectly flat and 90 degrees to the lens. For 3D objects, that isn't usually going to be the case. \n\nSo, to get a really sharp macro photo where the whole subject is in good focus, you need to shoot a bunch of photos in sequence, either adjusting your focus slightly each time, or leaving your focus as-is and move the camera forward (or backwards) for each pic. I tried doing the first technique (adjusting focus slightly over and over) but my results were always kinda crappy, probably due to my inexperience + the fact that I'm using a very old / cheap macro lens. I found I was over-adjusting each time and the output looked weird, with stripes that were in focus and stripes that weren't. Not great. \n\nI did more research and learned that I could improve my results by using a 'macro focusing rail' - basically, a piece of hardware you mount your camera to, which allows you to move the whole camera (and thus your focal point) forwards/backwards by microscopic increments. After my sweetie and I took our son on a Cub Scout hike in the Marin Headlands yesterday, we met up with a dude I found on Craigslist over in Sausalito, and he sold me his barely-used macro rail, and I've just done my first test shoot with it. \n\n[This pic shows my setup](https://i.imgur.com/JiIw8DD.jpg): Basically, the macro rail sits on the tripod, and the camera sits on a small carriage mounted to the rail and attached to a long threaded screw in the center. By turning that little crank at the back, the screw turns, which scoots the carriage forward/backward by tiny amounts.\n\nMy first test subject is my grandfather Frank's old pocket watch, which (if I remember correctly) he was given by his father when he and his twin brother Albert graduated high school. I got the macro lens [focused on the front edge of the pocket watch](https://i.imgur.com/AX06kuh.jpg), snapped a photo, turned the crank once (moving the camera forward a tiny bit), snapped a photo, turned the crank once, snapped a photo, etc. etc., all the way to the [very back of the watch.](https://i.imgur.com/Yr1YXI3.jpg) I used my remote trigger to avoid jostling the camera too much between shots. When all was said-and-done, I ended up with 38 photos, each with a slightly different portion of the pocket watch in focus. Just for fun, I also [combined all 38 photos into a GIF](https://imgur.com/bGNjuow), so you can see the focal point moving from one end to the other.\n\nSo, getting to the point: after combining all 38 photos using a *completely insane* shareware program called Helicon Focus, [I got a final output, combining the in-focus portions of each of the 38 photos](https://i.imgur.com/opfm5vU.jpg).

And when you start to see them, you can\u2019t stop photographing them. It\u2019s very addicting!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Look down.\n\nWe tend to look forward and see the bigger picture. But beauty is often just at our feet. Go low to the ground and look down occasionally. You\u2019ll find all kinds of interesting things. Think of textures on stones, lines little plants, patterns, contrast. Lots of interesting abstract shapes can be found on the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A simple mud cracks pattern](https://preview.redd.it/ke5i10j4qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf445712636425af84d3357796a4dd5d3b1dc678)\n\n[Autumn vegetation on the ground](https://preview.redd.it/6wb7k3q6qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c0b7c9371ff213fab85e668a53f3b446da78d1e)\n\n2. You don't need a macro lens.\n\nAbstract landscapes can be shot with any kind of lens. I usually shoot them with a 24-70 (close focus is a pre) or sometimes a longer lens to capture patterns in the distance.\n\n[Black sand ripples caused by the tide in Iceland](https://preview.redd.it/ygm7yhf9qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b266d6823541a0b3f913124267ee8b5f4f4784d0)\n\n3. Look at lines\n\nWhen looking at subjects, find lines and try to balance them in your frame. Lines going from a corner into the frame often work well. Flowing lines also give a nice feel to an image.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Interesting lines and textures on a hill in Iceland](https://preview.redd.it/1sgv7aibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff7b15c14aa0cf728ffae3329cfbd2918da011d6)\n\n[Grassy hills in Kyrgyzstan](https://preview.redd.it/av1g1bibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973d3f010894ea66be98a24a63ea65bd116c8a31)\n\n[Lines on a piece of ice going from bright to dark](https://preview.redd.it/da3krbibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7076b84a57688758ef1ab1407e2ceeeaeb57147e)\n\n4.

Lose perspective and scale. This has to do with looking at the smaller things in the \u2018bigger\u2019 picture again. When photographing abstracts its important to not show the surrounding. This way the viewer has no idea about the scale and perspective. When you photograph a sand texture the right way for example, it can look like a desert from above. It\u2019s fun to trick the viewer and let them think about your photo.\n\n[This could be an image of a desert shot from a plane, but its actually just a shot of some sand ripples shot with a 24-70 lens.](https://preview.redd.it/t0hlbi3qqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a4a67771d18590308c15f486b137935ee1aec4d)\n\n6.

Go to the beach! The beach often has lots of sand textures. Especially when the tide is low you can find patterns in the sand everywhere. They sometimes look like aerials and completely let the viewer lose perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A sand texture hit from the side by sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/0fq32u4vqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7552178819c8ba2a8498241ab0b66e8bc2f688ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Water. Water by itself is just incredible. Think of falling water from a waterfall or just the tap at home! Falling water in different strengths creates beautiful pattern. When photograph falling water, use an extremely fast shutter speed (1/1000 or faster) and just shoot away. You\u2019ll see you come up with lots of interesting shots! But not only falling water. Also ripples in the sea can create interesting photos depending on how the waves are and how the light hits. And then there is frozen water. Frozen water creates cracks and interesting ice textures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dropping water from a waterfall](https://preview.redd.it/jirtikiyqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed3cc5f934c7d1ed57e4c77901ecbd2c578de50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Waves](https://preview.redd.it/qbt9w6uzqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9df7d66b1dcd725c47865fd099667162e200fe)\n\n[A frozen piece of ice from up close looks like a hallucination pattern](https://preview.redd.it/nrtsh9mwqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ead1a46e24dbd28a1bb8a12dd71b5dc2a7a27ff)\n\n[Shapes in a frozen puddle](https://preview.redd.it/7dazc9t0rxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c11e44d2a7cb2fc77fd9899d5d9e5845523e6ab)\n\n9. Harsh light and shadows.\n\nHarsh light during the day is often not great for landscape photography. But for abstracts it can be great.

When photograph falling water, use an extremely fast shutter speed (1/1000 or faster) and just shoot away. You\u2019ll see you come up with lots of interesting shots! But not only falling water. Also ripples in the sea can create interesting photos depending on how the waves are and how the light hits. And then there is frozen water.

Abstract landscapes are everywhere. You just have to learn to see them. Textures in stones, lines in plants, clouds. The trick is to look closely.

For reference I use a Canon R5, Sony A7iii, and RED dragon regularly.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nIt feels like the people designing our cameras are doing so in a lab and not the real world where so many inefficiency's would easily be discovered. Of course, there are pros and cons to any new system, but a lot of these core designs have essentially been the same since the 1960's. Feels like legacy camera companies have gotten complacent and just hope for brand loyalty.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThese are just a handful of my overall camera gripes \u2013 each point adds another layer of complexity to any shoot that could easily be avoided. Yes, it would take some smart ergonomics engineers to perfect these hardware suggestions, but from my perspective no one's even tried to improve them in a meaningful way yet.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Lens Caps:**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* *Problem:*  Why are loose lens caps still the only way to protect your lens? Anyone whose shot at sunset while bouncing between different lenses knows the feeling of sorting thru 5 different front/back lens caps in their pocket afterwards...naturally some will be different sizes too (hope you brought your ring adapters). Not to mention lens caps already pop off easily when placing a camera in a tight bag which leaves glass exposed anyway...\n\n* *Suggestion:*  Build lens covers into the design of the lens. Yes it would take some figuring out on the engineer's side to keep it compact/strong, but is there really no other way?? What other products in 2021 require meticulous organization of custom protective covers?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**ND filters** *(more useful for video)*:\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* *Problem:*  Similar to the lens cap debacle.  Grabbing your camera for a quick shot...oh dang too bright...better run back to your bag and sort thru multiple cases of filters to screw onto your lens just to reduce the light. If you're switching lenses, gotta unscrew everything and put the ND's on a new lens. I know some cine cams have built-in ND's, but this should be standard across all cameras like having ISO.\n\n* *Suggestion:*  Build ND ability into the camera body or lenses. Again this would take some engineering to perfect in a compact way, but ND functionality should be as simple as adjusting shutter speed considering its so important to have ability to limit exposure for video/photo.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Screwdrivers/hex tools**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* *Problem:*  Today so many tools are required to mount accessories/tighten plates. I understand that screws are very universal, but that doesn't mean they are convenient to swap between in a timely manner. Sometimes you forget to put the tools in your pocket when you're running and gunning + they take time to setup.\n\n* *Suggestion:*  Engineer products in a way to EASILY mount/secure accessories without needing a toolbox with you at all times. Quick tighten knobs, magnets, etc\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Large Touchscreens**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*  *Problem:*  Photo/Video natively are a visual medium, yet most camera manufacturers are reluctant to provide a built-in display that is larger than 1\". Not only would ability to see the scene your photographing be much clearer, using the menus and changing settings would be improved 10x from current tab thru every menu screen design.\n\n* *Suggestion*:  The black magic pocket cinema cam is first company I've seen do a large, clean, and responsive touchscreen right (and it's affordable) \u2013 https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicpocketcinemacamera\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Super-simple wifi transfer to phone/laptop:**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* *Problem:*  Transferring media from camera to a phone is extremely clunky and lathargic (if it works at all). The immediacy of being able to share a photo to my phone or someone else's is hindered by that fact that you need to pull out your phone, open an app, etc. When I take someone's photo on the street I'd love to just airdrop it to them immediately or drop image to my phone within 10sec to share as a proxy or post online. This wouldn't be a problem if using the native apps worked seamlessly, but in reality they take minutes and are clunky.\n\n* *Suggestion:*\nInstant wifi transfer of photos/videos from DSLR to phone.
