I wanted to share a fun and interesting post on 6 ways you're using artificial intelligence without realizing it.\n\n It\u2019s so easy to think about sophisticated robots and self-driving cars (More on those later) when you hear about AI\u2014but there are many other ways it integrates into our lives.\u00a0\n\nSeeing as [the AI market size is estimated](https://www.statista.com/statistics/941835/artificial-intelligence-market-size-revenue-comparisons/) to be worth up to $190 billion, it\u2019ll become more obvious over time.\n\nNonetheless, artificial intelligence is saving you energy, keeping you safe, and making your life much more convenient while right under your nose.\u00a0\n\nWant to see how? Keep reading.\n\n## 1. Google Maps\n\nRemember that last time you road-tripped with your kids up to the cottage? Yep, that was artificial intelligence. It helped you stay safe and get you to your destination faster.\u00a0\n\nThis is because Google Maps, just like most map applications, is powered by AI. It\u2019s capable of finding the fastest and safest routes in real-time as traffic and road conditions change.\u00a0\n\nGoogle uses machine learning to analyze real-time data and make predictions about distance travelled potential interruptions and more.\n\nTake a look at how they also use [machine learning models to forecast bus delays](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/06/predicting-bus-delays-with-machine.html) in cities.\n\nData is extracted from transit agencies\u2019 feeds about bus positions related to car traffic speed and their planned stops. This helps people like you remain on schedule to work, school, etc.\n\nThat brings me to my next point.\n\n## 2. Search engines\n\nHello, Google. Could you tell me if you\u2019re powered by AI? The answer is *yes*.\u00a0\n\nBoth Google and its voice search counterpart is the best example of the daily use of AI. Who isn\u2019t quick to pull out their phone and use Google when they need to know something?\n\nThe search engine uses AI to predict what searches you want along with the most relevant results. Machine learning also continually refines the results and recommended searches based on the billions of inputs it receives every year.\n\nThat means that not only are you using AI, you\u2019re also contributing to making it more intelligent and improving the experience of other people all around the world!\n\n## 3. Siri\n\nHow many times have you heard \u201cHey, Siri\u201d followed by a question? Heck, you might do it yourself every day. From checking basic information to scheduling events, Siri\u2019s advanced machine learning technology supports a massive range of user commands.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s capable of detecting language and improving its *ability* to pick up on spoken words. This is because Siri uses branches of AI known as natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG.)\n\nYou can think of Siri as a search engine, as well. It uses the information it receives from users to improve the next query. Both errors and correct answers are noted to enhance the overall database of answers.\n\nHere\u2019s a cool fact, too: Siri\u2019s co-founder, Dag Kittlaus, [named the technology Siri](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2221246/steve-jobs-wasn-t-a-fan-of-the-siri-name.html) because it means \u201cbeautiful woman who leads you to victory\u201d in Norwegian.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s how I like to view AI: a technology that moves us towards achieving goals.\n\n## 4. Have you ever driven a Tesla?\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re opinion is on the Tesla Cybertruck, Elon Musk is a genius. The self-driving technology implemented into Tesla\u2019s cars is [a fine example of AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/13/five-emerging-ai-trends-to-watch-in-2020/) and machine learning.\u00a0\n\nFirstly, the car is capable of navigating through traffic, speeding up, stopping, changing lanes, and more. It\u2019s practically alive. Furthermore, machine learning continually improves how safe the car navigates, learns new roads, etc.\n\nThis also is thanks to the [DeepScale deep neural network software](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deepscale-attracts-15-million-investment-to-advance-automated-vehicle-perception-300623164.html) which detects objects of significance.\n\nThese include pedestrians, vehicles, debris, and other items that may come near you while driving. The AI continually learns how to detect and navigate these things better for continually safer driving.\n\n## 5. Uber\n\nYou\u2019re out with a few friends and have some drinks. How do you get home? Most likely Uber or Lyft, right? You can thank artificial intelligence for getting you home safe.\u00a0\n\nThis is because rideshare apps like Uber use AI to determine the price of your ride, minimizing wait time, routing the driver to you, etc.\n\nFor example, [the Uber heatmap](https://www.wired.com/2011/04/app-stars-uber/) shows drivers high traffic areas where rides will be in high demand.\n\nHow is this done? You guessed it: *artificial intelligence*. Their system measures and predicts demand based on requests along with weather-forecasting data.\u00a0\n\nNo matter if you\u2019re using an app like Uber to generate income or get around town, AI plays a role on both sides.\n\n## 6. The spam filter of your inbox\n\nWe all receive spam emails. In fact, there are approximately [14.5 billion spam messages sent every day](https://www.spamlaws.com/spam-stats.html).\n\nHowever, many times they never come across your eyes. Why is this? *The spam box*. This is an integral part of every email platform and\u2014in case you don\u2019t know\u2014it\u2019s powered by AI.\u00a0\n\nSpam filters are intelligent enough to decipher what message appears to be sent by humans or bots before appropriately filtering them. Additionally, some use machine learning to pick up on common traits and patterns to continually give you a better email experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nAI isn\u2019t as intimidating as some think. It\u2019s not reserved strictly for business, and in reality, is all around us.\n\nEverything from the apps we use to public transportation is being integrated with AI. The best part is that we don\u2019t realize this because it\u2019s so subtle. It\u2019s improving our daily lives while flying under the radar.\n\nWhat are other ways you know or think we use AI without realizing it?

Whether it is e-commerce or healthcare, almost all the industries are using Machine Learning extensively to make futuristic solutions and products. Machine Learning depends heavily on programs and algorithms that help machines self-learn without having to be instructed explicitly. Machine Learning is pretty much dictating our daily lives- how, you wonder? Let\u2019s look at the top applications of Machine Learning to understand how it is shaping the digital economy.\n\n## 1. Dynamic Pricing\n\nAs crucial as it is, pricing strategy is one of the oldest puzzles of the modern economy. Whether it is the entertainment industry or the consumables industry, efficient product pricing is essential for profit margins and affordability. Depending on the objective, there are several pricing strategies that businesses can choose for sales and marketing. However, choosing the right pricing strategy is easier said than done. Several decisive factors like cost of production, consumer demographics, demand curve, market control, value and more need to be adequately aligned for any product to be priced properly. Thankfully, Artificial Intelligence has effectively resolved this issue in recent times. AI-powered pricing solutions have helped businesses understand consumer purchasing behaviour and price their products accordingly.\n\nMachine learning tools use insights from data to create logic. This process improves with the amount of data that is fed to the machine learning system \u2014 the more the data, the better the results. Without using direct programs, these machine learning softwares use humongous amounts of data to improvise and deliver accurate pricing strategies. Machine learning algorithms use extensive data analysis to find optimised solution functionality. These softwares use various ML pricing models like granular customer segmentation with cluster analysis and competitor and attribute-based pricing and KPI-based pricing to reach an optimised pricing range.\n\n## 2. Transportation and Commuting\n\nAll the taxi-booking, vacation planning apps that you use run on machine learning. Whether it is customer experience or demand-supply gap, machine learning systems use data to manage and optimise the booking process. While using a ride-booking app, you must have come across recommended destinations. Machine learning algorithms use historical data to understand the most frequently travelled routes and provide suggestions accordingly. Apps like Uber and Ola use extensive data analysis to predict time and areas of demand. Once the app calculates the demand, drivers are alerted so that they can offer rides for that particular area. This is how ride-hailing companies manage the demand-supply gap. Machine learning algorithms also reduce ETA by recommending the fastest routes in real-time. For peak hours, this demand-supply predictions work by suggesting higher prices to make these services profitable.\n\nVacation planning apps use the same system to recommend the cheapest flight fares, hotel bookings, and more.\n\n## 3. Fraud Detection\n\nWhile the vast amount of data available on the internet makes for a great case of data studies and analysis, it also increases the chances of fraudulent activities. Machine learning is emerging as an effective technology to secure our cyberspace. Supervised and unsupervised ML models are being used to detect different kinds of online frauds, ranging from spotting anomalous behaviour to preventing money laundering. Even the entertainment and media industry is facing undeniable problems with online frauds. Fake news is a big issue today that can disturb the economic and political situation of any nation. ML semantic analysis studies structured, unstructured and table-type data to detect fake claims and news. ML algorithms also look through existing repositories of news to find similar claims and validate the authenticity of any news piece.\n\nSame holds true for online scams and identity threats. Fraud analysts across industries rely heavily on machine learning tools to investigate claims, news and more.\n\n## 4. Virtual Personal Assistant\n\nVirtual personal assistants have surfaced as one of the most significant finds of the 21st century. Machine learning algorithms have done phenomenal work in the field of speech recognition, natural language processing, text to speech and speech to text conversion. Once you ask them a question, they scan through the internet to find you relevant answers. In addition to that, they also keep track of your schedule, goals, and preferences to recommend relevant information. These virtual personal assistants feed on all your queries and inputs ( asking about the weather or the traffic) to continually improve and self-learn.\n\nML algorithms collect and refine information on the basis of any user\u2019s past behaviour. This process helps in customising results according to the user profile.\n\n## 5. Social Media\n\nWith more than 2.5 billion active users every month, social media platforms like Facebook and more are some of the biggest communities today. Social media has become an indispensable part of our lives. Targeted ads, friend suggestions, and personalised news feed are a few of the ways in which machine learning algorithms are improving our experience. Machine learning algorithms go through your profile to understand the friend requests you send, friends you connect with, groups you join, your interests, and based on that provide suggestions on who you can become friends with. Similarly, for Pinterest, ML algorithms recommend similar pins based on the objects (pins) you have pinned in the past.

It also uses techniques like NER (Named Entity Recognition), Chunking, POS tagging and more to understand language intonation and deliver the most relevant translation. Translation techniques include:\n\nDual learning: Texts are translated back and forth from one language to another repeatedly until a natural, accurate translation is delivered.\n\nDeliberation Networks: Similar to dual learning, this method involves translating the same text over and over again to improve the final results.\n\nAgreement regulation: ML algorithms read text from left to right and then from right to left again to create a match. The end result is a consensus from both directions to eradicate errors.\n\nMachine Learning has clearly made an entry into our lives and is here to stay. Its applications are no longer limited to enterprise use. ML programs and algorithms have evolved over time and taken over most industries to improve consumer experiences.\n\nIf you are interested in the domain of AI and machine learning and want to learn

pricing**\n2. **transportation and commuting**\n3. **fraud detection**\n4. **virtual personal assistant**\n5. **social media**\n6. **instant translation**\n\nmachine learning, a sub------> branch !!!  of [artificial intelligence](https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-artificial-intelligence-course), has established itself as the new go-to technology for businesses worldwide. whether it is e-commerce or healthcare, almost all the industries are using machine learning extensively to make futuristic solutions and products. machine learning depends heavily on programs and algorithms that help machines self-learn without having to be instructed explicitly. machine learning is pretty much dictating our daily lives- how, you wonder? let\u2019s look at the top applications of machine learning to understand how it is shaping the digital economy.\n\n## 1. dynamic pricing\n\nas crucial as it is, pricing strategy is one of the oldest puzzles of the modern economy. whether it is the entertainment industry or the consumables industry, efficient product pricing is essential for profit margins and affordability. depending on the objective, there are several pricing strategies that businesses can choose for sales and marketing. however, choosing the right pricing strategy is easier said than done. several decisive factors like cost of production, consumer demographics, demand curve, market control, value and more need to be adequately aligned for any product to be priced properly. thankfully, artificial intelligence has effectively resolved this issue in recent times. ai-powered pricing solutions have helped businesses understand consumer purchasing behaviour and price their products accordingly.\n\nmachine learning tools use insights from data to create logic. this process improves with the amount of data that is fed to the machine learning system \u2014 the more the data, the better the results. without using direct programs, these machine learning softwares use humongous amounts of data to improvise and deliver accurate pricing strategies. machine learning algorithms use extensive data analysis to find optimised solution functionality. these softwares use various ml pricing models like granular customer segmentation with cluster analysis and competitor and attribute-based pricing and kpi-based pricing to reach an optimised pricing range.\n\n## 2. transportation and commuting\n\nall the taxi-booking, vacation planning apps that you use run on machine learning. whether it is customer experience or demand-supply gap, machine learning systems use data to manage and optimise the booking process. while using a ride-booking app, you must have come across recommended destinations. machine learning algorithms use historical data to understand the most frequently travelled routes and provide suggestions accordingly. apps like uber and ola use extensive data analysis to predict time and areas of demand. once the app calculates the demand, drivers are alerted so that they can offer rides for that particular area. this is how ride-hailing companies manage the demand-supply gap. machine learning algorithms also reduce eta by recommending the fastest routes in real-time. for peak hours, this demand-supply predictions work by suggesting higher prices to make these services profitable.\n\nvacation planning apps use the same system to recommend the cheapest flight fares, hotel bookings, and more.\n\n## 3. fraud detection\n\nwhile the vast amount of data available on the internet makes for a great case of data studies and analysis, it also increases the chances of fraudulent activities. machine learning is emerging as an effective technology to secure our cyberspace. supervised and unsupervised ml models are being used to detect different kinds of online frauds, ranging from spotting anomalous behaviour to preventing money laundering. even the entertainment and media industry is facing undeniable problems with online frauds. fake news is a big issue today that can disturb the economic and political situation of any nation. ml semantic analysis studies structured, unstructured and table-type data to detect fake claims and news. ml algorithms also look through existing repositories of news to find similar claims and validate the authenticity of any news piece.\n\nsame holds true for online scams and identity threats. fraud analysts across industries rely heavily on machine learning tools to investigate claims, news and more.\n\n## 4. virtual personal assistant\n\nvirtual personal assistants have surfaced as one of the most significant finds of the 21st century. machine learning algorithms have done phenomenal work in the field of speech recognition, natural language processing, text to speech and speech to text conversion. once you ask them a question, they scan through the internet to find you relevant answers. in addition to that, they also keep track of your schedule, goals, and preferences to recommend relevant information. these virtual personal assistants feed on all your queries and inputs ( asking about the weather or the traffic) to continually improve and self-learn.\n\nml algorithms collect and refine information on the basis of any user\u2019s past behaviour. this process helps in customising results according to the user profile.\n\n## 5. social media\n\nwith more than 2.5 billion active users every month, social media platforms like facebook and more are some of the biggest communities today. social media has become an indispensable part of our lives. targeted ads, friend suggestions, and personalised news feed are a few of the ways in which machine learning algorithms are improving our experience. machine learning algorithms go through your profile to understand the friend requests you send, friends you connect with, groups you join, your interests, and based on that provide suggestions on who you can become friends with. similarly, for pinterest, ml algorithms recommend similar pins based on the objects (pins) you have pinned in the past. computer vision, a subset of machine learning, scans through images to identify objects and patterns and uses this data to create recommendations.\n\ncomputer vision is also used for the face recognition feature in facebook and google. every time facebook asks you to tag yourself in a photo, it is because computer vision has scanned through your facial features to recognise the features unique to you. once the ml systems have collected sufficient data on your facial features, it can accurately suggest the tag.\n\n## 6. instant translation\n\ngoogle translate and other such apps are making language barriers a thing of the past. apps like google
