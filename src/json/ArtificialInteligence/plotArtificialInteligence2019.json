The field of Artificial Intelligence has gotten in numerous applications contributing a great portion of profits to several fields.\n\nArtificial intelligence is evolved over time and has become an integral part of many industries. The number of areas where artificial intelligence is being applied is increasing rapidly. AI has got a list of amusing benefits to offer any sector. Few of these include risk analysis, error detection, accurate future prediction, cost reduction and many more.\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence has impacted many wide fields like gaming, agriculture, healthcare, finance, marketing, and many more.\n\n# Let us learn about the top ten real-time applications of artificial intelligence in various\u00a0fields.\n\n### 1. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\n\n[Artificial Intelligence in Health Care Industry](https://preview.redd.it/51cyr33p5fy31.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d87720cca883cc50d981e758a7fb410a8c5e64)\n\nIt is mind-boggling to notice the advancements of [**Artificial Intelligence in the Health Care Industry.**](https://www.greatlearning.in/blog/how-ai-can-improvise-healthcare-industry/) The applications of artificial intelligence can be seen in a wide variety of applications ranging from preparing prescriptions until conducting complex operations. A group of MIT researchers has built a tiny robot that unfolds itself in the stomach and treats swallowed button batteries, wounds. Artificial Intelligence is also used to prepare a prescription for patients based on individual medical conditions. Besides, Artificial Intelligence also used in assisting the physicians to diagnose report accurately. The list goes on. This is also used for measuring accurate results of patients\u2019 responses toward certain medications. In this way artificial intelligence aids in offering better medical services.\n\n### 2. Artificial Intelligence in Speech, Language and Voice Recognition\n\nWith the breakthrough of Google Home and Alexa Echo, Voice Assistants have become popular. Smartphones these days come with a voice assistant that will guide the consumer on traffic, search engine queries, translate a language, provide support for speech to text conversion\n\nGoogle has also introduced Google wireless earbuds that translates a language without any help from a human. This has been achieved by Artificial Intelligence. These practices have been practiced by most of the sectors like businesses, marketing, customer support and many more to enhance their services.\n\n### 3. Artificial Intelligence in\u00a0Gaming\n\n[Artificial Intelligence in Gaming Industry](https://preview.redd.it/hnqieo776fy31.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31fbf21787008dd741c210cecbb6a10b3c4c5991)\n\nThe quality of a game cannot be measured alone by the user interface. Rather, a good game requires a good Artificial intelligence inbuilt for the characters. This is more accurate to any combat games like Battlefield, and Destiny. These games top the list because of their complex Artificial Intelligence algorithm. Gaming companies like RockStar and Ubisoft deliver games with great Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Thus, these companies make a good market compared to their competitors.\n\n### 4. Artificial Intelligence in\u00a0Finance\n\nWith the advent of the Internet, Net banking has made our lives hasslefree. Netbanking comes with its own risks. It could be a phishing attack or a fraudulent transaction. Artificial Intelligence will be able to avoid risks associated with fraudulent activities, avoiding scams that occur through emails. Artificial Intelligence helps many economic businesses such as the income tax sector, credit card companies, to optimize various processes and regulate better financial services by performing many functions like effectively studying the customer\u2019s history to grant loans, develop accurate predictive models and many more.\n\n### 5. Artificial Intelligence in Transport\n\n[AI in Transportation](https://preview.redd.it/n4thh94f7fy31.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=056fc30f9ae18bb4d213c546dd26322c55023364)\n\nAfter the space project, Elon Musk has aimed at producing self-driving cars sooner than later. Self-driving cars will minimize road accidents to a greater extent as the cars are enabled with artificial intelligence that predict accidents in advance and avoids them impeccably. It is unfathomable to notice the applications of Artificial Intelligence in other areas of transport like Maps. There used to be a time where people used handheld maps for navigation. These maps had to purchased regularly as maps will be modified according to the change in the landscape. Besides, the maps don\u2019t provide the best route to the customer. [**Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.greatlearning.in/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) enabled map applications to provide the best route to the customer by using different algorithms that consider various factors like traffic, routes.\n\n### 6. Artificial Intelligence in Marketing\n\n[Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing ](https://preview.redd.it/mdex6l5q7fy31.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ffcc206c93ffb9c5e6dabf4e6fdeb3383eaf604)\n\nArtificial Intelligence helps in promoting commercials within less time and budget. Right add at the right time makes the business. Artificial Intelligence promotes the maximum accuracy of a digital marketer for promoting his products and services. The employment of several techniques of artificial intelligence in the field of marketing promotes accurate recommendations of products to the customers which also results in the enhancement of the user experience as the users experience personalized shopping experience.
