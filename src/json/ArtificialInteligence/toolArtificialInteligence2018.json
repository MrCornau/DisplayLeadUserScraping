This makes it simple for business marketers to communicate with their leads and provide them personalized experiences.

In this way, they benefit from AI without having to spend a huge amount of money on it. \n\nSo let us go through some of the best AI-based apps.\n\n## Recombee\n\nIt is an recommendation engine that uses machine learning at its core. It can deliver more than 500 recommendations after any user action. It uses a combination of content centric algorithms for titles and descriptions as well as collaborative filtering algorithms for analyzing human behavior. According to this app, AI is capable of deciding which algorithm is to be used according to the availability of data.\n\n## Dynamic Yield \n\nIt is an email solution platform that uses behavioral data like purchase history, email clicks and other similar activities to personalize emails. Its ability to create dynamic email templates is one of the best things.\n\nFirstly, the marketer has to set the parameters that will make the application send an email. Then this tool uses machine learning algorithms to decide which message is to be sent to the customer based on the individual attributes that has been collected. It learns to predict preferences and thus results in maximizing revenue as well.\n\n## Adext AI\n\nIt uses artificial intelligence and machine learning together for picking the best audience for ads by automatically optimizing budget across different platforms. This can help a great way in getting better content and art for one\u2019s campaign to connect with the target audience base with more personalized content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Picture Courtesy - Adext](https://i.redd.it/ivht0k0ylpv11.png)\n\nThis tool may be the easiest way to benefit from AI as it generates a potential audience base which you could never have imagined before.\n\n## Bookmark\n\nIt is an AI design assistant that builds websites according to the sections, elements, images and much more which are relevant to the industry. It scans the web to find and learn about the business clients and the type of business they run.
