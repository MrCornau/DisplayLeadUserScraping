But very few people outside of this sub can really define what artificial intelligence is or why it's useful.\n\nFor us, we think of artificial intelligence as a tool that allows you\u00a0to intuitively discover the relationship between inputs and outputs. What goes into an AI model can be translated, converted, and put to work via a variety of methodologies.\u00a0\n\nFor example, an input may be drone footage of a disaster area (photo) and its output could be a damage estimate (financial).\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll explore all of the different kinds of inputs and outputs you can work with to build AI solutions.\n\nWhen combined with your existing data, these possibilities can give you the building blocks you need to string together a powerful AI capability for your organization.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what your company can do with its data, then this will definitely get your wheels turning.\n\n# Think about AI as Inputs and Outputs\n\nSo now that we've explored how AI is a tool for finding the relationship between inputs in outputs, let's define what some of those major inputs and outputs can be. \n\n# Inputs\n\n# SEMANTIC DATA\n\nBy now, AI is super-human in its ability to understand and process language. This is obviously super useful because a huge part of the world\u2019s information is one kind of communication or another. We\u2019re talking documents, books, handwriting, articles, speech, etc.\u00a0\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models think about language in terms of each word\u2019s relationship to related words. We can think of NLP models as a vast 3-D word cloud where related words cluster together forming vectors of associations and understanding. In effect, language processing models convert language into mathematical relationships.\n\nAlthough this may sound a bit abstract, our brains actually process language in a similar way. Consider this sentence:  \n*The dove dove into the water.*\n\nMost of us can pretty easily intuit from the sentence structure that the first *dove* is the noun and the second *dove* is an action related to water.\n\nLanguages like German, Chinese, and Korean drop these associations right into their vocabulary. For example, in German, *kindergarten* literally means *child garden*. In Korean, the word for *fish* (\ubb3c\uace0\uae30) is a compound of *water* (\ubb3c) and *meat* (\uace0\uae30).\n\nAll of this is to say that by quantifying the relationships words have to other words, AI language models have gotten extremely adept at learning to read, write, translate and summarize with ease.\n\n## QUANTITATIVE DATA\n\nAI models are built on complex mathematical equations so it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that AI speaks the language of numbers. AI models can vacuum up all sorts of quantitative data such as statistics, analytics, dates, sequences, financial information, etc.\n\n## Multimedia\n\nWhereas semantic and quantitative data uses abstract concepts as inputs, multimedia data is much more concrete. When considering what multimedia data you might be able to use, think about your senses:\n\n* Visual data can include photography, video, satellite footage, video surveillance\n* Auditory data such as sound recordings or RADAR.\n* Sensory data such as temperature or LIDAR.\n\nHell, if you\u2019ve got an [electronic nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_nose?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-95ooUXjGQzht7-GRYkNbKLkGV4mg9nB3gDFY3Vyd2XVAY0wsgy4OE5HrmPwMQ8-_mOX7Y7xTptCnsr2cAi0_quRMeEXQ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_source=hs_email), you could even consider olfactory information.\u00a0\n\nBy the way: data scientists can build AI models that consider datasets from all of these categories at once. For example, you could build a healthcare diagnostic model by integrating a doctor\u2019s description of the patient\u2019s symptoms (semantic), their bloodwork (quantitative), and chest Xrays (multimedia).\n\n# Outputs\n\nAs we discussed in [Chapter 1](https://www.manceps.com/resources/complete-ai-guide/chapter-1-what-is-artificial-intelligence), AI models build intuition about the relationship between inputs and outputs. To better understand how your organization could put AI to work, you\u2019ve got to consider both. Broadly speaking, AI can be used to do two main things: surface information or create content.\n\nSurfacing information includes things like categorization, pattern recognition, and prediction. These outputs can then be piped into systems that either (a) deliver this essential information to stakeholders for better decision-making and/or (b) put this information to work via some kind of hardware or software.\n\nFor example, an AI model that surfaces a stock prediction could be put into production as a daily email that arrives in your inbox or as an app that will automatically conduct trades for you.\n\nAlternately, AIs can be used to create content. In a broad sense, the types of content that cognitive intelligence can create is similar to the inputs that AI can consider. For example, AIs can produce both articles and images of all kinds of crazy iterations, as we\u2019ll discuss below.\n\nLet\u2019s consider each of these outputs in more detail:\n\n## SURFACING INFORMATION\n\n### Categorization\n\nAI is all about using data to make judgments or find patterns. In the case of categorization, AI creates a series of mathematical relationships to map the relative similarities and differences of similar objects. This kind of labeling is useful for all kinds of businesses.\n\nConsider these examples:\n\n* Quality assurance inspectors determine if a product is defective.\n* Doctors determine if a patient\u2019s bloodwork means they are healthy.\n* Mortgage lenders determine if an applicant is highly qualified.\n* Grocery stores determine if their produce is starting to rot.\n* Marketers identify conversion-optimized landing pages.\n* Programmers locate broken code.\n\nWith enough examples, an AI model could be trained to support the labeling/categorization process of any of these use cases.\n\n### Pattern Recognition\n\nWe can think of pattern recognition as a much more complex version of categorization. Whereas categorization usually considers one set of inputs, pattern recognition can consider an almost limitless number.\n\nIt\u2019s this type of AI capability that enables credit card companies to detect fraud, retail organizations to elastically price items, and self-driving cars to make instant driving decisions.\n\nWhen imagining how to bring pattern recognition capabilities to your organization, think in terms of the systems or processes you have in place to make decisions.\n\n### Predictive Analytics\n\nWith the right data, artificial intelligence is capable of making all kinds of predictions from heart attacks to stock market fluctuations to hurricanes. Very few companies are tapping into this future-facing capability and those that do tend to be primarily focused on tactical use cases like predictive maintenance.\n\nHowever, having visibility of future events means that business leaders have the tools they need to make adjustments to their supply chain, their strategy, and the execution of their objectives.\n\nWith the right data, you can answer almost any question about the future. The oracle is real.\n\n### Personalization\n\nToday AI-driven recommendation engines power your Netflix queue, your Amazon home screen, your Google search results, and your Spotify playlist. Every single time you read or click-through (or click away) these companies are gathering information about your interests and your preferences.\n\nIn fact, it is a similar engine that is driving much of the advertising across the internet. You know that feeling you sometimes get that Facebook is listening to you? The reason this may feel so is that their predictive engines are so powerful they\u2019ve mapped a veritable galaxy of data points to identify things that they should try to sell to you.\n\nPersonalization offers companies the opportunity to have perfect product-market alignment. By being able to offer each of your customers something a little different, you ensure that the products and services you offer resonate in an unforgettable way.\n\n## CREATING CONTENT\n\nIn a broad sense, all of the inputs we discussed above can also become outputs for an AI model so let\u2019s take them one at a time. For example:\n\n### Written or Spoken Communication\n\nAI can generate all kinds of language as outputs, such as articles, summaries, labels, etc. We\u2019re not just talking printed text here. As Amazon Alexa has shown, AI-generated communication can also be piped to voice-activated assistants.  \nIn the case of articles, AI has taken all sorts of information to auto-generate articles. Publishers are using the capability to automatically write weather reports, sports stories, and updates on financial markets.\n\nText summarization is particularly powerful and can be a huge opportunity for your organization. AI can literally take a 2,000-page patient case file, extract the necessary information, and summarize it into a paragraph or two. A use case might be a law firm that converts boxes of handwritten evidence into an index of every item that\u2019s there.\n\n### MULTIMEDIA\n\nAlready AI is generating a wealth of visual or auditory content. Artificial intelligence has been used to generate images of human faces, color black and white photos, write music, and create soundscapes, produce charts and graphs.\n\n# Translating Inputs and Outputs\n\nAs a final note, keep in mind that AI models become crazy powerful when you use them to translate one input type into a different output type. For example, an AI model could be trained to convert drone footage of a disaster area into a 12-page summary report for FEMA.\n\nTo be sure, building such a model would be complex, requiring both image processing layers to determine damage and text summarization layers to write that damage into easy-to-understand paragraphs \u2014 however, it is this exact type of complexity you should be thinking about when imaging the kinds of AI solutions to bring to your company.\n\nRemember: artificial intelligence can transform information into almost anything!  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_

[Peter Hogg](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/SHR-11-2018-0094/full/html) proposes the understanding that the implementation of AI is rising in the workplace, and through this implementation many people believe their jobs will become obsolete.\n\n*Well, I\u2019m here to tell you otherwise.*\u00a0\n\nIt prevails that AI will compliment the future of our jobs and become more successful when carried out alongside human work. As stated in my previous post, humans are able to work alongside AI to ensure collaborative work can occur. According to \u2018[Are Robots Taking Our Jobs?](https://www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000z__w__/_acnmedia/pdf-84/accenture-collaborative-intelligence-2018.pdf)\u2018 by James Wilson and Paul Daugherty, \u201cthe total amount of work available had not decreased after the introduction of computer-based technologies\u201d(Daugherty &amp;\u00a0 Wilson 2018). They recall five principals that can help them become more collaborative when working alongside the technology, including:\n\n* Reimagine business processes;\n* Embrace experimentation/employee involvement;\n* Actively direct AI strategy;\n* Responsibly collect data and\n* redesign work to incorporate AI and cultivate related employee skills.\n\nA survey carried out with 1,075 companies in 12 varying industries industries showed \u201cthat the more of these principles companies adopted, the better their AI initiatives performed in terms of speed, cost savings, revenues, or other operational measures\u201d (Wilson &amp; Daugherty 2018).\n\nMoving forward with these ideas in mind, it was of my upmost interest to uncover if employees are concerned about and more importantly, what level of understanding they have of the topic. From here I endeavoured to have them have a positive outlook on the introduction of AI. This was achieved through an interview with a supply chain employee from a medical manufacturing company, with asking the following [questions](http://%28https//docs.google.com/document/d/19o4dlqrqpQpI9ea6jXVVFVtac_N4g_Z750lzuxo39kw/edit)).\n\n* *WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT AI?*\n* *From what I have read AI isn\u2019t here just yet, not in the traditional sense of a sentient being locked inside a computer\u2026The end goal of current AI is to have you stay on their site for longer or spend more money.*\u00a0\n* *WHAT ASPECTS OF YOUR JOB CAN BE IMPROVED BY AI?*\n* *There are three main elements to my job \u2013 planning, system maintenance and communicating to sales. The biggest improvement AI could bring would be in the planning space\u2026As a human, I make errors and can miss flags indicating I should increase or decrease stock levels. I imagine an intelligent AI could perform this task with ease, removing the human error and increasing service levels to customers.*\n* *HOW IS AI INCORPORATED INTO YOUR JOB?*\n* *Currently, it isn\u2019t. We have low level planning systems that require human intervention. As with anything that requires human intervention, it is prone to mistakes and therefore can be improved.* \n* *WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK AI WILL HAVE ON YOUR JOB/OVERALL COMPANY?*\n* *An intelligent planning system (perhaps controlled by AI) could theoretically manage inventory globally without intervention by others. This would mean that all inventory planning positions in the world, as well as manufacturing planning could be made more efficient or removed\u2026I imagine that the future of supply chain will see people working with AI to assist it, rather than programs assisting them in their job.*\n* *IN THE LONG TERM, WHERE DO YOU THINK WE WILL BE IN REGARD TO IMPLEMENTING AI INTO SOCIETY/WORKFORCE?*\n\n*I think the sci-fi version of AI is still a way off. I think that implementation of AI could improve efficiencies in some companies by reducing human error (and by reducing the number of humans)\u2026Nick Bostrom titled \u2018Superintelligence\u2019 asks concerning questions about the introduction of AI and highlights that if the correct steps aren\u2019t taken, the implementation of such technology might not be as beneficial as we\u2019re led to believe.*\n\nThrough the employees answers it is vital that supply chain workers are scared about the security of their jobs. This interview was provided to set the idea of how little awareness some employees have about AI and how some of their fears could be seen as irrational, once they have looked at AI in the correct light.\n\n*Thus, this blog post is to work as a tool of education for these employees, rather than another old blogpost.*\n\nWilson and Daugherty outline ways that companies are able to get the most value from AI, and their conclusion was that operations are to be redesigned. For this to be successful, companies who are adopting the technology are to define an operation area that is able to be improved and then AI will be able to be implemented into that are of the workplace.\u00a0Furthermore, companies must develop a solution through co-creation.

[peter hogg](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/shr-11-2018-0094/full/html) proposes the understanding that the implementation of ai is rising in the workplace, and through this implementation many people believe their jobs will become obsolete.\n\n*well, i\u2019m here to tell you otherwise.*\u00a0\n\nit prevails that ai will compliment the future of our jobs and become more successful when carried out alongside human work. as stated in my previous post, humans are able to work alongside ai to ensure collaborative work can occur. according to \u2018[are robots taking our jobs?](https://www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000z__w__/_acnmedia/pdf-84/accenture-collaborative-intelligence-2018.pdf)\u2018 by james wilson and paul daugherty, \u201cthe total amount of work available had not decreased after the introduction of computer-based technologies\u201d(daugherty &amp;\u00a0 wilson 2018). they recall five principals that can help them become more collaborative when working alongside the technology, including:\n\n* reimagine business processes;\n* embrace experimentation/employee involvement;\n* actively direct ai strategy;\n* responsibly collect data and\n* redesign work to incorporate ai and cultivate related employee skills.\n\na survey carried out with 1,075 companies in 12 varying industries industries showed \u201cthat the more of these principles companies adopted, the better their ai initiatives performed in terms of speed, cost savings, revenues, or other operational measures\u201d (wilson &amp; daugherty 2018).\n\nmoving forward with these ideas in mind, it was of my upmost interest to uncover if employees are concerned about and more importantly, what level of understanding they have of the topic. from here i endeavoured to have them have a positive outlook on the introduction of ai. this was achieved through an interview with a supply chain employee from a medical manufacturing company, with asking the following [questions](http://%28https//docs.google.com/document/d/19o4dlqrqpqpi9ea6jxvvfvtac_n4g_z750lzuxo39kw/edit)).\n\n* *what do you know about ai?*\n* *from what i have read ai isn\u2019t here just yet, not in the traditional sense of a sentient being locked inside a computer\u2026the end goal of current ai is to have you stay on their site for longer or spend more money.*\u00a0\n* *what aspects of your job can be improved by ai?*\n* *there are three main elements to my job \u2013 planning, system maintenance and communicating to sales. the biggest improvement ai could bring would be in the planning space\u2026as a human, i make errors and can miss flags indicating i should increase or decrease stock levels. i imagine an intelligent ai could perform this task with ease, removing the human error and increasing service levels to customers.*\n* *how is ai incorporated into your job?*\n* *currently, it isn\u2019t. we have low level planning systems that require human intervention. as with anything that requires human intervention, it is prone to mistakes and therefore can be improved.* \n* *what impact do you think ai will have on your job/overall company?*\n* *an intelligent planning system (perhaps controlled by ai) could theoretically manage inventory globally without intervention by others. this would mean that all inventory planning positions in the world, as well as manufacturing planning could be made more efficient or removed\u2026i imagine that the future of supply chain will see people working with ai to assist it, rather than programs assisting them in their job.*\n* *in the long term, where do you think we will be in regard to implementing ai into society/workforce?*\n\n*i think the sci-fi version of ai is still a way off. i think that implementation of ai could improve efficiencies in some companies by reducing human error (and by reducing the number of humans)\u2026nick bostrom titled \u2018superintelligence\u2019 asks concerning questions about the introduction of ai and highlights that if the correct steps aren\u2019t taken, the implementation of such technology might not be as beneficial as we\u2019re led to believe.*\n\nthrough the employees answers it is vital that supply chain workers are scared about the security of their jobs. this interview was provided to set the idea of how little awareness some employees have about ai and how some of their fears could be seen as irrational, once they have looked at ai in the correct light.\n\n*thus, this blog post is to work as a -----> tool !!!  of education for these employees, rather than another old blogpost.*\n\nwilson and daugherty outline ways that companies are able to get the most value from ai, and their conclusion was that operations are to be redesigned. for this to be successful, companies who are adopting the technology are to define an operation area that is able to be improved and then ai will be able to be implemented into that are of the workplace.\u00a0furthermore, companies must develop a solution through co-creation. which will see ceos and employees envision how they will collaborate with the technology to improve a variety of processes that are already carried out within the business, of\u00a0 supply chain.\n\n*so how exactly are a.i. and robotics impacting supply chain?*\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* recent [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/global-ai-survey-ai-proves-its-worth-but-few-scale-impact)\u00a0out of mckinsey finds 61% of executives report decreased costs and 53% report increased revenues as a direct result of introducing artificial intelligence into their supply chains.\n* robotics are being used to track and locate inventory within the warehouse to ensure supply chain work is completed more efficiently and helps the robots make autonomous decisions regarding the different processes that are performed in the warehouse.\n* ai provides the supply chain with contextual intelligence which can be used to reduce the operating costs and manage inventory.\n\noverall, it is evident that ai can have a positive impact on the supply chain workplace when implemented in the correct way, as these companies see the biggest growth when humans and smart machines collaborate. moving forward it is important ask, when will this ai be implemented and furthermore when will *we* be train to better comprehend these bots.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 3, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/gcq913/how_will_artificial_intelligence_impact_the/',)", "identifyer": 5600008, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "themaxi4", "date": 1594934879000, "content": "Dont know if right subreddit - need to find recurring number pattern in a row of numbers, does anyone here know a tool for this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/hsisvi/dont_know_if_right_subreddit_need_to_find/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "ArtificialInteligence", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "dont know if right subreddit - need to find recurring number pattern in a row of numbers, does anyone here know a -----> tool !!!

Firstly, let us see the differences:\n\nIt has been long since the concept of Artificial Intelligence has been brought to existence and, since then, have not only progressive but also at times threatened to take the place of humans. It wouldn't be wrong to say so because at times they have proven to have higher speed of execution, higher operational ability and higher accuracy as compared to that of the humans. Also, the jobs which are tiring and boring according to the humans are very easily done by these machines.\n\nOn the other hand, **human intelligence** is known for its instinctive nature and spontaneity meaning **human intelligence** can act according to its surrounding and does not depend on the pre installed data as is the case for artificial intelligence. Also, the layers and depths present in the human brain cannot be made in the machines as they are way too complex.\n\nArtificial Intelligence taking over Human Intelligence: The Truth\n\nAlthough, it might seem that the machines have been very close in imitating the human behaviour and actions, as going by the recent developments, but the truth, however, is far from it. What makes **human intelligence** or humans in general superior is their ability to apply the knowledge that we have gained after logically reasoning and understanding a particular situation. There have been times when these machines with artificial intelligence have failed to take rational decisions because they do not possess common sense. \n\nHowever, having said that, there is not a single doubt that **artificial intelligence future** looks nothing but bright at the moment and after overcoming a few inefficiencies that they have, these machines will benefit us in several ways by coexisting with and helping humans for a better future.\n\nThe role of artificial intelligence in different fields\n\nThere has been an increasing amount of demand for artificial intelligence in almost all of the industries. The list below discusses some of the major fields in which artificial intelligence can play a big role.\n\n**1. Health Care:**\n\nJust like all the other fields, **Artificial intelligence in healthcare** also has major impact and often provides a better way of treatment than the traditional methods. In the cases where the patients lose their ability to speak, think or interact with others or their surrounding in any way due to some neurological diseases, **artificial intelligence in healthcare** plays a great role as these experiences can be regained by brain computer interface(BCIs) which can restore them. **AI in healthcare** can be used for the modification of the radiology tools which would be able to give accurate and detailed results and the use of tissue samples for diagnostics purposes would not be necessary. There is also another aspect of **artificial intelligence in healthcare** which can solve major problems and that is by taking over some diagnostics tasks allocated for humans. This can help in reducing the deficit of trained healthcare providers as there is a lack of them in life savinv cares in developing nations.\n\nArtificial intelligence is a very powerful weapon against **COVID-19** and if properly used, the recent progress in artificial intelligence features can be used to diagnose, predict and also control **COVID Effects**. Ever since the pandemic broke out there has been a massive support for using artificial intelligence in fighting **COVID-19** and efforts are going on in inspecting whether it will help reduce **COVID Effects** or not\n\n**2. Retail:**\n\nThe shopping options and their comforts would increase so much if there were personal recommendations and AI provides virtual shopping capabilities which can be used for this and many other purposes. As a matter of fact, the stock market and site designs can also benefit from artificial intelligence.\n\n**3. Banking:**\n\nOne of the major advantage of artificial intelligence over **human intelligence** is its ability to perform the tedious job in an efficient and fast paced manner. In financial institutions, AI can be used for several purposes from detecting the frauds to correcting the data to automating the management of huge data which are manually handled.\n\nThe impact just does not stop here, in order to emphasise on the point that **artificial intelligence future** is going to be in our favour, listed below are some already made **artificial intelligence projects.**\n\n**1. Brain-inspired Projects:**\n\n**\\*** Blue Brain project which is the project based on the concept of creating synthetic brain through the process of reverse engineering the brain of mammals. \n\n**\\*** Google Brain project is another attempt, as mentioned earlier, to achieve a level in **artificial intelligence future** where it is of the equal rank as that of **human intelligence**.\n\n**2. Cognitive architectures based projects:**\n\n**\\*** CALO is an **artificial intelligence project** which is funded by DARPA and is under the supervision of 25  institutions. This artificial intelligence project aims to gather all the important features of artificial intelligence like speech recognition, machine vision, probabilistic logic and many other features of **artificial intelligence and machine learning** and instill all of fhese features into a single AI assistant which will help in the office environment.\n\n**\\*** CoJack is an **artificial intelligence project** which is inspired by ACT-R and is an or feature to be added to the JACK multi-agent system for the enhancement of more human like characteristics to make it more realistic in virtual environments. Another attempt of **artificial intelligence project** to establish **human intelligence** in **artificial intelligence future**.\n\nAs can be seen from the above mentioned details of how artificial intelligence has impacted our world in such a positive way and how the the **artificial intelligence future** looks so progressive that it will be a privilege for anyone to be able to contribute to rapidly growing industry in technology. This can be done very easily by mastering at least one(or more) **artificial intelligence course**. There are several **learning sources** available right now. There are **free online courses** as well as paid online courses. These **artificial intelligence courses** are very much efficient and these really helps you grow in this field becoming an AI expert and thus contributing in one way or the other to the above mentioned industries. \n\nThe  Best options to choose for Artificial Intelligence Training Programme among Hyderabad and Chennai\n\nAlthough there are many options to choose from, listed below are the best institutions for artificial intelligence training programme that are present in big cities like Hyderabad and Chennai.\n\n**1.

The tool reads documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to gain useful insights. It also utilises several unique machine learning models to extract specific data from documents used in mortgage lending.\n\n**AI: A game-changer for financial inclusion**\n\nFinancial inclusion has remained a challenge for India, even though Jan-Dhan accounts have ensured the provision of basic banking services to the poor. Aadhaar-enabled DBT has also not only plugged leakages but also ensured timely benefits and access to cash, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic. All these initiatives need to be scaled up to provide more financial services to the poor, farmers and the self-employed by enabling easy access to credit and ensuring that agriculture activities are supported and businesses are funded to help add value and create jobs.\n\nWith the push for increasing farmers\u2019 access to financial services, banks and financial institutions have to be wary of financial frauds and must be equipped to conduct fair credit assessments. AI-based tools can enable all this by using data and machine learning algorithms to detect financial frauds, assess creditworthiness and help banks offer quality advice to customers. AI can also help improve customer service, sales, and retention efforts of banks.\n\nIf you are looking to learn Artificial Intelligence, Great Learning has several [Artificial Intelligence online](https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-artificial-intelligence-course) and classroom training programs.

AI can help us solve numerous problems of varying complexities.\n\nOne such type of problem is the case where one has to predict outcomes using the given pool of knowledge. Here, the knowledge base is given and using logical rules and reasoning, one has to predict the outcome.\n\nThese problems are usually solved using Inference Engines, which utilize their two special modes: **Backward Chaining** and **Forward Chaining**.\n\nAs we progress, let\u2019s have a detailed look at both the chaining processes used in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n### What is an Inference Engine?\n\nAn Inference Engine is a tool of Artificial Intelligence that is used as a component of the system to deduce new information from a knowledge base using logical rules and reasoning. The first-ever Inference Engines were a part of expert systems in AI. As previously stated, Inference Engines predict outcomes with the already existing pool of data, comprehensively analyzing it and using logical reasoning to predict the outcomes.\n\nThis same process would be repeated as new facts would be discovered and this would make the inference engine trigger additional rules for its findings. After some runs of the inference engine, it was noticed that Inference Engines works in one of the two ways, either based on goals or based on facts, which later came to be known as **forwarding chaining** and **backward chaining**.\n\nForward chaining comes with known facts and iterates the process to find new facts while backward chaining starts with goals and works backwards to determine what conditions would be required to achieve the given goals.\n\n### Forward Chaining\n\nForward Chaining is one of the two main methods of inference engine which uses the logical process of inferring unknown truths to find a solution from the known set of data by using determined conditions and rules.\n\nYou can say that generally complex tasks can be reduced into multiple simpler tasks that are performed either simultaneously or sequentially, just like a chain or chaining is an effective method of teaching complex skills and processes using multiple steps.\n\nAs a data-driven as well as bottom-up logic approach, forward chaining starts from known facts and conditions, then progresses towards logical conclusion using if-then statements. Then these conditions and rules are applied to the problem until no further applicable situations are left or the limit has been reached. Forward Chaining searches for any solutions and can come up with an infinite number of possible conclusions.\n\n### Forward Chaining in\u00a0AI\n\nThe Forward-thinking approach is used in AI to help an AI agent solve logical problems by inspecting the data from the previous learnings and then coming to a conclusion full of solutions. That\u2019s not all, Forward Chaining might as well be used to explore the available information or answer a question or solve a problem. Forward chaining is extensively used to break down a long and complex logical approach by attaching each step once the previous one is completed. This way, it goes from beginning to the end with relative ease.\n\n### Backward Chaining in\u00a0AI\n\nThe Backward Chaining approach is used in AI to find the conditions and rules because of which a particular logical result or conclusion was reached. Real-life applications of Backward Chaining include use to find information regarding conclusions and solutions in reverse engineering practices as well as game theory applications.\n\nSome other applications of Backward Chaining include automated theorem proving tools, inference engines, proof assistants and other **artificial intelligence applications**.\n\n### Difference between Forward Chaining and Backward\u00a0Chaining\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zpuem1tjxr51.jpg?width=553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e35f066b1d79e43f01c8fccc814b9342584ee3a5\n\nAmong the several Artificial intelligence programs that are offered by various institutions, the [artificial intelligence courses](https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-artificial-intelligence-course/) in Great Learning are really productive because these AI courses not only help you grow individually but their placement cells make sure that you get into one of these top companies.

By examining the accuracy of this system, the blog points out the advantages and disadvantages of having a system. It also gives examples about the newest systems used.\n\nFire department assets are essential starting with the truck, special appliances fire-fighters depend on, and their equipment. There is no way fire-fighters can go on a mission without the tools needed. Since lives could be in any danger, fire-fighters should trust the equipment they are using and know where the tools are. Hence, fire-fighters need a fire department inventory and asset tracking system which will allow them to locate and double check their appliances.\n\nWhat is a fire department inventory and asset tracking system?\n\nA fire department inventory and asset tracking system is a system having several consumable and non-consumable items such as station supplies, truck wash, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS). These items require recharging and should be located easily for them to be used. When an system is installed it can:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Deduce if any of the tools is missing and rapidly locate their place.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Accurately maintain documents and records.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EMS benefits from tracking inventory and assets.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Access and determine data.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reduce wastes if managed properly.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Allow fire-fighters to have a budgeting flexibility.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reduces risks such as injuries concerning fire-fighters.\n\nWays to get started and develop on Inventory and Asset Tracking Systems:\n\nUsing paper and pen and Excel spreadsheets are extremely a waste of time. However, some departments still depend on these manual ways. Errors appear more when dealt with human factors and it is hard to make improvement with data. Moreover, manual management systems are a costly way to manage fire departments starting from storage to wasted time and productivity. Hence it is crucial to transfer to a more productive, not costly system.\n\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set a plan:\n\nIn order to know the amount of items to be purchased for the fire department and maintain them it is necessary to set a plan. Without it, progress can be made but creating a management system will be a struggle.\n\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reset products:\n\nFor the system to kick off, the department must get rid of any recent waste. Without taking this into consideration, the department will hold overstocked or unnecessary equipment, not only filling storage but also investing money in the wrong place.\n\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Power of Data:\n\nAs soon as you start looking for the right data, the earlier you can figure out the progress and improvement. The more accurate the data is, the more productive the systems will be.\n\nBarcode technology is a great step in fire department inventory and asset tracking systems. They are made of a group of lines defining a particular code related to the company they are referring to. With barcodes, it is better to know the system than to use manual methods. Moreover, there are various types of barcodes which are:\n\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1D barcodes:\n\nThese Barcodes are one-dimensional, that is they are a series of vertical lines where distances between them vary.\n\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2D barcodes:\n\nThe 2D is a pattern of black quadrilaterals on a white template. It is the most common form.\n\nIn the fire department industry, scanning barcodes using devices such as smoke detectors provide fire chiefs with an explanation and the life of the tool hence enhancing quick action for any imperfections.\n\nAdvantages of using barcodes:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Barcodes reduce human errors where keyboard data give one error in every 300 entries however that of a barcode creates one in three million\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Using these systems eliminate employee training time\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 They are not as costly as manual methods\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Provide better and accurate data\n\nHowever, barcodes need a line of sight to be known. Scanners often need to be 15 feet of the barcode for it to interpret the data. Barcodes are usually present on papers or plastic materials that are easily damaged and they cannot be read by a scanner. So here are some barcode disadvantages:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Items are scanned individually thus taking more time\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Barcodes are easily copied\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Provide the basic information concerning an item only\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Barcodes contain information that cannot be updated\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Interpret the type of tool only\n\nWhat is RFID?\n\nRFIDs are data containing tags that are tackled via radio waves. The scanner has antennas which transfer radio-frequency signs in order to read tags and data.\n\nAdvantages of RFID:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Can read data without line of sight.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lasts more than barcodes in the case of any damage occurrence.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Can be read from much greater distances than barcodes.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Information can be increased and updated.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More secure and hard to be copied or duplicated.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Can have more detailed data than barcodes.\n\nOn the other hand, RFIDs are more expensive and can be easily subjected to any signal collision. The RFID implementation process is more complicated than the barcode one.\n\nThere are several systems used to track firehouse assets. This System can track the expiration date of tools thus the fire chiefs know exactly when to order new equipment.\n\nFinally, fire chiefs should adapt to inventory and asset tracking systems tracking their firehouse assets rather than using manual methods such as keyboard data and Excel sheets to save money and time and to reach more productivity enhancing a better understanding of what they have from appliances. Instalment of barcodes is a necessity for more detailed and accurate data.
