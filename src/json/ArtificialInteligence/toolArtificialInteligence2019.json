Teachers will be standing in front, giving instructions and sharing notes on a modern-day version of the old blackboard-say, an overhead projector or a shared computer display. Students will be sitting at their desks in the classroom or watching via online video-conferencing software. The technology has changed: A lot of the tools and processes have been digitized, some of it has been automated, and geographical barriers have been removed to some extent\u2014but the actors and elements have remained much the same.\n\nBut thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a slow but steady transformation is coming to education, under the hood. In a few years, teachers will no longer be alone in shouldering the burden of training the young generation or the workforce at corporations.\n\nAlready, AI algorithms are helping enhance education by collecting, analyzing, and correlating every interaction that takes place in physical and virtual classrooms, and helping teachers to address the specific pain points of each student. This might be the beginning of a revolution in one of the oldest and most valuable social skills that mankind has developed, and an imperative in a world where humans live and work alongside smart machines.\n\n**Measuring Learner Progress**\n\nInstructors have to take into account every reaction to a lecture, every blank or attentive stare, every eager or hesitant response to a question, every assignment that is turned in early or late, and a lot more when assessing a student's grasp of a concept. This is how they can find out where students are lagging and steer them in the right direction.\n\nIt is also why measuring a learner's progress, an endeavor that is deeply social in nature, is one of the biggest challenges every teacher faces, and a task that is hard to accomplish with classic rule-based software.\n\nHowever, machine learning algorithms, which are based on analyzing and finding patterns and correlations between data points, are proving to be an effective tool in helping teachers quantify a student's understanding of a lecture.\n\nThe data is then used to build a model that can give real-time insights into a student's understanding and engagement with specific topics. Data models also help in finding common patterns among multiple students and performing predictive analytics, such as forecasting how students will perform in the future.\n\nMore advanced use of AI can involve the employment of complicated computer-vision algorithms to analyze facial expressions, such as boredom and distractions, and link those to the other data gathered on students in order to create a more complete picture of a student's learner model.\n\n## Finding and Addressing Gaps in Teaching\n\nWhen students lag behind in a lesson, flaws in teaching methods and curriculum are often as much to blame as weaknesses in the students themselves. Was the cause of student misunderstanding something about the material itself, the manner in which it was presented, or the timing of the material within the flow of the curriculum? Was it that the student had the flu when some necessary concepts were covered previously? How did the student engage with the material\u2014actively or passively?\n\nThose are some of the questions that every teacher has to answer when assessing the quality of a delivered lesson and investigating the root causes of problems in learning.\n\n## Education Will Remain a Social Experience\n\nWhile we've seen impressive efforts in the application of artificial intelligence in education, the results pale in comparison to other domains where AI algorithms are causing major disruptions.

Upselling is the  practice of recommending your users to choose a comparatively better and  more expensive product than the one they have chosen. The upsell  products usually appear on the shopping cart page, so upselling is  incorporated during shopping cart development. Cross-selling is the  practice of showing related products or complimentary products, which  can be purchased together with existing products. Upselling and  cross-selling has proven to boost the sales enormously, and that is why  they are the must-have extension for any e-commerce store.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Popup upsell products based on the current cart items\n* Assign related items for each product\n* Smart recommendation with AI\n\n### 4 Site Search\n\nFor any e-commerce site, it is not possible to put all the products  on the single page, and that is why there are structured product and  category pages. Just like a website cannot survive without a good  navigation, efficient site search also plays an equally significant  role. Shoppers these days directly go to the site search without even  going through couple of product pages. Magento 2 offers very limited  on-site search capabilities. Fortunately, there are plenty of Magento 2  site search extensions and Magento 2 customization that empowers your  search with incredible features.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Auto-complete search results\n* Semantic search predicts user intention\n* Smart search suggestions\n* Flexible search configuration options\n* Instant search results\n\n### 5 Reporting\n\nGetting an insight on the underlying business processes is vital for  any organization.

Centric Enterprise ](https://i.redd.it/y6fw8oggoxc21.png)\n\nOver the past few years, we have seen tremendous advances in [machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.mavenick.co/3-step-maturity-model-for-your-automation-centric-enterprise/). Rooted in these inspiring technologies is the idea of robotic process automation (RPA), the possibility of automating routine and mundane tasks with software robots capable of interacting with traditional software systems in the same way as human operators would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnterprise executives are attracted by the numerous benefits of RPA, which include significant cost savings and productivity improvements, but they are often left wondering how to best adopt RPA to drive long-term growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, deriving the promised benefits from RPA initiatives is not an easy job. Per world\u2019s leading analyst firm \u2013 HfS Research \u2013 more than 50% of the RPA initiatives haven\u2019t been successful. As per this report, more than 60% of the C-level executives have either said that they are dissatisfied with the results from RPA or have been somewhat satisfied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this article, we introduce a simple 3-step maturity model for creating an automation-centric enterprise, where intelligent automation spans across physical infrastructure, business management software, operations management, analytics, process automation, artificial intelligence and information security, as visualized below. When an enterprise successfully reaches the last step of our model, the enterprise is ready to transition into a cognitive- and data-oriented model of operation and fully reap all the benefits of RPA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ 3 Step Maturity Model for Your Automation Centric Enterprise ](https://i.redd.it/12bt3q3joxc21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STEP 1: AD-HOC PHASE**\n\nMost enterprises start adopting RPA on a case-by-case basis. During this phase of RPA adoption, no holistic automation strategy is yet in place, and all tool evaluation and process selection criteria are driven solely by individual team leaders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though the ad-hoc phase is not governed by any enterprise-wide automation strategy, it is not without a purpose. The adoption of RPA on a case-by-case basis establishes the groundwork for enterprise-wide RPA adoption, considerably reducing the amount of friction such adoption would cause otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the ad-hoc phase, the organization should be careful about a few critical aspects :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have an organization wide strategy, you cannot have the cost and benefits analysis before you start any automation. Without this, you might end up automating something of low or no value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStart with quick wins in mind. If the top management doesn\u2019t see these quick wins, they will lose interest. So it is important to start with simple processes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not fall into the trap of believing that delivering quick wins enables your team to take on complex processes. There are several aspects that your team needs to be trained on before you touch complex automation. E.g. Change Management, Deep Technical and process engineering skills, operating model, the center of excellence, governance, business model and execution framework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ad-hoc phase is the perfect time for requirement gathering. The enterprise should carefully evaluate how RPA could best fit into its existing technology environment, and the enterprise should also come up with long-term adoption goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTEP 2: ADOPTION PHASE\n\nBased on the gathered requirements and the desired long-term RPA adoption goals, a center of excellence is setup, a clear automation adoption strategy is defined, with an evolution model available for scaling the automation across the enterprise. The clearer the enterprise manages to articulate its adoption goals, the more effectively the adoption can be orchestrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe selection of a specific RPA platform should be based on formally defined evaluation criteria, and the criteria itself should extend beyond the needs of individual functional silos.

Intelligent code completion-\n\nCode completion has consistently been a key factor for developer productivity. It accelerates the process of coding applications by decreasing errors and other basic mistakes. Today, code completion usually works using an in-memory database of classes, variable names, and different constructs defined in the application. When the user starts typing, IDEs search for possible matches and suggest them in a pop-up window.\n\nArtificial intelligence is now adding logical expectation to code completion. Let\u2019s consider an example where a user starts typing a variable name as now. The IDE can offer completion to the method of getting the current time from the DateTime interface. If a developer types a variable as color, the IDE can offer completion from an interface characterizing the theme of the application. Google recently declared Dart 2.5 SDK with ML Complete- code completion powered by machine learning. It works using a TensorFlow Lite model to predict the conceivable next symbol as the developer is editing.\n\n### 2. Intelligent prefetching-\n\nWeb developers today have been performing code splitting with webpack and other comparable libraries. Development in these libraries has allowed us to optimize the manner in which our code is delivered to the end user. Predictive prefetching could be achieved by preparing a model to predict what pages users are likely to visit dependent on their journey. This can be a basic model that depends on data about how the application is being utilized in general. Further development can be made using deep neural networks to analyze a particular user.\n\nOther than the user\u2019s journey, there are different factors that can influence the probability of a page to be visited next. For instance, links closer to the user\u2019s hand position on a mobile device are more likely to be visited than links farther from the user\u2019s quick reach.\n\nGuess.js is so far the most ideal approach to add predictive prefetching to web applications. It has a webpack plugin and supports [**Angular**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/new-features-of-angular-8-0/), Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Gatsby.\n\n### 3.Automated test cases-\n\nTo take UI testing to the next level, image recognition is used. Dynamic UI controls can be recognized regardless of their shape and size, so AI can examine interfaces to check whether changes are advantageous or break the system. AI can also help in analyzing whether certain parts of UI match with the requirements and desires of the audience the product serves.\n\nCreating unit tests that fulfill all conceivable use cases can be teasing now and again. Artificial intelligence has an automated test case generation. By using AI-generated unit tests, developers can accomplish higher code coverage while splitting the time and effort required to build a thorough and significant suite of unit tests.\n\nAnother case is predicting user journeys by inspecting current information and creating flows for end-to-start tests. This will allow the QA engineer to concentrate more on testing new features while remaining secure about keeping current functionalities intact.\n\nHere are a few of the tools that leverage AI to transform software testing:\n\n* Test.ai: A company by ex-Google and ex-Microsoft test leads. It offers an AI-powered test automation platform to help mobile application distributors deliver quality user experiences to their customers.\n* Testim.io: A machine learning tool that authors, executes, and also maintains automated tests.\n* AISTA: While it isn\u2019t actually a tool, the Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing Association connects testers using AI for QA purposes\n\n### 4. Better SEO: Better keywords and multilingual image tagging-\n\nFrom technical reviews, keyword research, and content optimization to content distribution, tag management, and internal linking, AI is making an immense difference in how SEO is done today. Alongside creating multilingual content from one source, AI is also helping to generate relevant meta information.\n\nIt was an expensive task for large scale e- commerce organizations to generate proper keywords against every product image they showed, and also finding the important tag for different languages added a lot to the expense. Today, refined image recognition techniques can automatically generate multilingual tags from the images on display.\n\nAlso, advancement in content analysis are helping content writers and entrepreneurs in producing relevant tags and keyphrases against large documents. This also helps writers to effectively link between the content they have produced previously with freshly brewed stuff.\n\n### 5. Tailoring experiences for everyone-\n\nArtificial intelligence is here to control the next generation in website personalization. This could change the nature of the internet forever. We are going towards a time in which websites will adapt themselves to give an ideal experience custom- made uniquely for each user.\n\nThat may well be possible through a development of the AI tools that power today\u2019s artificial design intelligence (ADI) platform and analytics systems. With big investments from organizations like Adobe and Wix, there\u2019s certain to be a prosperous future ahead for ADI.\n\n## Conclusion-\n\nBased on how AI has influenced the modern world- and the speed at which it is still advancing- clearly we\u2019ve just observed the beginnings of the disruptive force that this technology will apply in the business.\n\nGoing ahead, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that AI will play an essential job in each feature of software development.\u00a0\n\nAs technology progresses, it affects in many ways in many industries.

 that authors, executes, and also maintains automated tests.\n* aista: while it isn\u2019t actually a tool, the artificial intelligence for software testing association connects testers using ai for qa purposes\n\n### 4. better seo: better keywords and multilingual image tagging-\n\nfrom technical reviews, keyword research, and content optimization to content distribution, tag management, and internal linking, ai is making an immense difference in how seo is done today. alongside creating multilingual content from one source, ai is also helping to generate relevant meta information.\n\nit was an expensive task for large scale e- commerce organizations to generate proper keywords against every product image they showed, and also finding the important tag for different languages added a lot to the expense. today, refined image recognition techniques can automatically generate multilingual tags from the images on display.\n\nalso, advancement in content analysis are helping content writers and entrepreneurs in producing relevant tags and keyphrases against large documents. this also helps writers to effectively link between the content they have produced previously with freshly brewed stuff.\n\n### 5. tailoring experiences for everyone-\n\nartificial intelligence is here to control the next generation in website personalization. this could change the nature of the internet forever. we are going towards a time in which websites will adapt themselves to give an ideal experience custom- made uniquely for each user.\n\nthat may well be possible through a development of the ai tools that power today\u2019s artificial design intelligence (adi) platform and analytics systems. with big investments from organizations like adobe and wix, there\u2019s certain to be a prosperous future ahead for adi.\n\n## conclusion-\n\nbased on how ai has influenced the modern world- and the speed at which it is still advancing- clearly we\u2019ve just observed the beginnings of the disruptive force that this technology will apply in the business.\n\ngoing ahead, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that ai will play an essential job in each feature of software development.\u00a0\n\nas technology progresses, it affects in many ways in many industries. and is also done with the software development industry.
