Over the next decade, we will witness a radical shift from partial mistrust and skepticism to complete dependence on AI and other advanced technologies. Most AI-powered applications are consumer-facing, which is another solid reason for mainstream users to overcome the trust barrier over time. With more exposure and more access to technological solutions for their daily business, the Citizen Data Science community will pave the way for a new-technology-order world.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is getting deeper into our daily lives, but this is not as scary as many may\u00a0think. With Artificial Intelligence, we have seen things getting better and easier for us but this change does not stop at homes. Today many businesses are coming forward to use AI in new different ways so as to engage their customers, drive sales and make business processes simpler. In short, the demand for Artificial  Intelligence development services will go high in the coming years.\n\nWe have already seen how Facebook was using AI to improve its ad campaigns as well as seen the effective use of AI-powered chatbots. So,  what\u2019s next? What should we expect out of Artificial Intelligence in the new year to boost business success?\n\n**The Future of AI**\n\nIn the post-industrialization era, people have worked to create a  machine that behaves like a human. The thinking machine is AI\u2019s biggest gift to humankind; the grand entry of this self-propelled machine has suddenly changed the operative rules of business. In recent years,  self-driving vehicles, digital assistants, robotic factory staff, and smart cities have proven that intelligent machines are possible. AI has transformed most industry sectors like retail, manufacturing, finance,  healthcare, and media and continues to invade new territories.\n\n## More Advanced AI Assistants\n\nWith the introduction of Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, and other kinds of similar devices, consumers were seen hugely benefitting from AI  assistants in their homes. Such AI assistants can be used to get a  weather report, to play a song, to switch off the lights in the room, to look for some information online, and much more.\n\nThe new AI-powered technology is being embraced by consumers.  Based on the study of\u00a0Adobe Analytics, it is said that around 71 percent of people who owned smart speakers used them at least once in a day while around 44 percent of smart speaker owners who admitted using it multiple times in a day. So in 2019, we will be able to see more of advanced AI assistants helping homes and workplaces as well as influencing other areas of life.\n\nToday, users make AI assistants do basic tasks like the search for information online or play a song. In the coming years, the changes will be big as AI assistants will be seen doing bigger tasks. They will be able to offer individualized experienced to the users just by recognizing the voice of the users.\n\nSo instead of just speaking to AI devices like we do today, there will soon come a time where you will be talking to your TV or refrigerator.\n\n## Job Changes\n\nArtificial Intelligence has been instrumental in helping businesses to reach efficiency in what they do. For the same reason,\u00a0job creation will be negatively affected by AI. With AI helping businesses to simplify different processes, certain positions filled up by humans will be taken off. The process of reskilling and retraining workers will become very crucial in the coming years with the increase of AI  presence. The process should start as early as possible so that the people will be skilled and ready enough to take the advanced work.\n\n## Where can I learn about Artificial Intelligence for free?\n\nThere are a few places you can learn about Artificial  Intelligence Summit. For example, many of the top tech universities in the world have uploaded content you can watch for free on sites like  YouTube.\n\nYou could also consider taking some of their online courses\u00a0on such topics.\n\nBut if you want to sit down and complete an actual course, here are some of the best courses that are available at the moment.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence Summit by Simpliv\n\nThis AI Summit will evaluate the nature and scale of changes that AI  could bring about in various sectors such as retail, enterprise,  consumer and commerce.
