Subject tracking works great if the animals are not rapidly changing and you can't keep the center on the subject long enough to lock on. The AF is fast enough for wildlife.\n\nOkay, before anyone complains, I'm a photographer, not a testing lab. I can just share my experiences and you can take from it what you like. No complaints about my methodology please.\n\nFirst a quick side-bar. Let's talk wildlife. People may envision traipsing through the woods looking for bears or moose (and that is part of it), but wildlife includes bugs on flowers, birds sitting on branches, chasing squirrels in your backyard, tigers at the zoo (though some could argue that's not really wildlife), or going on a safari. \n\nIn general, bugs on flowers aside, having a super-telephoto lens is about the one constant. Birds and squirrels are small. Larger birds like raptors tend to be skittish around people and unless you're walking through a neighborhood in Anchorage, those moose are going to usually be downrange from you. (Are moose in Anchorage really wildlife or more like pets? Yes, I have photographed moose in an Anchorage neighborhood before. A 70-200 was almost too much lens)\n\n[A neighborhood moose in Anchorage, AK. Probably a Nikon D200 + AF-S 80-200 f\\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/sr69mi59b9661.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9fd32bafc2ba05e84534fde45e3ea218b6c4a18)\n\nThere is a misconception though about the camera that you need. Clearly, a high-resolution sensor is helpful. It gives you room to crop, and when you should not be closer than 50 meters to a bear, that extra cropping is useful. The 45.7mp D850 and Z 7/Z 7II's 1.5x DX crop produces a 20mp image, the same as the D500, which is a nice way to turn that 500mm lens into a 750mm effective lens.\n\nBut in many cases you don't need 14 frames per second. You don't need lighting fast autofocus. That bear or moose isn't going to be moving very fast. Maybe if you're lucky enough to be chasing a cheetah taking down a zebra on a safari, anything over 8 fps should be usable. Sure 14 fps will be cool.  But AF just needs to be good enough. In many wildlife cases, you have time to get the animal in focus and even use tracking mode. Again, naturally faster is better, but not required.\n\nIn my recent trip to the zoo with the Z 6II and 200-500/FTZ combo, I only missed two shots out of 345 because I wasn't able to get the animals in focus. I'm constantly nailing focus on the birds and squirrels in the back yard. Maybe in the future, I'll get a chance to find that wild cheetah running through the African savannah.\n\n[Elk Bull, NC Zoo - Nikon Z 6II + AF-S 200-500mm f\\/5.6 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/ya0uzqlsb9661.jpg?width=4044&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f493a3032adc58dcc25082570755d2a0aae1742)\n\nBirds in flight, well that's a totally different story. They are small, fast, and like to change direction and distance to and from your position. Sure, a hawk making lazy circles in the sky isn't all that challenging, but an osprey diving into the water to grab that fish is a time where you are going to want those 14 frames per second. You need AF to be tracking the bird throughout its dive and subsequent departure, which isn't always linear. You can't control the path the bird takes to or from you.\n\nYou certainly need incredible AF to do this, and you need a deep buffer to handle some fairly long 3-4 second bursts (50+ photos).\n\nToday, I took my Z 6II + AF-S 200-500mm f/5.6 + FTZ adapter along with my D500 and a 1.4x TC to a local river that sits just below the dam for one of our local reservoirs. This is a popular place to go birding because we have bald eagles, osprey, red tail and red shoulder hawks, vultures, great blue herons, cormorants, gulls, and more. \n\nFWIW, I saw a couple of bald eagles, but they were too far down the river and heavily backlit to get anything. They also were not flying around much. I had a couple of great blue herons, but they really were not being active either and were hiding out in brush or in situations where you couldn't separate them from the background. Who needs another heron portrait anyway, right? (You do. You know you do!)\n\n[Great Blue Heron. Nikon D500 + Nikon AF-S 200-500mm f.5.6 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/1720edeu19661.jpg?width=3322&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f2e4b5510a4299ff1281e7ab21e7945a56b2fb5)\n\nBut I had hundreds of gulls and quite a few active cormorants to play with. That was fine, I wanted to play with birds in flight anyway.\n\nI tried the Z 6II in Wide-Area AF. I also have my Fn1 button set to put the camera into Subject Tracking mode. These two modes were really all I should need for birds in flight. I'm not much of a back button AF person, but it seems to work better in Subject Tracking mode as the Z 6II's trigger's half-press is pretty short compared to the DSLRs I've used over the years.\n\nI was very, very frustrated with Subject Tracking and the gulls. In this mode, you're presented with a square in the center of the finder that's probably about 9 AF points big. When you half-press or back focus AF, the white box turns yellow, and whatever is there will be tracked. This generally works pretty well, but I guess my reflexes with that big lens were just too slow. I would just watch the yellow box zip to the right side of the viewfinder as I panned left trying to keep up with the gulls. Basically, it got out of the box before the camera could lock on. I feel like I'm 100% blame for this. That lens is big and heavy and those birds were moving... fast... I just couldn't keep that small box on the small bird long enough for it to lock on.\n\nWhen it did catch, it worked pretty well, though trying to follow the yellow box will trick you as it's movement sometimes lags where it's really at. The proof was in the photos. If I got the gull in initial focus, the next few frames (typically a 3-5 frame burst) were also in focus. But more often than not, I wasn't taking photos because I didn't get a lock on.\n\nThe cormorants were quite a bit easier to track, their movement was slower and less chaotic. They tended to fly in straighter lines or bigger arcs. The gulls were pure chaos. The photo below is from a 20 frame burst over 2ish seconds. All of them were in focus.\n\n[Cormorants flying in formation. Nikon Z 6II + 200-500mm f\\/5.6 @ 500mm.](https://preview.redd.it/ogomunrt49661.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9f2ea47eeb778f83003c1db560ac9260b49f4b)\n\nAfter a while, I wasn't getting anything, so I switched over to the D500. I put the 1.4x TC on to see if I could get the down-river eagles. This gave me an effective 1050mm f/8 lens. I tried to track the gulls with this setup as well. I tried both group mode and 3D tracking. The D500 struggled to lock on as well. I suspect it was the TC since it was making the lens f/8 instead of f/5.6. Sadly I didn't try taking the TC off to get a speed comparison. But the Z 6II lock-on speed (when I was able to get a lock on) seemed to be as fast as the D500. I didn't get enough of a feel to see if the 3D tracking was able to track better. I suspect it is.\n\nI went back to the Z 6II and the gulls. This time, I didn't mess with Subject Tracking racking mode. I just let the Wide-Area AF do its thing. For the most part, it found them and kept them in focus. It was able to drive that big lens and reasonably keep up with those randomly moving gulls.\n\n[Gull in flight - Nikon Z 6II + Nikon AF-S 200-500mm f\\/5.6 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/ios604te89661.jpg?width=3956&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6a22c3ed3e43b98b1ac243365ab7c109047f6b)\n\nAF speed was good enough to track birds in flight. It handled the big lens quite well.  Being able to Subject Track something that's moving chaotically and quickly is hard for me to do. Since I wasn't shooting in Single AF point mode, I was shooting more like 12 fps with the camera. The viewfinder lag (well showing the last shot briefly between frames) is a touch jarring.  \n\nI have no doubt that people will be very successful shooting all kinds of wildlife, though some rapidly, randomly moving birds will be a challenge with Subject Tracking, though Wide-Area AF should do the trick.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/kgmilz/nikon_z_6ii_af_test_vs_birds_in_flight_w_afs/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "nikon z 6ii af test vs. birds in flight w/ af-s 200-500 f/5.6 /!/ tl;dr - wide-area af works great for birds in flight. subject tracking works great if the animals are not rapidly changing and you can't keep the center on the subject long enough to lock on. the af is fast enough for wildlife.\n\nokay, before anyone complains, i'm a photographer, not a testing lab. i can just share my experiences and you can take from it what you like. no complaints about my methodology please.\n\nfirst a quick side-bar. let's talk wildlife. people may envision traipsing through the woods looking for bears or moose (and that is part of it), but wildlife includes bugs on flowers, birds sitting on branches, chasing squirrels in your backyard, tigers at the zoo (though some could argue that's not really wildlife), or going on a safari. \n\nin general, bugs on flowers aside, having a super-telephoto lens is about the one constant. birds and squirrels are small. larger birds like raptors tend to be skittish around people and unless you're walking through a neighborhood in anchorage, those moose are going to usually be downrange from you. (are moose in anchorage really wildlife or more like pets? yes, i have photographed moose in an anchorage neighborhood before. a 70-200 was almost too much lens)\n\n[a neighborhood moose in anchorage, ak. probably a nikon d200 + af-s 80-200 f\\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/sr69mi59b9661.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9fd32bafc2ba05e84534fde45e3ea218b6c4a18)\n\nthere is a misconception though about the camera that you need. clearly, a high-resolution sensor is helpful. it gives you room to crop, and when you should not be closer than 50 meters to a bear, that extra cropping is useful. the 45.7mp d850 and z 7/z 7ii's 1.5x dx crop produces a 20mp image, the same as the d500, which is a nice way to turn that 500mm lens into a 750mm effective lens.\n\nbut in many cases you don't need 14 frames per second. you don't need lighting fast autofocus. that bear or moose isn't going to be moving very fast. maybe if you're lucky enough to be chasing a cheetah taking down a zebra on a safari, anything over 8 fps should be usable. sure 14 fps will be cool.  but af just needs to be good enough. in many wildlife cases, you have time to get the animal in focus and even use tracking mode. again, naturally faster is better, but not required.\n\nin my recent trip to the zoo with the z 6ii and 200-500/ftz combo, i only missed two shots out of 345 because i wasn't able to get the animals in focus. i'm constantly nailing focus on the birds and squirrels in the back yard. maybe in the future, i'll get a chance to find that wild cheetah running through the african savannah.\n\n[elk bull, nc zoo - nikon z 6ii + af-s 200-500mm f\\/5.6 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/ya0uzqlsb9661.jpg?width=4044&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f493a3032adc58dcc25082570755d2a0aae1742)\n\nbirds in flight, well that's a totally different story. they are small, fast, and like to change direction and distance to and from your -----> position !!! . sure, a hawk making lazy circles in the sky isn't all that challenging, but an osprey diving into the water to grab that fish is a time where you are going to want those 14 frames per second. you need af to be tracking the bird throughout its dive and subsequent departure, which isn't always linear. you can't control the path the bird takes to or from you.\n\nyou certainly need incredible af to do this, and you need a deep buffer to handle some fairly long 3-4 second bursts (50+ photos).\n\ntoday, i took my z 6ii + af-s 200-500mm f/5.6 + ftz adapter along with my d500 and a 1.4x tc to a local river that sits just below the dam for one of our local reservoirs. this is a popular place to go birding because we have bald eagles, osprey, red tail and red shoulder hawks, vultures, great blue herons, cormorants, gulls, and more. \n\nfwiw, i saw a couple of bald eagles, but they were too far down the river and heavily backlit to get anything. they also were not flying around much. i had a couple of great blue herons, but they really were not being active either and were hiding out in brush or in situations where you couldn't separate them from the background. who needs another heron portrait anyway, right? (you do. you know you do!)\n\n[great blue heron. nikon d500 + nikon af-s 200-500mm f.5.6 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/1720edeu19661.jpg?width=3322&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f2e4b5510a4299ff1281e7ab21e7945a56b2fb5)\n\nbut i had hundreds of gulls and quite a few active cormorants to play with. that was fine, i wanted to play with birds in flight anyway.\n\ni tried the z 6ii in wide-area af. i also have my fn1 button set to put the camera into subject tracking mode. these two modes were really all i should need for birds in flight. i'm not much of a back button af person, but it seems to work better in subject tracking mode as the z 6ii's trigger's half-press is pretty short compared to the dslrs i've used over the years.\n\ni was very, very frustrated with subject tracking and the gulls. in this mode, you're presented with a square in the center of the finder that's probably about 9 af points big. when you half-press or back focus af, the white box turns yellow, and whatever is there will be tracked. this generally works pretty well, but i guess my reflexes with that big lens were just too slow. i would just watch the yellow box zip to the right side of the viewfinder as i panned left trying to keep up with the gulls. basically, it got out of the box before the camera could lock on. i feel like i'm 100% blame for this. that lens is big and heavy and those birds were moving... fast... i just couldn't keep that small box on the small bird long enough for it to lock on.\n\nwhen it did catch, it worked pretty well, though trying to follow the yellow box will trick you as it's movement sometimes lags where it's really at. the proof was in the photos. if i got the gull in initial focus, the next few frames (typically a 3-5 frame burst) were also in focus. but more often than not, i wasn't taking photos because i didn't get a lock on.\n\nthe cormorants were quite a bit easier to track, their movement was slower and less chaotic. they tended to fly in straighter lines or bigger arcs. the gulls were pure chaos. the photo below is from a 20 frame burst over 2ish seconds. all of them were in focus.\n\n[cormorants flying in formation. nikon z 6ii + 200-500mm f\\/5.6 @ 500mm.](https://preview.redd.it/ogomunrt49661.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9f2ea47eeb778f83003c1db560ac9260b49f4b)\n\nafter a while, i wasn't getting anything, so i switched over to the d500. i put the 1.4x tc on to see if i could get the down-river eagles. this gave me an effective 1050mm f/8 lens. i tried to track the gulls with this setup as well. i tried both group mode and 3d tracking. the d500 struggled to lock on as well. i suspect it was the tc since it was making the lens f/8 instead of f/5.6. sadly i didn't try taking the tc off to get a speed comparison. but the z 6ii lock-on speed (when i was able to get a lock on) seemed to be as fast as the d500. i didn't get enough of a feel to see if the 3d tracking was able to track better. i suspect it is.\n\ni went back to the z 6ii and the gulls. this time, i didn't mess with subject tracking racking mode. i just let the wide-area af do its thing. for the most part, it found them and kept them in focus. it was able to drive that big lens and reasonably keep up with those randomly moving gulls.\n\n[gull in flight - nikon z 6ii + nikon af-s 200-500mm f\\/5.6 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/ios604te89661.jpg?width=3956&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6a22c3ed3e43b98b1ac243365ab7c109047f6b)\n\naf speed was good enough to track birds in flight. it handled the big lens quite well.  being able to subject track something that's moving chaotically and quickly is hard for me to do. since i wasn't shooting in single af point mode, i was shooting more like 12 fps with the camera. the viewfinder lag (well showing the last shot briefly between frames) is a touch jarring.  \n\ni have no doubt that people will be very successful shooting all kinds of wildlife, though some rapidly, randomly moving birds will be a challenge with subject tracking, though wide-area af should do the trick.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 30811, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 30279, "autor": "_Juaquine", "date": 1597262343000, "content": "Nikon FG Stuck /!/ Hey I just received a Nikon FG as a gift from a grandparent, it's been in it's case for probably 20 years and after taking one photo the mirror locked in the up position.
