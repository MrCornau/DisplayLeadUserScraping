I recently found an insane deal on what I assumed was a Nikon 50mm f/1.4D. Turns out, it was an early AF version of the lens, the Nikon 50mm f/1.4 Non-D, which I have had trouble finding much information about. I got it for $45 alongside a Nikon N6006, but I got it for the lens. Here's the catch: the focus ring was stuck.   \n\n\nNow I've read up on issues like it... \"it's the internal lubricant/it's something stuck in the helicoid/...\". I thought it could be fun to take it apart, fix it, and possible use it myself. But this focus ring was STUCK. It wouldn't move a millimeter left or right. So I managed to disassemble the entire lens, kept the lens group intact (alongside the aperture), however, once I got to the focus system, I realized the issue was not what I expected. The helicoid on the lens group was fine, but the focus ring couldn't move. I watched videos on a the D-version disassembly, and the focus ring was screwed on, but that didn't work. It ended up coming off by prying it off, because it's sort of pressed on rather than screwed on with a thread.   \n\n\nHere is the problem: I disassembled the rest of the focus group, and it's 3 parts: the metal helicoid attached to the focusing gear (sort of the center piece that everything screws into), one plastic ring with the focus distance window, and the actual focus ring. The focus window piece attaches to the metal helicoid easily, it just doesn't have much space to work around to screw it on. But the actual focus ring (a plastic circle, part of which is wider) is supposed to fit into the two other pieces, sort of fitting between the metal and plastic. However, I believe that it is supposed to click onto the metal piece, since there is a raised ridge and a millimeter wide gap. This incorrect position is causing the ring to get stuck by friction, but I also don't know how to \"click it on\" the metal piece, because it would require a lot of force or a tool I don't have.   \n\n\nDoes anyone here have any experience with these older lenses or replacing the actual focus ring (not the rubber piece)? I would love to hear what the trick is to snap it back on, because I have spent hours trying to figure it out, and I've failed dozens of times.   \n\n\nI appreciate any and all information. I have to admit I won't be sending it in for professional repair, because it is simply not worth my money, considering I got a great deal on it, and I wanted to challenge myself. I can sacrifice \\~$30 for overestimating my abilities, not $100+ for fixing a lens that's probably been forgotten for a reason.  Thank you all in advance!  \n\n\nTL;DR: Nikon 50mm f/1.4 AF Non-D focus ring frozen solid. Focus ring won't snap into place. Any help appreciated.

I would like to write this post for people that, in 2019, are looking for information about this lens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fact is: when you google about it, you find mostly two things: the image quality is superb, the autofocus is crap. Unfortunately, this is true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe autofocus of my lens with my old D7100 was bad. Very bad indeed. The next day I bought this camera, I went to the store to purchase the Sigma dock in order to do fine tuning. When I exchanged my camera with the D7200, it was also awful. However, when I reset the configurations, then it was much better than it was initially with D7100. In fact, I achieved an acceptable behavior using the in-camera fine tuning adjustments. Thus, the autofocus quality really depends on your camera and lens.  \n\n\nHowever, after a good fine tuning of the autofocus, what you get is just amazing, because the image quality is superb. In fact, I don't think there is other DX zoom lens with such good quality for Nikon. The process to fine-tuning the lens is painful at best, but you will not regret. What I did was to develop a setup using a cardboard box and a ruler similar to that in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmxtddLfPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmxtddLfPM)   \n\n\nThe process is straightforward: positioning the camera away from the object by one of the distances indicated in the Sigma dock app, take the shots using 18, 24, 28, and 35mm, and check the focus. In all cases, I shot with f1.8. Then, plug the lens into the dock, open the app and adjust. If it is back-focused, then increase the number, otherwise, decrease it. The biggest problem is that, at least for me, the settings were not independent. When I changed the number for, let's say, 24 mm, then the auto-focus behavior using 28mm also changed. Thus, it is a very long try-and-error process that must be repeated for all four distances (0.28m, 0.35m, 0.5m, and infinity) The results for my setup can be seen here: [https://imgur.com/ImMF9Av](https://imgur.com/ImMF9Av)  \n\n\nHere is an example of an image after the calibration process (0.28m, 35mm): [https://imgur.com/6DB57IQ](https://imgur.com/6DB57IQ)   \n\n\nI was not able to verify using the focus at infinity due to my room constraints :D However, in my case, the focus at infinity is very good. After all this process, you realize why this lens is so good. I really would like to do not have to go through all of this, but the image you get after it is just amazing considering the price of it.  \n\n\nWell, I hope this post helps people that want to buy this lens to use in Nikon bodies :)  \n\n\nTL;DR: If you want to buy Sigma 18-35mm to be used in a Nikon body, you would probably need the sigma dock to make micro adjustments in the focus. If you cannot rent it, then buy it!
