Help /!/ Hi There,\n\nI recently just bought a mint condition Nikon D3 with 3500 shutter clicks.\nI cleaned the exterior to remove any possible germs.\nAnd just cleaned The insides: Sensor, mirror, focusing screen on both sides, the interior side when i open the focusing screen. On the outside took out the round eyepiece and i cleaned the first glass piece from the viewfinder. Everything has been cleaned with special optic cleaning fluid + the sterile wipes on the stick (dunnno how you call 'em) + i used the blower at each on of them. I repeated this process twice but i still can see two dark dust spots in the top right corner. I even checked everything before closing in bright LED lamp.\nIts clear that its in the pentaprism. But what do you suggest me to do? I don't wanna send it to a shop, because its a pro body the cost is the same as if I would send a Nikon D5, which is ridiculous for a 10 year old camera.\nIs there any other lens opening?\nPlease let me know! I wanna calm down my \"OCD\"", "autor": "onstageguy", "date": 1514764800000, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/7phsd9/dust_spots_in_my_nikon_d3_viewfinder_cleaned/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": false, "selectorShort": "None", "MarkedSent": "Dust spots in my Nikon D3 viewfinder.
