I also got her a reflector grey card, one of the ones that folds up. \n\nShe is interested in upgrading the camera to a D3300 or D3400 and an expo disc - the card has proven to be difficult to work with in some settings.

She primarily takes photos of children or couples in outdoor settings and I think uses Lightroom for editing. \n\nRight now she is just taking photos of friends and families to learn, for no charge.
