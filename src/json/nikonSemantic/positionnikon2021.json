Previous to this, I had (well still do have) a Tokina 16-28mm f/2.8 cheap f-mount lens that I got several years ago. It flares badly. It's heavy and takes up quite a bit of space in my camera bag.

The other problem is I simply don't \"see\" in ultra-wide-angle. I'm good up to about 20mm. I can envision those photos and I can make fairly good use of the focal length, but for the most part I don't really want to go much past 24mm. On the other hand I \"see\" in telephoto. I like focusing in on the subject. I love to fill the frame. I love macro to get close details.

I still haven't figured out a good place to put it in my bag. I will probably take my 60mm macro out since I mostly use that in studio settings and rarely outside of the house. Like the Z 24-70 f/4, to maintain its compactness it has a \"locked\" off position that you have to rotate the zoom ring to the 14mm position before you can shoot it. Oddly, 14mm is the longest length on the lens, 30mm is its more compact setting. \n\nIt has a very similar build to the Z 24-70 f/4. Both are S-line lenses so it feels well built, but neither are at the level of the Z 70-200 f/2.8 S. Looking through the viewfinder things are clear and bright. Saving over $300 from retail with the referb certainly helped me justify a focal length I struggle with.\n\nSomewhere in my head, I thought \"If I have a lens small enough to carry with me more often, I'll find more opportunities to use it.\" \n\nSo today, I walked out of my home with a Z 6II and the 14-30mm f/4 lens in hand. I promised myself that I absolutely would not take anything else with me. But as I was getting ready, I grabbed the full kit, complete with my D500 \"just in case\" I decided to visit a lake and do some wildlife work while I was out.\n\n[Z 14-30mm f\\/4 at 14mm](https://preview.redd.it/qe9nl504hne71.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79b690cebf883b100a86ab247921368ed14886c5)\n\nIt all started harmless enough. I visited a popular sunflower field. Then I headed to a small \"one block\" big park downtown, and finally to the local arboretum. Only the 14-30 was used until I got to the arboretum. I walked it with the ultra-wide but I just kept seeing \"ooh that would be great with my telephoto\" and \"ooh there are a lot of bees on flowers is great \"light\". I failed myself. I headed back to the car, dumped the wide-angle. Put a 500mm PF on the Z 5II and a 105mm macro on the D500 and went back.\n\nI failed myself.

You can easily find a hyperfocal distance that will have from a few feet all the way to infinity in focus without much effort. This means that you should be able to manually focus with UWA lenses quite well. Like a fool, I depended on the camera to focus for me. That meant I focused close a lot and found I didn't have as much DOF as I expected towards infinity. That was cool, because I actually liked blurring the background in these shots. As much as I have a hard time understanding why at 14mm you would want to shoot at f/2.8 when not shooting the Milky Way, I think I understand now.\n\n[You can see the weird \\\\\"bokeh\\\\\" distortion along the edges in the defocused areas.](https://preview.redd.it/fwszvz1ihne71.jpg?width=6048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8236b955ab75e574d6be2bc55babfb334652ae)\n\nI don't know if it's normal but my \"bokeh\" has a weird quality to it. It kinda looks like a lot of distortion. I wasn't expecting the lens to have a lot based on other photos I've seen and reviews I've read. Maybe it's the subject matter. Maybe it's the angle I'm shooting at, but the edges seem quite odd.\n\nBut in other photos, I took it looks fine. Boy, do I have a lot to learn about this type of shooting.\n\n[Bee Hotel - Z 14-30mm f\\/4 at 14mm f\\/8. My intent was to make the long tubes look like they were sticking out quite a bit more.

I also have a TC-14e III teleconverter.\n\nThe brief quick-test was some basic AF tests and close focus tests. No real photo taking, just getting used to the weight, putting it on the camera or taking it off, focusing near, far and mid-range.\n\nThe first real trip was exclusively with the Z 6II. I went to a local community park where a great blue heron frequents and I can expect mallard ducks and Canadian ring-necked geese. Squirrels and songbirds can be found around as well. There wasn't much in the way of birds-in-flight except for some very small swallows that were moving way to quick and way too small to do anything with. The heron put on a pretty good show.\n\nThe second trip out was with the D500 to our local reservoir's dam. This is a place where birds of prey frequent, feeding off of the concentration of fish below the dam. On a good day, eagles, osprey, hawks, great blue herons, and cormorants can be found. There is usually a lot of activity, both birds and photographers. I got there late, caught one osprey soaring overhead and one great blue heron. \n\nI went back out today, much earlier and it was just as dead. I got a couple of osprey passes, a couple of GBH passes, a bunch of turkey vultures, a black vulture and a couple of other birds. Today, it was a mix of the D500 and the Z 6II.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Great Blue Heron snatching a crawfish, Nikon Z 6II + FTZ + 500mm PF](https://preview.redd.it/9q5xgzdi47y61.jpg?width=3767&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b03e0e7f8a9d966eaa965fa8aa06ee102fa119c5)\n\n**Handling**\n\nThis lens handles like a dream. It's a little lighter than my 70-200  f/2.8 VR II making it quite handholdable. It's longer than the 70-200 f/2.8 but a little shorter than the 200-500 f/5.6 when in the 200mm position. It is also has a much smaller diameter near the camera. It's shaped more like a traditional telephoto with a large front that tapers down to a mount-sized diameter. The 200-500 has a wide diameter throughout its length right up to the mount where it tapers quickly. This makes it much easier to grab the lens, quickly change it and not fear that you're going to drop it. This makes it quite easy to handhold. The natural place to hold the lens is at the focus ring. This lens is quite reasonable.\n\nIt was quite easy to carry around for the 30 minutes to an hour that I was out shooting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Osprey fishing - Nikon Z 6II + FTZ + 500mm PF](https://preview.redd.it/22odq5vd57y61.jpg?width=1868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cba6a2b883369e97d09695df3ec09b7a91944736)\n\n**Autofocus**\n\nIt seems to be quite fast. I don't have a 500 f/4 to compare it to or the 400 /2.8, but it's more than fast enough. It had no problem acquiring birds in flight and keeping up with them. There was a small songbird in a tree with a small branch in front of it. The AF kept wanting to grab on the small branch, then I would raise the camera slightly and it would grab the bird. I don't know why it found that little stubby branch so delicious.  \n\nThe D500 is somewhat faster with AF than the Z 6II, but I didn't really have any difficulties with the Z 6II either. The only issue is that the Z 6II doesn't like to rack from far focus to near-minimum distance without AFing on an intermediate point first. I'm seeing this trend with other lenses. The 300 pf did the same thing. My 200-500 does it. It's frustrating and maybe Nikon can fix this at some point, but like anything, you quickly adapt to it once you know the behavior.\n\nWhile not an \"autofocus\" topic. The close focus distance is around 9.5 feet. You can't quite do \"Macro\" with this, but the Bokeh is oh so creamy. If it would focus closer, you could do some serious \"stand-off\" macro work.\n\n[Creamy Bokeh @ f\\/8? Yup.

The 70-200 is too. I know I'm probably a little more tolerant to less than perfect sharpness because my journalist background is about capturing the moment even if it's not perfect. I don't feel this has the sharpness of my 60mm f/2.8 macro but few lenses will. If the 200-500 is sharp enough, then the 500 PF won't disappoint. It's sharper. It's a prime lens. It should be sharper than a zoom. I've not needed to do any AF fine-tuning.\n\nOn the first trip to the lake, I failed to turn VR off and the photos were softer than I hoped, but I'm panning and moving the lens on purpose which fights the VR. Today, I put it in Sport mode and things were much sharper.\n\nThe images have good color properties and great contrast. I'm quite happy with the results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Northern Cardinal, D500 + 500mm PF](https://preview.redd.it/wfbpek8957y61.jpg?width=3443&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b46ae95f385c0fc9785ef02bd06c627ac0807cd)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs someone who is aging (turned 60 in April) and recovering from a severe illness that claimed a lot of upper body strength, I've been struggling with the weight and bulk of the 200-500. I like to handhold my camera unless I'm going to be shooting for hours and the 200-500 was kicking my tail. I borrowed a 300mm PF and totally fell in love with that lens. It's about everything I would want in a telephoto lens. When paired with the 1.4x and dropped on a crop-sensor camera, I get plenty of reach for most things and I felt it brought life back to my D500 to a point where I would want to use it again. But I shoot a lot of birds and I was concerned the 300mm wouldn't be enough and I really want to use my Z 6II. I believe I'm going to be quite happy with it on the Z 6II.\n\nI will likely end up getting the 300mm PF too. I can see needing something between the 70-200 and the 500mm that's the size of a 24-70 f/2.8. I was concerned about spending $3600 on a lens given that I want to get other lenses and it was a large portion of my camera savings budget. But I certainly am enjoying the lens. The price still stings a bit, but photography is my main source of sanity through the COVID era and this lens will make me quite happy.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/n8soyg/nikon_afs_500mm_f56_pf_review/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "nikon af-s 500mm f/5.6 pf review /!/ i wish i had some better opportunities with the lens, but i think i have a pretty good feel for it. i've taken it out for three birding attempts and a brief quick-test in the backyard.\n\ntl;dr: is the lens worth $3600 + tax?
