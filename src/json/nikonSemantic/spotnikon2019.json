Here's what I gained and lost. /!/ I recently upgraded from a D90...a 10year old camera, which was my first and only DSLR that I have had for 10 years. This is my experience over the past couple months after upgrading.  My perspective is as a historically budget conscious user.\n\n# tl;dr\nThe Z6 is amazing camera and a massive upgrade in so many ways, but I wish there were a few less tradeoffs, especially ones that cost me MORE money after dropping $2300 on the camera body (and adapter).  I was never going to buy a Sony or Canon....but I still have to replace ALL my lenses...so in retrospect, why was I so against that?  I probably could have gotten my top 2 benefits by buying a D7500 without a lot of the tradeoffs including not replacing all my lenses.  Ask me again in a year when I've finished replacing all my lenses.\n\n# Things I Lost After Upgrading\n* No wireless raw transfer to my phone (I had an eyefi type memory card)...this is literally not possible on the Z6.\n* A dead simple (and cheap) wireless shutter trigger (D90 - infrared $12... Z6 uses snap bridge which is still a bit flaky and takes awhile to connect or a  $200 ~~thing~~ WR-R10&amp;WR-T10). \n* Insanely good battery life ...I didn't own a 2nd battery until last year....I would go entire vacations without having to recharge the D90's...The Z6 lasts...a LOT less longer.  I just bought 2 batteries to deal with this.\n* No more AF-A mode (didn't reallllly care, I use back button AF-C 95% of the time)\n* Need to buy new memory card(s)...at $150 each.  (but I got a free one with the purchase of my camera body)\n* No wireless CLS flash system with TTL cause there's no built in flash (need to buy an su-800 or something else to control off camera flashes) (I have an sb-600, an sb-24, and own cactus triggers, so this isn't that big of a loss.)\n* ~~No easy flash compensation control (not even in (i) menu)~~ Nevermind, it's built in to regular exposure compensation.  See setting e3.\n\n# Things I Gained\n## Game Changers:\n* ISO performance is off the charts compared to the D90 which honestly maxed out at 1600 before becoming a complete mess.\n* Awesome auto ISO that's very easy to turn on/off (hold iso button, roll front dial) ...D90's sucked mostly because so much noise even at 800 or 1600. \n* WYSIWYG Mode (settings applied to viewfinder)\n* In.Body.Image.Stabilization!!!  All non-stabilized lenses are now stabilized.  All non-VR lenses (non-screw AF) just got a boost in value.  \n* Can use my dad's M42 mount lenses... awesome. They're manual focus, and the focus peaking is EXTREMELY awesome in helping focus...esp on the 50mm 1.4 that I have. AND they now get IBIS!! \n* Not just usable, but great video capability.  The D90 was the first DSLR with video...and it sucked.  Rolling shutter was horrendous so panning was basically not allowed.  I never took video because of this...I'm excited to use video for, really, the first time ever.\n* Soon to be Eye-AF.  Assuming it works well.\n\n## Also good stuff:\n* Higher image quality\n* Much better metering...D90 feels almost unusable now (maybe I'm exaggerating)\n* LOTS of customizable buttons...but this is almost negated by all the missing dedicated buttons on the D90.  For example, in my current configuration which takes into account the { i } button...which is less good than a dedicated button, I'm losing these buttons in the Z6 - ~~Flash compensation/Flash setting (slow, etc)~~, My Menu, Physical Autofocus/Manual focus switch...but most lenses have that so maybe who cares.\n* On screen level (that i keep forgetting is there, but my landscapes were perpetually off level with D90)\n* Silent mode.  Ever take photos at a baptism in a quiet church? The D90 shutter was like a gunshot.  Z6 is literally 0 noise.  And it can deal with light flicker which is apparently a problem on other mirrorless cameras' silent modes.\n* Built in focus shift shooting (excited to use this...never bothered with D90)\n* Interval timer &amp; Timelapse movie (haven't used....but want to)\n* Face Detection...but it kinda struggles to do what I expect/want sometimes.  (Soon to be eye AF....we'll see)\n* WAY more focus points. D90 had like 12, this has like, infinity.\n\n## I don't care new stuff:\n* Up/down tilty screen (which is sometimes kinda useful...low shots &amp; crowd shots I guess)\n* Prettier/bigger LCD\n* Faster FPS (that I don't use)\n* Insane buffer (that I don't use)\n* On screen histogram...but who cares cause you can see the actual photo before you take it with the WYSIWYG mode\n* Built in HDR -- would rather do in post, doesn't work with RAW anyway\n* Touch screen\n* STAR quality settings for jpg.\n\n# BAD\n## Very Bad:\n* Lightroom automatically applied lens profiles that you can't turn off and thus spot and local image corrections are s...l...o...w.  There's a reason the lens correction is at the bottom of the workflow in Lightroom.\n* My lenses aren't good enough.\n-- My screw type AF lenses don't AF anymore and need to be replaced\n-- My DX lenses (all but the screw one) all make the Z6 have 10mp instead of the 12 I had on D90...literally a downgrade.  They technically work, but why.\n-- My Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 has a bug that causes it to keep the IBIS on 100% of the time which kills the entire battery in like 1.5hrs. I THINK it's even on when the camera is off?  Haven't fully tested, but my battery has gone down with that lens on and charging through the USB-C cable\n* DUST!  I literally never got dust on my D90 sensor.  Z6 has had it almost every time I shoot.  Cleaning needs become a ritual.\n\n## Just Annoying: \n* U1/U2/U3 settings (that I don't use and screwed me into taking a ton of small jpgs instead of raw once)\nable. okok, I should learn to use them...they seem pretty cool.\n* Compared to the D90, it's SO. SLOW. to turn on after going to sleep.  It might be 1 second, but feels like forever.\n* Bad situation with the FTZ adapter and tripods.  Normal plates struggle to fit on the camera when FTZ is there, so if you're switching between Z and F mount lenses, you maybe have to have 2 plates ...one attached to the FTZ, and one directly on the camera.  OR you could keep moving the plate...ew.  \n* Lenses are expensive....kit lens is $900 if you didn't get the kit (like my dumb self)\n* Z mount prime lenses are big...1.5 - 2.x the size of their F mount equivalent.  \n\n## Disappointingly Break Even:\nWeight.  The D90 weighs almost exactly the same as the Z6 with the FTZ adapter.  oh well.\n\n\nHopefully I don't sound too ungrateful here.  My intention is to illustrate some of the tradeoffs when switching from a DSLR to mirrorless, and also from switching from a amateur level to a pro level (or at least near-pro).
