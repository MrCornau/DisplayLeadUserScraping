Which would you recommend to pair with D750? /!/ Hi fellow Nikonians,\n\nI am looking to get a sharp wide/semi-wide lens (either the 20mm or 35mm Sigma Art F/1.4 ) since these provide excellent image quality and would be really useful for my street/landscape photography.  If it helps, my current gear is:\n\nD3300\nD750\n18-55 &amp; 55-200 DX VR 2\n50mm F/1.8G\n85mm F/1.8G\n24-120mm F/4 VR\nManfrotto Element Tripod\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Does anyone know how much resolution I would lose if I were to try to crop the 20mm into effectively what is a 35mm frame if 20mm is shot at 6000x4000\n\nOver the weekend I was shooting with my 24-120 F/4 (kit lens) and took a couple decent shots at 24mm but then I zoomed in a bit further and realized 35 was providing more of the shot I wanted, but that's likely because of where my location was relative to what I was shooting (city scape long exposure photography over NYC). I've never shot at 20mm (I used to have an effective 27mm as my widest on the D3300 and the 24 on D750) but I imagine that if I do, I will likely be cropping in a fair amount of the time to make sure the image is composed to be as interesting as possible) so I want to check to see if I'm going to lose too much resolution, especially if I end up cropping down to something that looks like it could have been shot on a 35mm lens. I know I can do some testing with this with my 24, but i won't get an accurate estimate for comparison sake of how much the resolution would drop from 20 to 35mm cropping in post. I do care about printing, and want to be able to print large enough, so resolution does matter in that sense.\n\n2. What do you guys prefer? Or do you recommend going with the 18-35 Sigma F1.8?\n\nI understand the difference in FoV, but I just can't justify buying both.  I'm leaning toward the 20mm since it'll expand my focal range, is almost just as good as the 35mm in terms of quality (36 on DxO v. 39 for the 35mm), but I do shoot more street photography than anything else living in NYC, so 35mm seems like it might be the sweet spot, although I do have 35mm covered at F/4 (though nowhere near as sharp).  35mm can also be better for group/single portraits I think, whereas 20mm especially at 1.4 can be good for astrophotography. I'm not too crazy on getting a zoom since I really prefer the image quality primes provide - But that's why I'm interested to hear some real world examples of what people have used and prefer!  \n\nAgain I'm leaning toward 20mm since it'll expand my focal range, allow me to take better astrophotography shots (I want to be able to capture more of the scene is all, though I have yet to start AP!), and I can always crop into the image if I don't want to keep the entire shot at 20mm but please let me know what you think!\n\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/95eq3c/sigma_14_hsm_art_20mm_v_35mm_which_would_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "sigma 1.4 hsm art 20mm v 35mm? which would you recommend to pair with d750? /!/ hi fellow nikonians,\n\ni am looking to get a sharp wide/semi-wide lens (either the 20mm or 35mm sigma art f/1.4 ) since these provide excellent image quality and would be really useful for my street/landscape photography.  if it helps, my current gear is:\n\nd3300\nd750\n18-55 &amp; 55-200 dx vr 2\n50mm f/1.8g\n85mm f/1.8g\n24-120mm f/4 vr\nmanfrotto element tripod\n\nmy questions are:\n\n1. does anyone know how much resolution i would lose if i were to try to crop the 20mm into effectively what is a 35mm frame if 20mm is shot at 6000x4000\n\nover the weekend i was shooting with my 24-120 f/4 (kit lens) and took a couple decent shots at 24mm but then i zoomed in a bit further and realized 35 was providing more of the shot i wanted, but that's likely because of where my -----> location !!!  was relative to what i was shooting (city scape long exposure photography over nyc). i've never shot at 20mm (i used to have an effective 27mm as my widest on the d3300 and the 24 on d750) but i imagine that if i do, i will likely be cropping in a fair amount of the time to make sure the image is composed to be as interesting as possible) so i want to check to see if i'm going to lose too much resolution, especially if i end up cropping down to something that looks like it could have been shot on a 35mm lens. i know i can do some testing with this with my 24, but i won't get an accurate estimate for comparison sake of how much the resolution would drop from 20 to 35mm cropping in post. i do care about printing, and want to be able to print large enough, so resolution does matter in that sense.\n\n2. what do you guys prefer? or do you recommend going with the 18-35 sigma f1.8?\n\ni understand the difference in fov, but i just can't justify buying both.  i'm leaning toward the 20mm since it'll expand my focal range, is almost just as good as the 35mm in terms of quality (36 on dxo v. 39 for the 35mm), but i do shoot more street photography than anything else living in nyc, so 35mm seems like it might be the sweet spot, although i do have 35mm covered at f/4 (though nowhere near as sharp).  35mm can also be better for group/single portraits i think, whereas 20mm especially at 1.4 can be good for astrophotography. i'm not too crazy on getting a zoom since i really prefer the image quality primes provide - but that's why i'm interested to hear some real world examples of what people have used and prefer!  \n\nagain i'm leaning toward 20mm since it'll expand my focal range, allow me to take better astrophotography shots (i want to be able to capture more of the scene is all, though i have yet to start ap!), and i can always crop into the image if i don't want to keep the entire shot at 20mm but please let me know what you think!\n\n\nthanks in advance!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 45952, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 250800, "autor": "fromwentzhecame11", "date": 1540224810000, "content": "D7200, New Portrait Lens? /!/ As the title says, I have a D7200 and I mainly take portraits.
