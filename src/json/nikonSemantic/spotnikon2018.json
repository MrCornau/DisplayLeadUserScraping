First post on here and was actually quite happy to see how active this subreddit is!\n\nI've recently made a very big upgrade from a Nikon D90 that I bought brand new 9 years ago up to the full-frame FX D800 camera body. The D90 has served me VERY well over the past 9 years but I figured if there was any time to upgrade, now was the best time!\n\nA big reason for the upgrade as well is because I was selling off a guitar I had and the guy helped \"pay\" for the guitar with a **Sigma 24-35mm f/2 DG Art lens**. I had already been thinking about upgrading my camera body for a while but now I felt like I was committed. \n\nSo that leaves me in a very weird spot...because I realize the focal range I get is *pretty short* and I know most guys go for a 24-70 for the versatility. And I've been looking through a ton of lenses and still don't have much of a clue on what would probably be my best bet. Another major thing is that many of the lenses I used for my D90 are for an APS-C sensor so I'm basically starting from scratch which is fine with me. I'll be selling those in the near future. \n\nMy budget is probably up to $500 max.
