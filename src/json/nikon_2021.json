The moment there is direct light, that sort of high contrast, the Z6II focuses fine, but in dim conditions it really struggles.\n\nThe only way I can get similar AF in dim light conditions is if I set the Z6II to Auto-Area AF, In that case it seems to perform fine. D800 focus is still a teeeeny bit better, but at least it isn't day and night.  \n\n\nThat said, Auto-Area AF is not something I can use.
