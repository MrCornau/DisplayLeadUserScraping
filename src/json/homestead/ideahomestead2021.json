It had been an incredibly hot day and I figured, despite my cooling measures, heatstroke had claimed him. No obvious signs of illness but I didn't check him over as thoroughly as I should have. He was in a rabbit tractor with fresh grass and water when he passed. \n\nNot long after, as I was on high alert, I noticed my other Flemish buck Camie seemed sluggish. I quarantined him but he was noticeably worst the next morning. He had lost weight and his fur seemed dull. Still eating and drinking though. He died a day later after I noticed his balance was off. \n\nThree days ago, I noticed my Californian buck had lost weight. I got him quarantined and he seemed to be doing ok. He was eating, active, and pooping normally. Just acting like his normal self. When I got home today, I found him on his side unable to balance himself. He died a few hours later. \n\nAll of my does seem to be in perfect health. I feed all my rabbits a mix of pellets, fresh greens from the garden, and Timothy hay.
