      "content": "Dsalamena, To answer your question in your post #87, the M10 and M10-R color are very similar but not identical. At lower ISO the M10 files are cleaner for noise. But for resolution and at higher ISO the M10-R is better. If you consistently make large prints, consider the M10-R, if not, the M10 works just fine. If you want a excellent review comparison for the M10 and M10-R cameras, I recommend you subscribe to Reid Reviews and you can make an informed decision vs taking my word for it. Both cameras are superb, -----> -----> I !!!  create !!!  very large prints for my clients and therefore need the M10-R. Before that, the M10-P worked almost as well for me. Hope this helps. r/ Mark Edited August 11, 2020 by LeicaR10",

      "content": "Just now, lct said: Why using the L mount for manual lenses anyway? There are SL and CL cameras for that. Never understood good people stating they preferred the L mount because... i don't remember why exactly sorry. More modern perhaps? Unless it was because they heard it at Leica, so if they changed their mind it could mean that Leica changed their mind as well... Who knows? . Totally agree and fingers crossed that the softened stance of the inside man on this thread is indeed a positive indicator of things to come. Once you land on L-mount as the native interface to the glass, IMO, everything spirals out of control. It would be impossible from a marketing standpoint not to include AF and all that entails. No aperture ring means another dial. What no AE-F lock control? Forced to add an adapter straight out of the box that costs how much?!? As you so correctly point out, we have the CL, SL, SL2, SL-S not to mention all the Panos and Sigma for L. I get that there are some folks out there that want a FF mini-SL, but that has nothing to do with what both you, I and others have been on about for several years now. This isn't to say that if -----> -----> we !!!  -----> we !!! re designing !!!  a 21st C. MF only camera from scratch, -----> we !!!  couldn't do better than the exist 70 year old mount as Jaapv points out. But we are, happily, captive to all those decades of lens production and frankly, having a stripped down, lower cost, EVF based body totally focused on that library of lenses is, IMO, an important notion if not simply for those of desirous of it, but for ensuring the survival of the M itself.",

But I get your point. Given there have been hundreds of pages devoted to the topic in this forum, its well understood that some, maybe most, see the letter M as exclusively belonging to an RF design. While I get this point of view, its not one I hold, no matter how heretical it might be. While I appreciate the attributes of the RF, I'd would never have come to Leica... from Fuji among others... had it not been for the glass and rendering. -----> I !!!  shot exclusively with the OVF for about a year after which -----> -----> I !!!  developed !!!  a hybrid technique which utilizes both. To my mind, M stands for the mount, not the method of focus, given Leica produced RFs for decades prior to the M designation. But either belief is really beside the point. For those who find EVF to be a useful tool and have a significant investment in M glass, having a small form factor minimalist EVF designed specifically to utilize our current set of optics is something quite logical, regardless of the model designation.",

      "content": "Steven, Although I went from M10-R back to the M10-P for my aforementioned reasons in my post #555...from what I learned recently from a source the next camera will benefit from a BSI type sensor like the SL2-S. IMO, meaning the M11 could well have the look and feel like the SL2-S for low light rendering capability, color and hopefully a more cinematic look. It might well have a solution for selective option for DNG output for different levels of DNG MPs...similar to the option in given with JPEGs. This would be a great move for Leica with an excellent sensor and selectable MP for DNGs. For those of us who do not need 40 MPs, we can perhaps select 24 MPs. In my business, I can easily print 6 ft x 4 ft prints from a 24 MP sensor that renders the level of detail that at times can be more than amazing and my clients vote with their wallets. It would be great to know a M11 delivers selective levels of MPs. So we will just have to wait and see. For me, 24 MPs is the sweet spot for creating photographs that ultimately meet my goal that causes the viewer to: Stop, Look, Think and Feel something about that moment in time. -----> I !!! f -----> -----> I !!!  can create !!!  a photograph that accomplishes this goal...then -----> I !!!  am more than pleased. r/ Mark Edited October 6 by LeicaR10",

However, my vertical alignment is also off so there are always 2 stars in the focusing patch no matter what I do, making adjustment very difficult. At the end of all that, the rangefinder does not coincide at infinity, but focus from 0.7m - 5m seems to be accurate (still slightly front focusing but acceptable) for Summilux-M 50mm at F1.4. I have a few questions regarding the adjustments. Horizontal adjustment (please kindly see attached photo from the internet, of an M7?) When the hex key is inserted into the hole, and clockwise turns (red arrow) are very easy and the rangefinder arm does not move at all. However, when I try to turn anti-clockwise (green arrow) the rangefinder arm pivots down into the body with the turn, so I had to do a lifting motion whilst also turning the hex key. This lifted the rangefinder arm further out of the body once, but it then moved back so I am not sure whether this will cause any problems in the long term. I made sure not to press the rangefinder arm in the direction of the top plate and it looks the same as far as I can tell. Hopefully I didn't bend it? Vertical adjustment Apparently this can also be done with the 2mm hex key. However, I have no idea how to unscrew the cover screw on the camera without scratching it.

The Summilux 50 asph is known for calibration issues, due to the exceedingly tight tolerances in the floating element mechanism. If the problem is with the lens you can find out by mounting a lens with known correct calibration. OTOH, the adjustment of the rangefinder is basically done at two places, the roller wheel and the internal screw of the arm. The roller wheel is for infinity and can be done in -----> -----> DIY !!!  !!! . The screw is for close-up and is slightly more difficult. It may be that Leica only adjusted infinity. There is also the possibility that you bent the arm slightly by hitting the roller when mounting a lens. In that case the mid-range will be off.

I\u00b4d like to have a camera with me, that would not have me thinking about whether I should ride the stumpy trail or not, because of the fear that it could damage the camera or may have the rangefinder to be re-adjusted. Does someone have experience with that, or would you recommend another camera for that use? Maybe a little compact one with a big sensor? The M240 (and M10) are more shock-resistant than previous models, due to an improved rangefinder mechanism. I would be surprised to see an M240 knocked out of kilter by anything less than an impact that would leave some other brands a collection of nuts,bolts and shards of plastic. Even older M cameras were pretty bomb-proof, although a really hard slam on the bottom plate could shift the vertical RF adjustment, as could really strong vibration - this was the improvement on the 240, making the shift near-impossible.

      "content": " 10 hours ago, chasdfg said: For every camera I purchase I have one spare battery, maybe two spares if the battery life is notoriously poor (think early sony MILCs). What I've learnt is that two healthy batteries stored properly and used evenly in rotation is better than a stockpile of 4 or 5 (or more) batteries which are unused. I've purchased cameras used with up to 6 batteries \"free\", but the extra batteries count for nothing if they are all dead. I shot my M240 rather heavily for almost 5 years and two batteries served me fine (over 30-40k frames?) with no discernible drop in battery life. Anyway, the camera will likely die before the original two batteries (one with the camera and spare) truly go kaput, if the batteries maintained through the lifetime (rotated for use, stored properly, not dropped). Now Leica product cycles are 4 to 5 years, so at the tail end of those cycles you may wish to pick up another couple of batteries lest the new model uses a newer battery type. I do recall camera companies generally extending serviceability of a camera 5 to 10 years after the camera is discontinued (depending on manufacturer), in which case even if a new model is released with new batteries, the older model's batteries should continue to be sold until the camera is no longer serviceable. If the new model uses the same batteries, then you're in luck. Now I myself have overthought this. Basically 2 batteries for me. Another 1 or 2 every 5 years if I stick with that camera.

Better yet, it may be possible to buy the most up to date technology (remember the battery memory in the old technology?).

I have not found the source of replace/refill cell yet, but that would be a good choice. Perhaps solve the problem once and forever. Sounds like a lot of trouble for a $100 battery. I explored swapping batteries out of my electric toothbrush, but swapping cells out of a camera battery...I'd say its safer to buy a used one (of which you do not know the provenance i.e. may have been dropped or charged improperly) than to muck about like that and brick a camera. It isn't impossible and it may be a simple job if you know what you're doing but most of us don't in this respect. In any case if you do find out where Varta Indonesia gets the cells and circuits of this battery and decide to embark on this project I'd follow with interest..",

I don't find myself in such situations very often, but even beyond that it's simply unimportant to me that every possible photo I point my camera to capture has to be good. There are an infinity of photo opportunities in the world. I'm content to enjoy the ones I attempt that work out as I envisioned. Handling the SL and then picking up the M-P, I would very much appreciate the additional room for my fingers on the camera that the M-D affords. G A digital camera is certainly a benefit to quickly check if you get what you wanted. I need this for landscape images. But for street photography I have found out in my own experience what this can become a nuisance because I then begin to rely on the LCD and then change my style of shooting images, on the fly. I instantly get fustrated when I see that i did not get the image I wanted to, on the LCD and this disrupts my further image shooting instead on concentrating on take the next photo. I've stopped taking images wide open and I now stop down as much as I can in street photography(and family photos). I now concentrate on content instead of bokeh and this has really openned up a new world for me. Shooting analogue Leica MP is, in many ways, a relief. I disconnect my self from the instantaneous age. We want everything instantaneous. With analogue -----> I !!!  accept -----> I !!!  cannot see what -----> I !!! 've shot and -----> -----> I !!!  develope !!!  and scan months after -----> I !!!  taken the image. This really helps me to visualise and concentrate how to take a photograph and the next photo.

When I did use M lenses on the SL2, I did not stop down below f/8 for highest resolution, only when I needed more DOF. BTW, I sold the SL2 system and now only use the M10-M + R and S3 systems. My business requires that I photograph landscapes in very remote and often environmentally harsh conditions. The S3 does the bulk of my work for very large and detailed print requirements from my clients. Only when I am challenged by the remoteness of the hike do I take the M cameras. In all cases, it gets down to your personal tastes and expectations what your genre of photography and how you want to create your photographs. I hope this helps. r/ Mark",

According to the only factory manual I have (easily found on the internet), the thing is a bending tool and its purpose is to adjust the rangefinder by bending the arm. All that Jaap got wrong is precisely what this adjustment is for. In order for all lenses to couple accurately with the rangefinder, the axis of the roller cam must be precisely parallel with the axis of the shaft at the other end of the arm. If it isn't, there are two possible sources of inaccuracy, though I don't know which is more important. One is that as the arm rotates, the angle the roller presents to the rangefinder cam on the lens will change; the other is that the coupling will be different depending on the vertical position at which each lens's rangefinder cam contacts the roller. If the roller is exactly parallel with the shaft at the other end, both those factors are irrelevant. The official use of the bending tool is in conjunction with a special 3-position gauge that mimics a lens focused at 10m distance whose cam contacts the roller at top, centre and bottom of the roller's width. If the rangefinder image remains stationary as the gauge is moved between its three positions, this adjustment is correct. If it moves, the bending tool must be used. Clearly this is (a) unlikely to go out of adjustment in normal use and (--img--  not something one can adjust without a special gauge, so it's outside the scope of -----> -----> DIY !!!  !!!  rangefinder adjustment. I have no idea whether or not the bending tool is also useful when adjusting the arm length and roller cam. My source is the official Repair Training Program manual for \"Camera Set, Still Picture KS-15(4)\", a US military version of the M2 with M4 rapid loading takeup spool. The arm on my M8 looks exactly the same as the one in the diagrams in this manual. FWIW there are a total of five adjustment points in this part of the rangefinder, although only the two Julian has explored are likely to be needed in ordinary DIY work.",

I was afraid about pivots, arms etc. but I came across this: \"fixing lateral rangefinder misalignment is, most of the time, simply adjusting the roller for infinite and everything falls in place...\", or something like that. Using the 2mm wrench, it only took a few very small torsions applied to the roller's hex screw in both directions to have my 50 and 90 Summicrons aligning the images at infinite again. Taking pictures of objects at different distances at f/2 showed that the infinite adjustment was all my camera needed for other distances. No back or front focus so far, at least with those lenses. I was afraid I could screw up something, but it was very direct and simple, actually. I decided no to go to the vertical alignment at this time, since it is very small. Cheers",

      "content": "R: Brian \"CCD's are much more sensitive to IR than a CMOS sensor, roughly 10x. \" Nope. 100% wrong there. Both made of silicon. CCD's a cheaper to make than CMOS but use more power than CCD and have slower readouts. Early CMOS sensors used a lot of the sensor space for the circuits so pixel size was smaller which means noise was greater (smaller photon wells = less dynamic range). CMOS sensors cost more to design but are less expensive in the long run. For a long time now, when you look at the chip under a microscope, you can see the pixels are edge-to-edge. And with Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors, now even more so. When you buy glass from Schott (and I do), you can specify, within reason, whatever thickness you want. If Leica/Kodak/Truesense/On Semi wanted to by 0.5mm glass, it isn't a problem. And they could have easily added coatings to change the UV and IR response. It's not that big of a deal. Plenty of companies that offer coating services and you can model some pretty complex response curves. And if they had added the coatings, they wouldn't have had the 'corrosion'. Maybe the datasheet specified coatings, but, at least for a lot of cameras, the coatings aren't there. We were the first company that figured out how to re-purpose a consumer camera for vegetation remote sensing by making a filter that passed plant absorption (blue or red light) to one color channel and a plant reflection channel (NIR) to another color channel. Plants reflect the NIR because the longer, lower energy wavelengths don't have enough energy to support photosynthesis. So if you look at how a plant is absorbing and reflecting light, you can determine things like biomass, plant health, etc. We also knew how to measure the camera spectral response so we knew how the RGB channels opened and close in the visible and NIR. It turns out that the red channel is open in the red and stay open throughout the NIR while the blue and green channels don't open up until around 800nm. So -----> -----> we !!!  designed !!!  a filter that passed visible blue and green light, blocked red light, passed NIR from 680nm to 800nm and then blocked light above 800nm - and that was one filter on one piece of glass. That way, only the red channel saw NIR. Once you had a picture with that information, you could run the picture through a computer program to calculate things like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).",

      "content": " 49 minutes ago, jaapv said: Which would not be a problem - The user would need to use IR cut filters in front of the lens, which is no hardship. The only drawback would be the need to use flat field correction for certain WA lenses. We've used Hot Mirror filters for years, with our M8 and with some lenses on the M9. I have about 12 of them. The M8 drew much criticism over the need for external filters and the IR problem. Leica/ONSEMI avoided this completely by using BG55 glass, which is much more stable environmentally than S8612. The protective coating of the S8612 as used in the M9 did not stand up to the job of preventing corrosion. Dan claims that the Data Sheets published for years, revised a few times- are all wrong- that the M9 sensor's cover glass has no protective coating at all. If that had been the case, as per the S8612 Data Sheet- the corrosion problem would have been much worse than it was. Schott states that unprotected S8612 glass will corrode after a few months. My M9 went 7 years. Dan's article on MaxMax labeling Kodak and Leica as \"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid\" does not identify the glass, which is specified in the Datasheet. The Data Sheet also states that the cover glass is provided by Schott, and the performance of the cover glass in the Data Sheet is from Schott. I believe the Data Sheets from Schott and Kodak/TrueSense/ONSEMI. I work with groups that make custom glass, and make custom sensors. To state that silicon sensors are all the same was just way too much. A couple of years ago one of my coworkers needed to make a low-cost VNIR sensor, I went through the data sheets for a number of CMOS and CCD COTS sensors. The IR had been bred out of the CMOS sensors of the time, Hamamatsu CCD's had 10dB higher sensitivity in the IR. All were Silicon sensors. Same with ONSEMI CCD's without IR absorbing glass, better IR- but the emphasis had been placed on Visible. The spectral response of my DCS200ir is about the same in IR as Visible. Kodak started using Indium Tin Oxide to extend blue response. Once again- follow a technology for 40 years, you pick up some things. I hack lenses, known for converting Sonnars to Leica mount and adjusting Jupiters. That's lens hacking for relaxation.From working in an Optical Research Lab for over 40 years. -----> I !!! 'm a Lens Hacker, but had two optical engineers work for -----> me to design !!!  the real stuff. Kodak came to us for IR technology back in the 80s. Seemed fair that I give them a call in 2009 and ask for a Monochrome M9. I actually asked for a full-spectrum M9, told them I'd buy 6 of them. It would have been under $50K for all of them. Way cheaper than Sensors Unlimited stuff. The Kodak Engineer told me that had a meeting with Leica coming up, and they would discuss it. Kodak had wanted to do a Monochrome M8 to pick up where the DCS760m had failed- due to a banding problem. Preaching to the choir. Once I got the M Monochrom, I had to get the shim for an F1.5 J-3 and Sonnar within 0.01mm. I have about 20 5cm F1.5 Sonnars and J-3's in my collection. Past 100 lenses in Leica mount now. For the M Monochrom: the shims are optimized for different color filters. Deep color filters shift the focus towards infinity, enough to have to adjust the shim. 0.1mm is far off for a lens. I no longer do lens work- Skyllaney in the UK offers the service professionally. Gone are the days that I'd convert a Sonnar to Leica mount for $25 and left-over parts. Some of those Sonnars that I converted sell for a lot these days. All a clever plan to shoot with and take apart hundreds of lenses. Edited September 16, 2020 by BrianS",

It just has the appearance of lackluster customer support no matter how you characterize it. Perhaps I expect too much from Wetzlar. As manufacturers of what is purported to not only be the first small camera but also the best this seems to me to be inappropriate. But, as I say, I must be mistaken and unable to appreciate the complexities of the manufacture, sale and support of 35mm format cameras. I am hopeful that sometime soon the company can overcome its fragility and become able to make and repair cameras to a higher degree than now. I'd hope that Wetzlar's fifteen years in the digital business will be a substantial foundation for future successes and stability. Yes, one can only hope. Perhaps they can borrow from the electro-optical knowledge of the microscope division which is quite sophisticated and under the same roof. In the meantime fortunately there is competent after-market repair available to solve the disappointments of limited factory support.",

That works. I use 35mm Summilux pre-ASPH coding/profile for the very-similar 35 f/1.4 Nokton I/II, and it looks great. One can also \"zero in\" on the best profile by trying ALL the menu options for a given focal length, and seeing if any one is noticably better. It should be noted that the only profiled correction done in-camera is for corner color stains and/or some vignetting, mostly with <50mm lenses. Distortion and such are not corrected by the camera - but having the lens type listed in the EXIF data allows post-processing software (PS/LR, C1, DxO) to make additional corrections (e.g. distortion, color aberrations). Note also that C/V lenses (and some Zeiss ZMs) can be coded semi-permanently with black pen/paint - unlike Leica's lenses, they have a recessed channel machined into the rear face of the lens mount that will prevent -----> -----> DIY !!!  !!!  coding from being rubbed off with use.",

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, for sure, but I cannot recreate the \"look\" I have come to prefer from the source files of the M240. I find this most pronounced in pictures of people which is my most frequent and preferred subject matter. Others might not agree and might prefer the files they are getting or might think a compromise was needed to gain other advantages they needed or wanted.. Perhaps someone has a \u201csecret sauce\u201d in post processing that has not yet been shared and demonstrated\u2026.which may in fact be proprietary. Okay\u2026.but it has eluded me and has eluded others and not for want of trying. While I do not \u201clike\u201d change as much as I wish I did, this has never stopped me from pursuing and embracing it. -----> I !!!  think the M240 has great versatility and wonderful features as a camera but something changed not for the better for me in terms of the images -----> -----> I !!!  can create !!!  with it. I hoped that the letter would continue a positive, informed discussion not only among photographers/customers but also with representatives from Leica, too. I would never discourage someone's success or satisfaction with the tools, features, and, ultimately, images they prefer. In fact, I like to celebrate that. Peter, personally, deserves more credibility and respect for his findings than some of the responses that have been posted here exhibit. His work is astonishingly good and he has devoted a great deal of time and open-minded experimentation to this effort. I agree with the letter (that's why I signed it) and share an interest in further developing the CCD sensor technology\u2026or frankly, any technology, that creates files I can turn into the kinds of images I have come to treasure from the M9 (and the M8) with their CCD sensors. For those of you for whom the CMOS sensor is giving you preferred imagery? Wonderful. Does this mean that it is giving everyone preferred imagery? No. Does it mean that one can seamlessly \"convert\" a CMOS file into one that emerged from a CCD sensor? No, it doesn't. At least in many images where the differences matter most. Hence the letter. Thank you to those who have responded with courtesy, knowledge, helpfulness, and experience regardless of your \u201cpoint of view\u201d. We all learn and grow from this. For those who have chosen to post rude and misguidedly speculative posts? Well, I guess we learn something from that, too (albeit not about cameras, photography, or image creation).",

My Open Letter to Leica has garnered over 400 signatures by discerning photographers, artists, and general photo enthusiasts. Please Leica, keep CCD alive. \u2014Peter. First of all, thank you for this initiative. Leica will certainly read this and act accordingly. They have listened to this forum many times. Not alway with the expected results but they have a business to attend. Second; I have enjoyed the M9 with ccd very much. Still the decision to go to the M was one of better iso. Not better colours. With the M9 I just hadn't enough light to make the picture I wanted. I also noticed that I did not took so many colour photographs with the M9 because of the limitations I felt, or wasn't able to correct properly ( my fault ) or I did not wanted to spent time on it. With the M 240 I don't feel this problem any more. I took the liberty of comparing some of my shots. -----> I !!!  also see a difference in the way -----> -----> I !!!  develope !!!  my M 240 files. Maybe because it's more flexible. I also notice that I use different colour choises. I do not really know if it's impossible to get the same results/colour, at the same time with the two different camera's because I was never in that position. I do know that my colour choice has changed in time. Maybe because of this camera and its possibilities. See: M 9: Affligem kleur - pauljoostenfotograaf Duik 15 mei 2013 Oostplas. Tilburg.

As a matter of fact, I have shot with a DP Merrill: http://prosophos.com/2015/01/13/paranoid-android/ The colours out of that camera are a little wonky, and the ISO limitations more prounounced, relative to the M9 CCD. So I agree, right now, the Merrills have even more limitations. But the detail!... leaves you breathless. Still, that darn CCD sensor still offers the best combination of colours, micro-contrast, and tonality I've ever encountered (and these days, I photograph with a Nikon D810).",

I can see no other drawbacks, but I can change this. Dead pixels, hot pixels can and will be fixed so I advise you to not delete the RAW+JPG pairs yet. --img--  As of now there have not been any surprising issues for me that I wasn't aware of. I was mainly focusing on the color cast but seems like some sort of pixel fixing is on your wishlist. I have two main issues here: 1.) anyone got an idea on how to acquire a test image where the defects nicely and reliably show? 2.) I do not like the idea of having to create a GUI driven pixel fixer because that'd be a whole project of its own, especially as I'm supporting Windows, Mac & Linux. SO i guess it'll be something like \"open the DNG in a viewer, look for coordinates of defect pixels and put them in a file named like your m8 serial or something similar. Cool thing would be you wouldn't have to send the camera to Solms if a new defect appears... But as I said I couldn't take a photo yet where it really shows so advice is needed. I am surprised that you are happy with ISO results as I exclusively shoot at 160. I have to write the article to explain things... Last I want to mention that Brian at leicaplace.com has done some similar tests and was also quite content. I invite you to post images where an improvement is seen as there are many sceptics that have to see proofs rather than testing it for themselves... Especially since the acquisition of an image is a little more complicated. Btw does the longer write time bother you? last: keep the bia file please for now. it's the black image acquisition and is taken for shutter speeds longer than 1/15s or so. I don't use it yet. If you want to explore the content, rename the bia to raw and run it through the converter (using the same jpg) Have fun and share the information! Arvid",

Copy the files from the m8raw2dngv12beta_mac folder into the newly created m8raw2dng folder. Now we must tell the droplet where to find the m8raw2dng executable. 1.

This says: set TheApp to \"/Applications/m8raw2dng\" This tells the droplet that the m8raw2dng executable is in /Applications We put in the current user's directory so we change the line to: set TheApp to \"~/m8raw2dng/m8raw2dng\" (keep the tab in front of the line) (on unix systems the ~ is the path to the current user's home directory) 3. Save the file Next we must set the parameters. The most important being the output location (where to put the newly created DNG files). 1. Go to your Pictures folder 2. Create a folder called: m8raw (A different name is possible, if so change the following to reflect your folder's name) 3. Open the main.scpt in the droplet as before 4. Go to line 11. It says: set Params to \" -v -r -b -p -l -o /Users/YourName/Pictures\" This tells the droplet with which parameters it should run the m8raw2dng. For a full description go to: M8raw2dng \u2013 Tool to convert Leica M8 RAW files to DNG The most important one is the -o It sets the output directory. Change the line to: set Params to \" -v -r -b -p -l -o ~/Pictures/m8raw\" (change the path if you chose a different location / name) 5. Save the file Now your droplet is ready to be used. Drag a folder of RAW and JPG files on top of the droplet and it should output the resulting DNG files in your ~/Pictures/m8raw folder. You will probably find the resulting DNG files are magenta coloured and uneven. We can fix this later",

      "content": "Hi BigLouis. Thank you for the feedback and I've tried to take in your comments with an open mind. But is my thinking flawed that I should expect the focus be within the DoF even at f/1.1 after testing it on a tripod to mitigate any sort of unsteadiness on my part? And even when stopped down to f/4, the focus is off. I've also noticed that the further away the subject is, the more it back focuses. I had sent DAG an email and I am told that he can not adjust it because of it's design. I've not yet heard back from Stephan Gandy. But at any rate, thanks for taking the time to respond. -Norm You are expecting too much from this lens. I owned one and it was a competent lens but too close to my Nokton 1.5 which I preferred.

Do you know of other manufacturers that make CCD-specific ADC/AFE devices? On a side note, I still have some doubts that it is in fact true 16-bit - seems suspicious that Leica designed in a 16-bit ADC but it only outputs 8-bit RAW files. I suspect that Mark is right, and the ADC is actually only 14-bits. Regarding timing generation, it is possible that the ADC/AFE device could generate the timing - many of the Analog Devices AD99xx AFE parts have integrated timing generators. Mark, I certainly wouldn't have wanted to desolder the CCD either... they are notoriously static-sensitive, and I doubt you can get a replacement sensor at a reasonable price! p.s. anyone know what happened to Huw Finney and his -----> -----> DIY !!!  !!!  digital Leica M2?

      "content": "And standard parts are easier to repair, even after years.... Mark, firstly a wonderful piece of work and I thank you most sincerely for sharing it with us. Was interested in the comments about 'standard components' being used. In my non-photographic life, I'm involve with the repair of composite structures on new generation aircraft. We build a piece of electronic equipment specifically for the process. Two of the circuit boards are designed and built just for our application, but for the remainder we use 'standard components'. What we find is that 'standard components' in the electronics industry usually only have a five year life expectancy. (I mean availabilty, not working life.) As when -----> -----> we !!!  designed !!!  the equipment -----> we !!!  didn't know where each individual component was in it's 'life cycle', one of the problems -----> we !!! 've encountered has been finding up to date replacement items for components which have become obsolete. Could you see the same situation arising in the case of the M8? I understand that Leica service have always said they are capable of repairing any of their products, no matter how old. I can see this being the case with mechanical components but wonder how they will go on replacing electronic components in 10 years time. This is in no way critical of Leica as it will apply equally to Nikon, Cannon and the rest; it's just something I'd never considered, in relation to a camera, until reading your excellent post. ________________ Thanks & regards, Tom Photography by Tom Lane",

Like anything internet use that information with caution. I always do my own measurement with a multi-meter.
