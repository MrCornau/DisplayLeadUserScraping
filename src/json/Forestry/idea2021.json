With blocks that heavy my first inclination would be a EastonMade style box wedge but I do like the simplicity of the vertical splitter and the blocks sitting on the flat . The large heavy blocks will still be a bit of a struggle on a vertical but a few rollers on the lift side would reduce the effort.\\nAnother helper idea I have thought of for a vertical would be to make turn table under the splitting wedge so you could turn the large block with little effort for initial break down. The turn table could be very simple with a heavy round piece of plate that insets in the table with a piece of rod in the centre that is sharpened to a point. It only has to lift up a little bit (\u00bc\" ?) to spin easy and could be lifted by a leaver that is hand or foot operated or lifted by the last little bit of the return stroke of the splitting cylinder. If using the splitting cylinder it would good to be able to engage and disengage it.\\nExpand Quote\\nI also like the simplicity of the vertical table splitter. I\\'m going to mull over the turn table idea for the big blocks. I\\'m still a bit worried about the weight since some of those have to be a solid 300lbs+.
