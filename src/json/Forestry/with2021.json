One suggestion, if you can fab a small arch with a horizontal roller on it, it will make things much better on the drag, as it will put more weight on the machine when you winch in, and go to drive out with a hitch on.\\nBeen thinking about it, however this thing has less than 5' wheelbase and flat land timber is almost non existent here. Tractor logging winches are pretty similar to this and I compare this machine to a compact tractor, so I figure someone else has already done the homework. That being said I'd like to come up with a small adjustable or removable arch to try and see how it does with it. Come to think of it, I could make one out of square tube that would slide into the receiver hitch and pin to those tabs on the sides of the winch frame. That would be simple and removable quick and easy if needed.\\nPicked up gliders and chokers yesterday. Mounted the saw scabbards and put the steps back on. Primered all my bare steel and notched the lower fairlead bracket so the gliders might have better clearance if pulling straight up. I'm wanting to add a log grapple to the blade so I can pickup more nose weight and move things easier. In the last pic, where the orange level is propped up, I think I'll put safety screen from there to just behind the saws, and will put screen on the sides from hood to top of cage. Still need to find a place to mount a tool box and pickup some sheet metal for the roof, it will slope up over top of the original ROP bar in back.\\nThoughts and input welcome as always.
