Today was one of those. I rented a plug core aerator to overseed my crabgrass (some folks call it a lawn - but mine is nothing but crabgrass at the moment.) First off, my 4-wheeler wouldn\\'t start. See \"Dang Chinese Carburetors\" in the General Board for that story. Well, I\\'ll pull it with my lawnmower. The Craftsman didn\\'t want much to do with it, but I drained some water out of the ballast tank and commenced to work. After about 20 minutes I came to a halt. Looked down......that high quality Chinese tube that I put in the rear tire last year had belched the valve stem. Went inside and called Dad. \"Is your 4 -wheeler running?\" \"Nope - got it back from the shop and it ran for about 2 weeks and it\\'s dead again.\" This is a Yamaha that has been a pain from the day he bought it. It has spent more time at the dealership than on the farm. Anyway......scratching my head......I\\'ll pull it with the Fordson Dexta......a little overkill for a 4 foot plug core but it got the job done. Now I need to put out seed and fertilizer. I\\'ll run to town and get a tube for the tire (while waiting on a new carb for my 4 wheeler). So I run to town. It\\'s a 30 minute trip for me. Drop in the local Tractor Supply and pick up a new tube for the lawnmower. Guess I should get a new tire, but it costs more than my lawnmower is worth. I come back out the door and the local Cub Scout pack hits me up for money. They are selling popcorn and peanuts. I didn\\'t have any cash. No problem.....he said we can take a credit card. Ok, \"How much is this bag of Caramel Popcorn?\" \"Twenty -five dollars comes the reply.\" DANG. It\\'s the Cub Scouts so I made a contribution. Came on home to put the tube in my tire. Opened the sealed box and pull out the tube. It is already cracked in the folds where it was in the box, so I\\'m back to square one. My sister told me the other day that she had a limb down in her yard that was blocking her circle drive. I asked her son if I could pull it out of the way with the tractor. He said yeah.....the tractor could pull it. I head up there with the tractor and chain. When I get there, the limb is about 12 inches in diameter and laid in the forks of a little maple tree in her yard. I didn\\'t want to destroy the maple so back to the house for the chainsaw. I cut the limb up and proceed to pull the brush out of the drive. I feel a burning sensation on my forearm. I thought it was a stinging caterpillar but I didn\\'t see him. Cleaned up the rest of the brush and went to stack the wood so Dad could come get it for firewood. I stepped in a yellow-jackets nest at the base of the maple and was promptly rewarded including one in the inside of my nose.......So, I\\'m quitting for the day.

Am a new member and just about ready to come full circle back into the world of sawmilling. Mid 1980's I was a pipe fitter for the gas utility and needed some logs milled. They were quite large and I didn't have the means to take them to the stationary mill. Saw an ad in the paper for a fellow that came on site with a portable mill. Had him come out to the house and got my logs cut into some lumber that I could use in woodworking.\\nLater that year I heard that he had quit custom sawing to work on his door making business. Talked with my wife and decided to buy a Woodmizer LT30 so I could cut our own lumber and do some custom work. It was only a 4 week wait (not like the 75 weeks I have to wait now) until the mill was ready. Thru word of mouth I was custom cutting every weekend and the mill was paid for in 9 months. Decided to upgrade to the LT40 with hydraulic log loader and rapidly paid for it. At this time I also bought a solar kiln to custom dry customer and my own lumber.\\nI was into year 6 working at the utility with no job upgrades for years as the company was struggling with poor upper management decisions and when people retired they did not replace them. Although I was making decent money and had the sawmill booked 4 months in advance I decided to pursue a life long dream, to become an airline pilot. The money I had made with the sawmill gave me the freedom to quit my job and financed my schooling.\\nI got all my ratings and flight time but never made it to the major airlines (I didn't have a college degree) so I found my way into corporate aviation. I've had a good run and been all over the world in my job, but the downside to corporate aviation is when money is tight at the corporation the first thing cut is the airplane and I've been thru 4 different operations since 1996. Although I've saved for retirement (401K) due to losing a year every time I have to start a new job and an expensive divorce where the ex received 50% of my 401K, my retirement plan is to keep working after I turn 65 and can no longer be pilot in command for International travel.\\nLuckily I'm in good health (so far) and enjoy being productive. During my corporate years I've been fortunate to have had plenty of time away from work and expanded my skillset. Up until the divorce I had several pieces of heavy equipment (Excavator, dozer, backhoe, lowboy) and would clear land, dig stock tanks, roads etc. but that had to be sold and I don't feel like taking on huge debt to buy more equipment. I took evening classes at the community college and learned HVAC work, eventually passing my master mechanical contractor license exams in 1996 and still hold my contractor license but getting up in hot attics in the Texas summers is less and less appealing to me as I get older.

The more complicated you make those systems, the more there is to break, and I just don't see any reasonable way to charge forestry equipment. Pulling out a 1,000 lb battery at the end of each shift so the employee can take it home and juice it up? Yea - that's not going to happen. What about guys who run double shifts? Need more energy partway through the day? Run a diesel generator to charge the battery? Guess there won't be any logging in California every time the wind blows and the grid shuts down. The grid in many places has a hard time staying up in the heat of the summer from folks running their A/C. How will the power be distributed for all of the transportation equipment? EV's have a limited place, and it sure isn't woods work.\\nWell, I'd agree on complicated. Electric vehicles are much much less complicated than ICE equivalents, in any product class. I had a JD 648 X stuck on a landing for 4 months because JD could not figure out what was wrong with it. I had to force logger to have it towed off. The faster I can get rid of the hydraulic and diesel powered equipment the more reliable, quieter, and more automated I can make a harvest.\\nThe worlds foremost lean design engineering firm in the automotive and aerospace sector is Sandy Munro's Munro and Associates. He's a car nut through and through, favorite hobby is off roading in his jeep. Old cuss. He's got a youtube channel and I suggest everyone that has question go and watch a few episodes where they break down a model Y or talk about the future of pickups, etc. They literally take out every single part, every part. from screws to washers to wires to chips to seat upholstery. Complete breakdown. Really really interesting to see him get into the details on cars, you get to see what is probably a $250,000 engineering report on youtube. So, don't take my word for it. Go hear what the world foremost outside consultant thinks.\\nWhich car is more complicated a tesla Y or a Civic? Then expand the nature of the beast to a skidder. Which do you think is more complicated. An electric skidder or a new skidder from JD. Charging a big battery will be a neat opportunity for someone but that's not much of a challenge. I can pretty much guarantee that big diesel engines are going to get much much more expensive as they become niche things for specialty applications. When trains and mining equipment guys have figured out that electric is better and they are getting ready to launch EV airplanes I don't see whats keeping someone from starting to build an EV skidder.\\nPluses:\\nMore efficient propulsion. Not converting fossilized sunlight into propulsion is over 2X as efficient.\\nCapital Expense- 4 electric motors are much less expensive than a giant diesel, hydraulic pumps, hoses, filters, radiators, coolants, more filters, oils, etc.\\nComplete computer control- Tesla sort of reimagined computer controls in a modern car; would benefit heavy equipment as well. It is as much software as hardware. Maybe in the future we could have a remote person running harvesters, get rid of cabs and ROP, CP etc. Reimagine the nature and layout by basically making it robotic. Visibility from cameras and drone. Get the person out of the machine - that's probably a 30 year thing but will likely happen.\\nCons: How to keep 500kwh battery charged.\\nOpportunities: Cut the cost of a current skidder. Create new process for charging a skidder overnight. Replace entire fleet of ICE forestry equipment.\\nExpand Quote\\nwyatt i don't disagree with what you are saying when looked at as individual line items. my stance is that you are looking at an individual machine vs an individual machine and not seeing how the entire support system for it plays out, how LONG it takes for the entire system to get there.\\nthe current system is established, is refined and will remain that way. it will not be one electric powered product that voids out an entire diesel powered world. it will require the entire EV system to be developed, refined and reliable.. at the same time as a failure in the diesel supporting world. it would take outrageous fuel prices, elimination of new parts, then a discontinuing of aftermarket parts by non oems and a whole generation of future mechanics to NOT take interest in diesel. look at all the smoke stacks and coal roller kids out there today.. you can't find an unmolested bro duty. the kids aren't quitting on diesel yet at all.\\nyou aren't a mechanic so you don't have a hard time letting go of a technology you never learned. there are many many people, myself included, who have spent their entire lives getting the education, tools and experience to work on the equipment we have. to just say its all gotta go.. it negates our investment against our will. it takes away the advantage i earned fair and square. of course there will be resistance to it. so you're new machine is trying to basically ruin some lives by making them start over like a kid again except one who probably doesn't know or want to learn how to insert a photo into an email or do a zoom meeting. at a certain point you just don't have the drive for new tricks anymore, so don't expect enthusiasm from them. people know that once they lose the drive, the new technology will make them obsolete in the industry they finally got settled into. I'm one of them.\\ni was an avionics tech in the marines, it was a very intensive schooling. sit in a chair but have a headache and exhaustion from trying to keep your brain awake and staying with it. in the field i worked on CH53D chopper electronic modules and they were obsolete by then so often could only be repaired by cannibalizing used units. the new stuff was retiring the old stuff so the support for it is abandoned. when you're electric skidder gets to that inevitable point, you won't be better off than the diesel. probably worse.\\nI'm telling you as someone with some experience that this new technology eventually becomes old technology that gets scrapped too. maybe sooner, maybe later. thats another gamble. it doesn't matter if shaft rotation comes from diesel combustion, stored solar, compressed air, air over hydraulic, steam, nuclear.. it doesn't matter. they all come and they all go.\\nsteam was simple and cheap, but dangerous. well i agree with you electric consolidates many systems (that to you are complex but to me are second nature) just like a few hundred volts DC is simple to some.. but dangerous to all. so give it enough tragic high voltage accidents by layman mechanics waiting 3 weeks for a service guy, and eventually the NHTSA or whoever seizes jurisdiction will decide that these things are too dangerous for the public to wrench and that licensing is required to service them. no? 3 phase is very simple but you need a license for that. plumbing is real simple, need a license for that. guess what. licensing reduces the number of technicians and raises their hourly rate.\\nso yes, you can bench race two machines and correctly say this one is x amount more efficient in the lab, on the dyno, even in our 2 year woods trials. but does that extrapolate into being X amount more money in your bank account over the ownership of the machine considering both uptime, downtime, purchase cost, maintenance and repairs? no one knows yet, its a gamble. deere 440As are still in service. nokia 5190s are not. but we can afford to toss a phone every 3 years, not a forwarder.\\nin 15, 20 years when the new technology is needing substantial repairs, has the market trained enough people to fill the need affordably? or have the manufacturers planned the machine for obsolescence with proprietary parts in order for their company to survive long term without regard for yours? cuz thats very common! it takes considerable business interruption to create the willingness for consumers to pay the aftermarket to dive in and solve hard problems.\\nif they don't.. then what? do you need to have a dead one out back to pop and swap control cards yourself just like i did in a avionics facility with rows of specialty test sets and top training? if the federal government can't buy a solution who can? the country has a STEM shortage. hydraulics is very old, and quite simple, but there is still a vast shortage in that branch of industry with respect to troubleshooters and mechanics. will electronics be any different? maybe, but the world at large still believes current flows from the red plus sign, when the electron flow that carries current is from negative to positive so I'm not optimistic there about people being able to maintain their EV.\\nthe diesel became reality around 1893. it was globally accepted and put into service worldwide, especially by WW2. but with all that demand, use and competition to improve.. truly they didn't even start to get really awesome until the 1980s with the cummins big cam, detroit 60 series and cat 3406B nearly 100 years after the first. the 3406E/C15 is probably the pinnacle of factory diesels and then emissions put them into decline. but see DEMAND AND ENTHUSIASM made them evolve to incredible levels of torque per cubic inch displacement. it has only been EMISSIONS that has limited them and forced them into decline. like girdling maples then saying maples just can't compete with oaks. it took 100 years for the support network around the diesel to mature. how many for the\\nEV?\\nthe brand new engines in the brand new aero trucks today are getting 8mpg in a field of old trucks getting 5mpg but the 5mpg operations aren't dying like the brand new truck guys all say they should have, because the reliability, parts support, and in house overhauling of the classic trucks is strong while it has never developed for the new. 2010 big rigs of all brands are pretty much universally hated for EGR problems and are dirt cheap because they wipe out everyone who tries to run one it seems. a 10yr old 700k mile plastic truck costs half of a 2 million mile 379 or w9, and thats just how it turned out. no one could know this in 1970. the guy i worked for will go out of business before he buys a volvo d12 much less some electric thing. the 5pmg truck does everything is supposed to with simplicity, including breaking down and getting put back together. so even the breakdowns are no problem. just pull it in the shop and wheel the tool cart over like always.\\nthe future of the EV thing is unknown. we are in the 1970s speculating about 2020. hell in 50 years will logging even be legal?
