It doesnt really matter what exactly, tgeyre all pretty similar. A commodity business is one with low margins and high volume. Due to low margin, it cannot pay on a small scale. Like making one bag a day of wood pellets or dog food for your living. Why bother? Either one is a huge business but only works on a huge scale.\\nThe problem is commodity producers have a lot of inertia and commodity markets are fickle. Think of semis driving too fast, too close on the interstate. Profit margin is the space between trucks. When the truck up front slams on the brakes all the following trucks have a big accordian wreck because lets face it.. You dont run a business too long without profit. In good markets demand is insatiable and wears your equipment and crew out. then in bad markets you may operate at a loss until you cant anymore. Feast or famine.\\nOpposite side of the story is high margin business. I was a micro-volume product manufacturer for 8 years of a product with no competition that i created. In the beginning i retailed by individual units on a custom order basis as i made them. then subbed most machining to a CNC and i wholesaled them exclusively to a single retailer when i couldnt keep up with the manufacturing. Today the product is distributed and wholesaled to multiple retailers. Profit margin was 700% when i started and 300ish % when i sold it to my partner. I never raised the price and made the same or a bit more money pretty much each year.\\nI never wore a machine out, had no employees after a 3 day trial run disaster, and never felt any sense of economic downturn ever (even 2008 ) because even as every single cost continually rose, my margin was so fat, it was always feast. i was able to absorb price rises to keep cost the same and try to discourage competitor entry. Order volume grew every consecutive year. It took 9 years for a competitor to arrive with a near clone but they didnt make a difference in new owners bottom line because his price was higher than ours. The niche was bigger than we all thought.\\nNot horn tooting here.. i made plenty of bad decisions and wasnt smart with the money, but its a real contrast. Consider a pallet sawyer verse a live edge conference table sawyer. What theyre physically doing is soooo close. But the business models are worlds apart.\\nI delivered logs to a pallet mill today that has millions in assets and a 45 man crew to produce a $15 widgit that i pickup by the truckload free all the time.\\nOne talented man can do top of the line tables in a 2 car garage with an alaskan, handheld powertools and sawhorses. But look at their margins. One has wiggle room to absorb slowdowns and the other will be run into the ground just by its payroll if global trade drops.\\nToday we call it value added but i think its really segregating yourself from the nearest competitor so his price is no longer weighing your price down.

"content": "('This January marks the 30th anniversary of Peterson Portable Sawmills!\\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the mill owners, agents, representatives, supporters and suppliers who have had our back over the past 30 years. Even our competitors, whose presence has driven us to create sawmills that produce above and beyond expectation.\\nThe first Peterson Portable Sawmill, a 6\" swing blade \\'LogDog\\' left the factory in January 1989 destined for Gisborne on the East Coast of New Zealand. The LogDog design was very basic: powered by a Stihl 084 chainsaw and utilising a frame which screwed to the log in order to set the mill\\'s vertical sizing. Our team have recently located this sawmill and are working on getting more information about the mill and the family it\\'s been part of for three decades - stay tuned!\\nThe Peterson Tube Frame, Production Frame and Standard Frame mills were launched shortly after, with improvements being made to each product the company released. In 1990, Peterson\\'s Production Frame was released as a hydraulic sawmill, utilizing a tractor\\'s PTO for power. Then in 1992, Briggs & Stratton motors were fit to the range.\\nAt this time, Carl Peterson, the mill\\'s inventor owned the company. Carl had conceived the first Peterson Portable Sawmill in 1977 while living deep in the jungle of the Fiji Islands.\\nIt wasn\\'t until 1988 that Carl took the first fully functioning prototype to the annual New Zealand National Fieldays and from then on Carl regularly attended the event, often entering (and winning) innovation competitions.\\nPeterson\\'s first international agent were the Lucas brothers in Australia in 1992. After a \\'gentleman\\'s handshake\\' they agreed to market Peterson Sawmills and helped Carl\\'s business grow in Australia for two years.\\nIt was in 1994 that the Lucas brothers began building their own sawmill in direct competition with the Peterson brand and thus ensued a 10 year court battle which cost Carl his home and business.\\nIn 2003, Kerris and Chris Browne, Carl\\'s daughter and son-in-law, purchased the Peterson trademark and intellectual property. Chris had worked with Carl from the start so he was able to use his engineering background in research and development to refine existing models and bring new models on board.\\nToday, the Brownes continue to innovate, manufacture and export a refined range of Peterson Portable Sawmills for the international market. Carl is now retired and living in New Zealand\\'s Central Plateau.\\nNow, 30 years after the first Peterson Portable Sawmill was sold, we manufacture four swingblade sawmill models and one dedicated slabbing unit. We also sell a range of accessories to compliment our products and help our operators work smarter, not harder!\\nPeterson remains a family business with some of our staff having worked with the company for over 25 years. 2019 Marks the thirteenth year I\\'ve been part of the Peterson team and I\\'m still as passionate about our products as when I first started.\\nIf you have any stories to share about your experience with Peterson Sawmills, we\\'d love to hear from you!
