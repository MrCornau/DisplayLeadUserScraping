I had a friend in college that happened to have a red Nikon D3300 available, and that she offered to sell at a relatively cheap price. I had zero knowledge about cameras, lenses, brands, etc. So I agreed at the time because a friend of mine suggested that it wasn't that bad of a camera for beginner photograpers - now I know he had a Canon with even lower specs than the camera I bought - so he convinced me to go for it since it would perform just fine for the work I was doing and because of the quality/price balance I was being offered. \n\nSo now 2 years after, I've gotten to know my camera a whole lot better, the camera's sensor really kicks butt when used properly, those 24mpx can give me some crispy clear shots. So I've gotta say that my friend was right, the D3300 is way more than what meets the eye. I still have the kit lens and about a year ago I bought the 85mm f1.8 lens. My photography has improved a whole lot since (I do a bit of everything: street, architecture and portrait photography).\n\nSo now that I'm a bit more experienced, I've also gotten to notice the faults the camera also possesses, for example:\n\u2022 While recording (or movie mode), the camera really struggles dealing with blacks and shadows, limiting my possibilities of recording in low light situations.\n\u2022 Autofocus is laughable, constantly popping in and out and forcing me to simpler shots that can only be handled with manual focus.\n\u2022 LCD screen is fixed, also limiting the flexibility that some of the shots should have.\n\nSo now that I'm not necessarily an amateur, I've really started to think about upgrading. I don't know if I should sell all my gear to switch brands, or if I should stick with Nikon to keep the 85mm lens. The Nikon z50 has been the apple of my eye as of recently, but it bothers me that the mount is different to the one I currently have for the 85. I've checked Canon and Fujifilm cameras but I've really grown a soft spot for Nikon because of my buddy, the D3300.\n\nBottom line: I don't know what I should do next. The amount of cameras and specs still overwhelms me, so I need guidance, also, I live in a third world country (Mexico), so saving money to buy/switch gear can be a bit of a challenge. So I need something that is budget friendly.\n\nAnyway, that's about it.

I\u2019m a semi-professional photographer (read: not my day job) who specializes in live events, architectural, and specialty photography. Most of my work is within my local city for private businesses and the city government itself. The use of my images is primarily for marketing purposes and centers around social media use and promotion of the businesses and events for those who hire me.\n\nRecently a \u201clarge corporate entity\u201d (not to be named) has begun a campaign to advertise their presence in the city and is showcasing a lot of the businesses and events found here using some familiar images. I am fairly certain they obtained those images from the city, who originally hired me to to photograph them, even though I have a clause in my contract that limits use beyond the original licensee (no sub-licensing). The good news is that I\u2019ve been put in touch with this larger entity and they are asking to directly license several images for use, and these include the photos that have already been shared on social media. (Yeah, I\u2019m a little concerned that this happened in reverse though I\u2019m not going to ruin a good relationship and I\u2019m glad to have a proper path forward.)\n\nThat said, I am no stranger to licensing my images for various purposes though that is usually to a distinct person or entity for a very specific use. Also, I\u2019ve provided images for exclusive use before, but not for the broad description that has been provided in the corporate contract I\u2019m now reviewing. Here are the primary concerns I have over the terms and there are questions that I feel need to be brought up with this corporate entity before I can fulfill their request:\n\n1. I am the copyright holder of the images and owner of the images, though I still need to ensure the images will not violate the rights of any third party. Since all of the images to be licensed were created at public events I do not have model releases, even for stage performers. The chosen images do (or will) have crowd faces blurred as the people are not the sole subject, the ambiance of the event is what\u2019s being used. I feel I may have to decline the performer images unless I can get a release from them if I can track down a contact. Is there anything I\u2019m missing in this scenario that would pose a problem? I feel there is enough precedence regarding \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d and the voluntary presence at a public event that puts participants in a position of implicitly giving consent by their attendance.\n2. The requesting entity is asking for an \u201cunlimited, perpetual, exclusive, irrevocable worldwide license to distribute, publicly display, alter, edit, retouch and create derivative works\u201d. For the most part I don\u2019t have an issue with this\u2014the images are not on their own of any monetary value beyond what was already paid to capture them. Aside from my own portfolio, the contract does state that I cannot license the works to any other parties. However, there are a few which have already been licensed by other (or original) entities or I consider released as public domain (meaning enough people have stolen one image that I don\u2019t have the time or energy to go after compensation). Does prior licensing exclude me from granting an exclusive license going forward\u2014or should I simply inform the requesting entity and have them make the determination of whether they wish to proceed with certain images?\n3. The requesting entity intends to use the images for marketing and advertising purposes in digital and print media, and/or prints for framed photographs. There used to be a pricing calculator on Getty\u2019s website, but they seem to have caught on to folks using it for free and now it just prompts you to call them for more info. How does one determine a fair and reasonable licensing price for mixed distribution when the usage seems open-ended? Should I just invest in some more trustworthy software to help get me in a ballpark range?\n\nSo my main concerns are fair pricing and obtaining releases.

And I would go one step beyond and even claim that it is soon going to die.\n\nLet me explain my point of view and why I believe so. I will start with some trivial reasons and then move on the main reason in the latter half of this discussion post. \n\nFirst of all I am really worried with the advancement in camera technology happening these days and it getting cheaper and more accessible every day. There are so many hobbyist (like me) that are coming up due to this and they like to take their pictures themselves. They don't need a lot of fancy gear and can get what they want even from their smartphones and software techniques without much pain. There are already cameras in smartphones that can open up to f/1.4 (Vivo X60 pro) giving tremendous low light performance for example. So be it, but the most worrisome part is that they are ready to sell their pictures (again like me) for peanuts. I for example sell my photos for less than a dollar per picture. May be this doesn't pose a lot of threat to professionals but keep up with me.\n\nNext issue that I would like to point out is that of websites like unsplash and pexels. People including some top notch photographers post their pictures here for free. Individuals and more importantly major companies/industries now have an access to large amount of stock photos for free! I myself was shocked to see my photos reaching far and wide to websites like Buzzfeed, WordPress, Flickr etc and I gained nothing in return apart from come graphs and stats showing my reach, views and downloads.\n\nAll these things are eating up the photography market from inside out like a parasite I believe. But as if this was not enough, let me introduce you to GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). So far you might be wondering that there is still scope for specialization in fields like weddings, fashion, product, food, landscape, wildlife, portraits etc. If so, then I request you to kindly read further into this discussion.\n\nGANs are a deep learning based set of algorithm that can literally do magic. They will change the dynamics completely. **Photos will soon be created** (not taken). Once trained against a large set of database (which is available for free as mentioned before), they can make new photos. restore old photos, include what you want in a scene (like yourself), replace something that you want in a scene and what not!\n\nSome applications already available are:\n\n* Generation of random realistic portraits/models completely wiping out fashion photography.\n* Generation of cartoon characters, wiping out graphics/vector designers.\n* Image to image translation. (restoring old photos as high definition new photos, black and white to color images, sketches to realistic images)\n* Text to image translation. wiping out landscape/wildlife photography. (literally converting text like, \"A small Indian ringneck sitting on a branch\" into multiple image choices.)\n* Face repositioning and regeneration. (generate/reorient a face into required position)\n\nGANs are no joke. The results are already staggering. You must have seen deepfake challenges inviting you to find the difference between fake and original images.\n\n I would like to know your thoughts on it.

And want to go lighter for my travels sometime soon. I own 2 canon lenses, 24 to 105L f4 and a 50 f1.4. The image quality is splendid to my liking. I do however want to go smaller because frankly I don't have enough space. I want to upgrade! (I do semi professional quality stuff) So I initially was gonna go all in when I saw the Canon M50, it was amazing how small it was, but I got the gut feeling that it wasn't the right one for me. 1. It's APSC which tbh, isn't a deal breaker, I can sacrifice that. But! I can't use my lenses, it's some weird mount. 2. It feels so cheap, that's not why you want a camera, I keep reminding myself you buy it for you to use, and it's how you use it. But at the same time, if I feel unhappy with the quality of the product I'll get so annoyed. \n\nSo I held back. So then I was like, fk it, let's check out Sony and other brands, I went to the store, tried out the M50 on my hand. Nope, it's an instant no. Too uncomfortable. I then proceeded to try the Sony A6500, dam it felt much better in the hand. Just ergonomically. And the 4k recording is just so tempting, I've watched YouTube clips and the 4k quality is just day and night with M50 VS A6500. Then I got introduced to the flippy screens, oh my God those are a deal breaker for me. It's almost like a must have. And the M50 has that! \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29. Then I was like the A6500 came out like 2 ish years ago, surely a new one will come out soon (guessing A6700) and I'll just get that. But the sales person proceeded to show me the A7iii \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0ammmm that thing truly goes back to what I said before. \"I want to upgrade\". So now I'm like, the A6500 and the M50 is kinda like buying the same thing as my 6d, but just smaller. The A7iii isn't much lighter than the 6d, but it is much less conspicuous, and I have to go E mount. So I'm like maybe just wait til A6700, but again I need to go away soon so Sony please announce the A6700 Soon! Then the Canon Eos R came out, ohhh loooorrrddd. So many options. The budget is $3000AUD. Probably won't be able to get the Eos R, it does have the flip screen \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11 this is killing me. \n\nSo should I go Sony A7iii, or wait for A6700 or go Canon R? \ud83e\udd14 It's so hard to decide.

I had a friend in college that happened to have a red Nikon D3300 available, and that she offered to sell at a relatively cheap price. I had zero knowledge about cameras, lenses, brands, etc. So I agreed at the time because a friend of mine suggested that it wasn't that bad of a camera for beginner photograpers - now I know he had a Canon with even lower specs than the camera I bought - so he convinced me to go for it since it would perform just fine for the work I was doing and because of the quality/price balance I was being offered. \n\nSo now 2 years after, I've gotten to know my camera a whole lot better, the camera's sensor really kicks butt when used properly, those 24mpx can give me some crispy clear shots. So I've gotta say that my friend was right, the D3300 is way more than what meets the eye. I still have the kit lens and about a year ago I bought the 85mm f1.8 lens. My photography has improved a whole lot since (I do a bit of everything: street, architecture and portrait photography).\n\nSo now that I'm a bit more experienced, I've also gotten to notice the faults the camera also possesses, for example:\n\u2022 While recording (or movie mode), the camera really struggles dealing with blacks and shadows, limiting my possibilities of recording in low light situations.\n\u2022 Autofocus is laughable, constantly popping in and out and forcing me to simpler shots that can only be handled with manual focus.\n\u2022 LCD screen is fixed, also limiting the flexibility that some of the shots should have.\n\nSo now that I'm not necessarily an amateur, I've really started to think about upgrading. I don't know if I should sell all my gear to switch brands, or if I should stick with Nikon to keep the 85mm lens. The Nikon z50 has been the apple of my eye as of recently, but it bothers me that the mount is different to the one I currently have for the 85. I've checked Canon and Fujifilm cameras but I've really grown a soft spot for Nikon because of my buddy, the D3300.\n\nBottom line: I don't know what I should do next. The amount of cameras and specs still overwhelms me, so I need guidance, also, I live in a third world country (Mexico), so saving money to buy/switch gear can be a bit of a challenge.
