I really need some help, or at least an advice.\n\nLONG STORY SHORT, the power source (battery) detached from the camera while it just started buffering. And now does not even turn on.\n\nA couple of months ago I got myself an extremely rare panasonic vhs camcorder from 1985. It was in a perfect working condition, included stuff like battery pack charger, socket plug, and 2 12V battery packs (that of course do not hold any charge as they are 30+ years old).\n\nI found a way to \u201cfix\u201d the battery packs (i needed battery packs so i could film outside etc). So, I ordered a new 12V drill battery for \u00a330 off ebay. Disassembled one of battery packs, detached old insides and rewired a new drill battery to it.\n\nI rewired it properly (positive to positive contact, and vice versa). HOWEVER i havent fixed the new battery on the old case before testing it out. This is where i cocked up.\n\nSo i attached a DIY battery pack onto the camera back and turned it on. JUST AS it started working (i heard sounds, it was actually buffering), the battery pack literally fell off. And detached from contacts. Meaning, while the camera was operating and setting up to turn on, the source of electricity suddenly detached.\n\nMy issue is: the camera does not turn on anymore. Not even if i plug it in the socket directly, not even if i use both DIY battery pack and the plug.\n\nWhat do i do now? I really, really love this camcorder and i cant accept such a loss tbh. There was no power overload, so how do i fix this?\n\nAsk for any details and please help me &lt;3", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/b0r3vn/panasonic_nvm1_rare_camcorder/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "panasonic nv-m1 rare camcorder /!/  hey vhsheads and camera enthusiasts! i really need some help, or at least an advice.\n\nlong story short, the power source (battery) detached from the camera while it just started buffering. and now does not even turn on.\n\na couple of months ago i got myself an extremely rare panasonic vhs camcorder from 1985. it was in a perfect working condition, included stuff like battery pack charger, socket plug, and 2 12v battery packs (that of course do not hold any charge as they are 30+ years old).\n\ni found a way to \u201cfix\u201d the battery packs (i needed battery packs so i could film outside etc). so, i ordered a new 12v drill battery for \u00a330 off ebay. disassembled one of battery packs, detached old insides and rewired a new drill battery to it.\n\ni rewired it properly (positive to positive contact, and vice versa). however i havent fixed the new battery on the old case before testing it out. this is where i cocked up.\n\nso i attached a -----> diy !!!  battery pack onto the camera back and turned it on. just as it started working (i heard sounds, it was actually buffering), the battery pack literally fell off. and detached from contacts. meaning, while the camera was operating and setting up to turn on, the source of electricity suddenly detached.\n\nmy issue is: the camera does not turn on anymore. not even if i plug it in the socket directly, not even if i use both diy battery pack and the plug.\n\nwhat do i do now? i really, really love this camcorder and i cant accept such a loss tbh. there was no power overload, so how do i fix this?\n\nask for any details and please help me &lt;3", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 76742, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "fisheveadventures", "date": "2019-03-10 23:28:03", "content": "DIY - Create Awesome Flash Diffuser for Macro Photography", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/azlzlw/diy_create_awesome_flash_diffuser_for_macro/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "-----> diy !!!  - create awesome flash diffuser for macro photography", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 76785, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "KD637orJoe", "date": "2019-04-30 14:06:58", "content": "Best camera lens bag/pouch/case for a videographer that runs? /!/ On days when I\u2019m filming, I can clock up to 15 miles walking and running.
