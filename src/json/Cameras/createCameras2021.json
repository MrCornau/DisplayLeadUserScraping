It's important that our battalion takes photographs of what we do to create a public image. Unfortunately, since many of us are busy engineering students, it is rare that we come across someone that is a good photographer, or someone who has even taken basic classes. Every semester our photographer position changes meaning that oftentimes, it's difficult to even prepare for the role.\n\nWe are currently searching for a new camera as our old one is starting to get outdated. The camera is an older Nikon D3100 and the age is starting to show.  My supervisor didn't give me an exact budget range, but told me \"I would suggest avoiding the cheapest option but also don\u2019t think we need top-of-the-line either\". So the budget is a little flexible here.\n\nI'm asking for your help in suggestions of cameras that would fit our needs. What we're looking for is a camera with some of the following traits, listed in order of priority:\n\n1. **Ease of use**. We're looking for something that's easier to \"just pick up and shoot\" with. We realize that no camera makes you a perfect photographer, but whatever you guys think is on the more user-friendly side!\n\n2. **Still photography**. Many of the pictures we take are at events where the subjects can hold a pose, so high quality photos of non-moving subjects would be great.\n\n3. **Low light**. Oftentimes I've found myself in a situation where I struggle to get enough exposure without getting super blurry shots. I'm not quite sure if this is a trait that differs between cameras, but this would be a nice quality to have in our camera.\n\n4. **Moving photography**. I know this one contradicts #2 a little bit but I thought I'd throw it out there. We also like to take pictures of our midshipmen in action, such as PT, close order drill, field exercises, etc. Again, not a must-have but a nice addition.\n\n* We're also looking for some **lenses**! One or two is really all we can afford.\n\nI totally understand that good photography is the product of a *good photographer, not a good camera*. Unfortunately, we rarely have the time to give our midshipmen classes on photography, so we're kind of forced to rely on a good camera. \n\nAny suggestion helps my search! Ironically as the photographer I don't know too much about photography, especially since I'm trying to learn Illustrator and Photoshop at the same time, all on top of my regular workload.

I'd like to hold on to the G7x for out and about or situations where convenience of its size might outweigh the need for quality. The issue is, I could knock a few hundy off the SL2 if i sold my G7x and I'm thinking that if i'll be upgrading my Smartphone at some point in the near future, is there really any advantage to keeping the G7x II? I don't really even vlog personally anymore but the camera has a little bit of a nostalgia for me so I'm having a pretty hard time deciding what to do, i just can't stand to keep putting out this low quality content. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/n4pcy7/g7x_ii_vs_smartphone_vs_sl2200d/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "im creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "g7x ii vs. smartphone vs. sl2/200d ?? /!/ hey all, i've happened into the business of social media this year which means i'm expected to produce high quality photo and video on a regular basis. \n\ni already had on hand the g7x mark ii and i'm currently running a galaxy note 8 (but will likely be upgrading the phone within the next year or so). \n\ni'm somewhere between novice and intermediate when it comes to camera work so i'm not sure how much of it is user error but -----> i !!!  just find that most of the footage -----> i !!!  take for work these days with the g7x ii is total ass unless -----> i !!! -----> m !!!  doing macro-ish stuff (and its not even a good macro camera) or casual vlogging (which doesnt serve any purpose in the content -----> i !!! -----> m !!!  -----> creating !!!  as -----> i !!!  run pages for brands). \n\nsome of my content is street photography and i can manage some really nice still shots with the g7x despite the limitations of the point and shoot, the issue is mostly video which is what the camera is supposed to be for?\n\ni find that the focus is unreliable as well as the quality though ive gone through my settings many times searching for the best options.\n\ni'll insert two links to posts ive created with footage from the g7x that i feel are simply horrendous but i had no choice.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/cotqjythhna/?igshid=3eu966jf06wh\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/cjbrfszfvqq/?igshid=qv4bz6us4vnm\n\nthe first one has no correction as i didnt have the time but it wouldnt have helped anyway. as you can see, the second video likely would have been better just left raw. \n\nthe audio alone is enough to make me want to upgrade, though, i do have access to a zoom mic, id much rather spend 30 bucks on a nice little camera mic that i dont have to rig seperately. \n\nheres my dillemma:\n\ni'm interested in the canon sl2/200d but the pricetag is steep for me in my current situation... i'd like to hold on to the g7x for out and about or situations where convenience of its size might outweigh the need for quality. the issue is, i could knock a few hundy off the sl2 if i sold my g7x and i'm thinking that if i'll be upgrading my smartphone at some point in the near future, is there really any advantage to keeping the g7x ii? i don't really even vlog personally anymore but the camera has a little bit of a nostalgia for me so i'm having a pretty hard time deciding what to do, i just can't stand to keep putting out this low quality content. \n\nany thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 22381, "year": "2021"}], "name": "createCameras2021"}
