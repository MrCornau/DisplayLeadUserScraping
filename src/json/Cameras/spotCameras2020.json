I had a friend in college that happened to have a red Nikon D3300 available, and that she offered to sell at a relatively cheap price. I had zero knowledge about cameras, lenses, brands, etc. So I agreed at the time because a friend of mine suggested that it wasn't that bad of a camera for beginner photograpers - now I know he had a Canon with even lower specs than the camera I bought - so he convinced me to go for it since it would perform just fine for the work I was doing and because of the quality/price balance I was being offered. \n\nSo now 2 years after, I've gotten to know my camera a whole lot better, the camera's sensor really kicks butt when used properly, those 24mpx can give me some crispy clear shots. So I've gotta say that my friend was right, the D3300 is way more than what meets the eye. I still have the kit lens and about a year ago I bought the 85mm f1.8 lens. My photography has improved a whole lot since (I do a bit of everything: street, architecture and portrait photography).\n\nSo now that I'm a bit more experienced, I've also gotten to notice the faults the camera also possesses, for example:\n\u2022 While recording (or movie mode), the camera really struggles dealing with blacks and shadows, limiting my possibilities of recording in low light situations.\n\u2022 Autofocus is laughable, constantly popping in and out and forcing me to simpler shots that can only be handled with manual focus.\n\u2022 LCD screen is fixed, also limiting the flexibility that some of the shots should have.\n\nSo now that I'm not necessarily an amateur, I've really started to think about upgrading. I don't know if I should sell all my gear to switch brands, or if I should stick with Nikon to keep the 85mm lens. The Nikon z50 has been the apple of my eye as of recently, but it bothers me that the mount is different to the one I currently have for the 85. I've checked Canon and Fujifilm cameras but I've really grown a soft spot for Nikon because of my buddy, the D3300.\n\nBottom line: I don't know what I should do next. The amount of cameras and specs still overwhelms me, so I need guidance, also, I live in a third world country (Mexico), so saving money to buy/switch gear can be a bit of a challenge.

Carl Zeiss Apo Sonnar T* 135mm f/2... the king of sharpness, contrast, bokeh, 3D pop... /!/ I have owned some amazing gear in my 10+ years of shooting. Some pieces that immediately spring to mind: Nikon 105mm f/1.4E ED, Nikon 135mm f/2DC, Nikon 58mm f/1.4G, and not least, the APO-Summicron 50mm (for M-mount) among my favourite 35mm lenses, and then some legendary medium format glass that was mounted on the Pentax 67II, Mamiya RZ67 Pro II, Hasselblad 503cw... \n\nZeiss glass had always been on my radar if for no reason other than their optics coming standard with many legendary kits (Hasselblad, Contax, Sony, etc.), but I never gave much thought to owning their Nikon-mount stuff. I wasn't really stoked about the idea of owning a big and heavy manual focus lens for my digital rig. But the guy I purchased my Nikon 105 1.4 from tipped me off, suggesting that the older Classic ZF2 line 135 2 Apo Sonnar by Zeiss was easily the best lens he'd ever used (and that's including the much more expensive Zeiss Otus 85 he owned)- of course such high praise lit a fire under my arse to go and find one. This actually proved to be a deceptively easy task... you can find much of the ZF2 line for sale at any time, but the 135 specifically proved to be quite difficult to track down- especially in good condition. Well, as luck would have it, not a week into my search, one popped up a few hours away from me. I negotiated the price down a bit and organized an exchange with the (now former) owner at a spot between our two cities- a couple hours out for me. Deal done, I was now the owner of this lens which was so highly regarded by the random Craigslist bloke I mentioned earlier. \n\nWhat immediately struck me on handling the lens was how incredibly solid it felt. This very well could be the best feeling product I have ever purchased- and the includes even the much, much more expensive Leica APO-Summicron 50... I saved firing off any shots with it until the next day when I had a shoot scheduled, but even just testing it out in the parking lot I was amazed at how much easier it was to focus with this thing than I had anticipated. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to the very next day, and I'm at my portrait shoot. I was eager to see how the image looked right after the first shot, and remember letting out a \"Holy shit!\" even after just reviewing it on the tiny screen. The model came over to see what I was fussing about, and even she remarked how incredibly detailed everything was, and how there seemed to be a \"3D pop\". I admittedly only used it for a few minutes at a time, because on my D850 with grip attached, it is an extremely heavy package, and arm fatigue is a very real thing while wielding this beast. Upon arriving back home and viewing the files on my 27\" monitor, I was surprised to see that I achieved perfect focus on about 90% of the images- pretty good for an mf lens, I thought. But what really blew my mind away in a way no other piece of gear has ever blown my mind away previously or since, was the unprecedented sharpness, the incredibly lush bokeh, the contrast/microcontrast, colour rendition, and the amazing 3D pop. I had been used to some pretty nice glass by this point, but this really blew everything else out of the water- I was genuinely not expecting to be *this* wowed by this lens. \n\nEach and every time I use this lens, I count my blessings... I am so lucky to be able to use such a superlative piece of equipment to help execute my visions. I'm also very fortunate to have gotten such a clean one at a very fair price (around $900 USD, maybe slightly less). All that said, I simply don't use it near enough, because A) despite doing lots of portrait stuff, 135mm is simply too tight for most stuff I shoot, and B) it's just too heavy a lens. That doesn't take away from the fact that I absolutely adore every frame I've ever shot on it, and see it as a special treat anytime I use it. \n\nAnyways, I apologize for the long-winding post, but I just wanted to share my enthusiasm for this truly incredible piece of equipment, which I cannot recommend highly enough. I'd love to someday own their Otus 100 1.4, but that is a tough one to justify.
