The most important think I'm looking for is comfortability, and ease of use and access to features.\n\n-------------------\n\nNikon Z5:\nThe good:\nSince I've been using a Nikon for about 4 years now, playing around with the Z5 was super easy and intuitive.\nI've heard it's one of the best cameras for low light photography, which is nice for portrait photos and astrophotography.\n\nThe bad:\nI hate the fact that the rear screen is a tilt rather than a flip screen, especially for portrait photos, I love to take photos in a vertical position, so the tilt screen is useless here. Another somewhat big issue is the lens prices. I really like using prime lenses, but any lens I was looking at was about 2-3x the cost of the competitor brands.\n\nOverall: my number 1 pick, if it wasn't for the lens prices.\n\n-------------------\n\nCanon EOS R:\nThe good:\nGreat lens prices.\nI loved the fact that I can assign anything I want to any of the buttons.\n\nThe bad:\nSo many options within the camera menu, I kept getting lost in the menus.\nThe price of this camera is almost double the price of the other two.\nThe \"custom buttons\" we're more finicky than useful.\n\nOverall: I like the customizability, the prices of the lenses, and the rear screen, but the actual controls were not as impressive and the camera body is way more expensive than other picks.\n\n-------------------\n\nSony a7III:\nThe good:\nVery large lens selection at great prices.\n\nThe bad:\nThe controls of the camera were very confusing to me, took way longer to figure out how to change specific settings.\nThe only way to change ISO was through the digital screen, I was not able to change ISO using the dials on the camera body.\nIt is a somewhat old camera compared to the other two.\n\nOverall: The sony feels like it lands in between the Nikon and the Canon in comfortability, usability, and lens selection/pricing. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any experience with those cameras, please let me know what you think, and please let me know if I'm wrong about any of my findings.\n\n\nEdit: (adding the main reasons I want to ditch the D3400)\nThe D3400 doesn't allow me to do time lapse and is pretty bad at long exposure photos. This camera does not support any external remotes so I cannot even shoot remotely with it.\nThe auto focus is the worst auto focus I've ever seen so I have to rely on my manual focus, which is fine for steady shots of stationary objects, but as soon as the object starts moving, I have very bad time focusing on the subject. Another issue with focusing is that I do not see it through the view finder so I have to use the rear screen to adjust my focus, and change the camera to view finder and hope the focus is still on the subject, since the dslr takes soooo much longer to snap a photo while using the rear screen.\n\nEdit 2: I'm trying to upgrade the camera so I can keep it for a few years, and not feel guilty spending more money on the gear for it.\nEvery time I've purchased anything for the D3400, I've felt like I was throwing away money, because I knew I will need to upgrade the camera at some point.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/juspny/which_mirrorless_for_an_enthusiast/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "which mirrorless for an enthusiast? /!/ i have started with a nikon d3400 about 4 years ago, and i'm ready to upgrade my camera because of the limitations of the d3400.\n\ni'm not a pro nor do i share my photos anywhere, i'm just doing it for my own pleasure/hobby. \n\ni like to take photos of nature(animals, plants, trees), astrophotography (moon, stars, time lapse, long exposure photos), cars(when i go on car rides to coastal roads), and portrait (i'm not great at it, but this is something i'm currently working on getting better at)\n\nafter a very long and dreadful research, i have narrowed it down to 3 cameras:\n-canon eos r (or rp)\n-nikon z5\n-sony a7iii\n\ni'm looking for suggestions on which of those cameras should i go for. the most important think i'm looking for is comfortability, and ease of use and access to features.\n\n-------------------\n\nnikon z5:\nthe good:\nsince i've been using a nikon for about 4 years now, playing around with the z5 was super easy and intuitive.\ni've heard it's one of the best cameras for low light photography, which is nice for portrait photos and astrophotography.\n\nthe bad:\ni hate the fact that the rear screen is a tilt rather than a flip screen, especially for portrait photos, i love to take photos in a vertical -----> position !!! , so the tilt screen is useless here. another somewhat big issue is the lens prices. i really like using prime lenses, but any lens i was looking at was about 2-3x the cost of the competitor brands.\n\noverall: my number 1 pick, if it wasn't for the lens prices.\n\n-------------------\n\ncanon eos r:\nthe good:\ngreat lens prices.\ni loved the fact that i can assign anything i want to any of the buttons.\n\nthe bad:\nso many options within the camera menu, i kept getting lost in the menus.\nthe price of this camera is almost double the price of the other two.\nthe \"custom buttons\" we're more finicky than useful.\n\noverall: i like the customizability, the prices of the lenses, and the rear screen, but the actual controls were not as impressive and the camera body is way more expensive than other picks.\n\n-------------------\n\nsony a7iii:\nthe good:\nvery large lens selection at great prices.\n\nthe bad:\nthe controls of the camera were very confusing to me, took way longer to figure out how to change specific settings.\nthe only way to change iso was through the digital screen, i was not able to change iso using the dials on the camera body.\nit is a somewhat old camera compared to the other two.\n\noverall: the sony feels like it lands in between the nikon and the canon in comfortability, usability, and lens selection/pricing. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nif you have any experience with those cameras, please let me know what you think, and please let me know if i'm wrong about any of my findings.\n\n\nedit: (adding the main reasons i want to ditch the d3400)\nthe d3400 doesn't allow me to do time lapse and is pretty bad at long exposure photos. this camera does not support any external remotes so i cannot even shoot remotely with it.\nthe auto focus is the worst auto focus i've ever seen so i have to rely on my manual focus, which is fine for steady shots of stationary objects, but as soon as the object starts moving, i have very bad time focusing on the subject. another issue with focusing is that i do not see it through the view finder so i have to use the rear screen to adjust my focus, and change the camera to view finder and hope the focus is still on the subject, since the dslr takes soooo much longer to snap a photo while using the rear screen.\n\nedit 2: i'm trying to upgrade the camera so i can keep it for a few years, and not feel guilty spending more money on the gear for it.\nevery time i've purchased anything for the d3400, i've felt like i was throwing away money, because i knew i will need to upgrade the camera at some point.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 7145, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 213641, "autor": "dearpisa", "date": 1594360846000, "content": "Is there any L-bracket that works with a fully articulating screen? /!/ As title says.
