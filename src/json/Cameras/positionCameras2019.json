I know that these cameras are all vastly different, and that the camera I currently have is an absolutely amazing piece of technology, however I really want to buy a camera that allows me to delve deeper into the actual art of photography but at the same time can be used as a professional tool for the work that I\u2019ve been thrust into. This camera should be used as a hobby/tool camera, rather than my A7iii which I use solely as a tool. \n\nI know there are a million videos on YouTube describing the pros and cons of each camera, but I want some real life user feedback, and if possible some factors that have made you guys choose one or the other, and any small little details that you love or hate about any of the cameras mentioned. Also, if anyone else has any other cameras that they absolutely love, please drop a reply so I can consider those.\n\np.s. I\u2019ve thought about renting each for a week and comparing in real life, but I can\u2019t seem to find any good rental sites (UK), if anyone could point me in the right direction that would be very appreciated. Also, I have considered the possibility that this entire dilemma might just be me wanting what I don\u2019t have or just having a new expensive \u201ctoy\u201d, however I\u2019ve been wanting a dslr for months now and I really like the idea of changing up my workflow and whole image-capturing process.\n\nTLDR:\nCan\u2019t decide on a new camera, current favs are 1DX-II, 5D-IV, D850, GFX-50S.

Comparing to the other competling 3-axis gimbal, Zhiyun, you may be wondering which is the better one to choose? I will proceed to compare these two products, listing their pros and cons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n First, product specs. \n\n **Ronin-SC vs Zhiyun Weebill Lab** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6gspqufri0c31.png\n\n**1.Camera Compability**\n\nAlthough these two gimbals are quite similar, it\u2019s worth mentioning that DJI\u2019s Ronin-SC is compatible with a wider range of mirrorless cameras as you can see in above comparison form.\n\n**2. Payload**\n\nThere is also a slight difference in the payload of these 2 gimbals. The maximum payload of DJI Ronin-SC is up to 2kg. It is less than the 3kg payload as claimed by Zhiyun Weebill Lab, but as some of Zhiyun's users said only under the most ideal conditions can 3kg be achieved, and you'llhave to balance the gimabl perfectly to get the best performance out of it. And in this case, DJI is understating its payload a bit, it can actually go a little higher.\n\n**3. Object Tracking System**\n\nDJI Ronin-SC has revolutionized its tracking system in its latest **ActiveTrack 3.0**. Advanced algorithms is used to lock and track subjects. You can just mount your phone to your gimbal-mounted camera using the included phone holder, or you can use the Ronin App and your smartphone\u2019s camera to select and track any object in your frame.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhiyun has actually launched their Object Tracking function in gimbals since its early products, but it's quite awkward that no visible development had been made to their Object Tracking function since launch. It's definitly not a selling point for Zhiyun.\n\n**4. Stability**\n\nI'll say if it's a DJI product, the last thing you need to worry about is their stabilization algorithm. DJI Ronin-SC's new **Sport Mode** has faster tracking speed and more advanced algotithm than Zhiyun's Phonego Mode. But actually these two products are both doing great job on stability, and they are almost equally matched in this industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Underslung mode**\n\nBoth of Ronin-SC and Weebill Lab have underslung mode, but there's still some difference how these two machine work in underslung modes. With DJI Ronin-SC, you can just flip gimbal handle upside down, and then it's above your camera in vertical position. You can get ground-level low-angle with this. But with Weebill lab, when it's working in underslung mode, it won't turn left and right when flipped over. It's actually more comfortable to carry with a Weebill, but it's rather a knee- level shot rather than low angle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp to this point, I say it\u2019s obvious that Ronin-SC is the superior product. And you can check out more detailed comparison video between these two products on Youtube. There are also some other key points about Ronin-SC I\u2019d like to highlight:\n\n* Compatible Camera List\n\nAs most of you already know, the new Ronin SC is mainly compatible with mirrorless cameras, it's also suitable for professional level photographers now, and you can check if your camera is compatible with Ronin-SC in below list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/4urc9hkyi0c31.png\n\n* **Quick Release and Easy-to-Setup**\n\nWhile DJI\u2019s Ronin-S and Ronin-SC both have a detachable design that allows users to easily dissemble and transport, Ronin-SC offers even easier setup with its \u201cpositioning block\u201d, which allows quick switch back to the previous position.\n\nIn addition, Ronin-SC has 2 locks for each axis that makes gimbal balancing much easier. While moving from one shooting spot to another, you can easily lock and unlock all the axes. It can save up a lot of time.\n\n* **Intelligent Functions**\n\n\u2460 ActiveTrack 3.0\n\nDJI has added a new intelligent function \u201cActiveTrack\u201d into Ronin-SC. It\u2019s used to select and track your subject during filming process super effectively. This is even better than Ronin-S\u2019s SmoothTrack function. But this probably has pissed off some old DJI Ronin-S users as this function is not availble on Ronin-S yet.\n\n\u2461 ForceMobile\n\nThis function is definitely designed for professional users who want to have the most accurate control of frames, by allowing users to control Ronin-SC by simply moving their smartphones. It's totally like Freefly movie system. So for a small team shooting a video that involves complcated camera movements this feature could come in handy.\n\nLastly, the price of Ronin-SC is quite reasonable and competitive among all the gimbal products and plus DJI Ronin-SC is also covered by DJI Care Refresh plan. It is likely that Zhiyun will also drop in price before long, but as a big fan of DJI, truth is I will still pick Ronin-SC even if the price is becoming higher than WL...", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/cgpv0j/dji_roninsc_vs_zhiyun_weebill_lab_comparison_and/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "dji ronin-sc vs zhiyun weebill lab comparison and in-depth review /!/ after one year, dji is releasing another professional gimbal product \u2014 ronin-sc, which is only half the size and weight of ronin-s. comparing to the other competling 3-axis gimbal, zhiyun, you may be wondering which is the better one to choose?

Additionally, there are starting to be a few excellent cheaper primes, such as the [Samyang 45](https://dustinabbott.net/2019/08/samyang-af-45mm-f1-8-fe-review/).\n* Best in class AF\n* Best battery life\n* A7III (current production model) [has perhaps marginally](https://www.dxomark.com/sony-a7-iii-low-light-performer/) the best high ISO of any model.\n\nCons: \n\n* Though Sony cameras certainly can take a [bit of abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ric_RH-Xm1Q) ([example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmrjI0-9KJs)) they do have [tested](https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2018/02/taking-apart-the-sony-a7riii-in-search-of-better-weather-sealing/) ([example 2](https://blog.kasson.com/a7iii/sony-a7iii-battery-door-weather-sealing/)) shortcomings in regards to sealing.\n* While recent lenses are certainly [good performers](https://www.cameralabs.com/sony-fe-35mm-f1-8-review/2/), the only non G or GM lens that has any sealing is the 35mm. As most modern lenses perform well optically, this can lower the value proposition of much of their native enthusiast glass.  \n* Arguably the worst ergonomics unless you have small hands. \n\n**Nikon**\n\nPros:\n\n* Their S line has some real gems ([see 50mm vs Otus](https://blog.kasson.com/nikon-z6-7/nikon-50-1-8-s-otus-55-on-z7-zony-55-on-a7riii/), [24-70 2.8](https://www.cameralabs.com/nikon-z-24-70mm-f2-8-s-review/2/)) and all are at the very least excellent lenses. Furthermore, the S line and the Z bodies are probably [neck and neck](https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2018/10/teardown-of-the-nikon-z7-mirrorless-camera/) with L-mount offerings for best weather sealing for non-Pentax cameras. Additionally, as the S line lenses are all cheaper than the Batis line I'd say they're probably the best value proposition for high end enthusiasts.\n* The Z line is the only line to release [10-bit video for free](https://www.cinema5d.com/nikon-z6-z7-focusing-on-video-quality-explained/). You can even capture 10-bit internal! \n* Theoretically, as the Z line has the least restrictive mount they can make the best lenses. However, while the 58 0.95 might just be the [best lens ever made for that focal length](https://www.cameralabs.com/nikon-z-58mm-f0-95-noct-review/2/) actual lens design plays a part. The aforementioned 50 1.8s certainly seems to be following that promise, but they don't seem to have the best lens for every focal length. Still, you might see more crazy things done for this mount than any other. \n* Lightest, smallest, and best performing 24-70 2.8 on the market atm. The title of optical quality king might be taken away when someone releases tests (haven't found any) for the Canon RF 24-70 or if Sigma's new offering for E and L mount cameras delivers on the promise of [GOAT standard zoom](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/cas/product/art/a019_24_70_28/features/), but it will always be the lightest and smallest 24-70 2.8. \n\nCons:\n\n* Arguably worst AF for any modern offering. This isn't to say that it's *bad* or *unusable*, but it's still disappointing. \n* While CF Express cards are undeniably the most advanced, they're also the most expensive. \n\n**Canon**\n\nPros:\n\n* While their native glass isn't as extensive as that available for the E-mount, their professional line (re: f 1.2 lenses) is probably the best on market for any system. \n* All of their professional zooms have built in OIS that will be a boon when they one day also have IBIS (and *maaaaaaybe* no crop in 4k).
