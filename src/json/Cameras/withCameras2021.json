I'm sure you get a million of these types of posts, but I need some help.\n\nI'm looking to purchase my mom (54 y/o) a relatively nice camera, as she loves documenting her life experiences. I was hoping to get some suggestions from some experienced users, so I humbly turn to the r/Cameras community.\n\n- I know very little about cameras beyond the basics, and there's just so much information out there to parse through on my own and come up with an informed purchase decision.\n\n- I also don't know anything about lenses, so I definitely need guidance on a good, all-around starter lens.\n\n- This became much longer than I intended it to be. TL;DR at the bottom if you'd like to skip the details.\n\n---\n\n**Budget**\n\n- $400.00 to cover camera and lens. I will consider stretching the budget to $500.00 if given an extremely compelling option. I will cover taxes above this budget, so the whole budget can be allocated to the tech.\n- If I can get her one of those starter bundles that would be great, but if choosing between lower quality + bundle vs higher quality + starter lens, I would opt for the latter.\n- I will buy her secondary necessities, such as carry case basic tri-pod, extra memory cards, etc at a later date independent of the current budget, as I have plenty of time to do that before she leaves.\n\n---\n**Use-Case Details**\n\n- She will primarily be taking pictures, but she absolutely does like to take short videos from time to time, and I'd like her to be able to that with the camera we get. 30fps is ok, 60fps preferable but not make-or-break. Picture quality is the higher priority.\n- Subject matter is overall what you'd expect of someone who just wants to document their life and travel experiences in general. Nature, landscape, animals, people, and architecture would make up 90% of the subject matter.\n- In terms of photography skill, she would be considered \"amateur\". Definitely not inept by any means, just about what you'd expect of someone who enjoys taking photos of their family and life.\n- In terms of hardware technical know-how, this would be the biggest learning curve. She hasn't had much experience with modern cameras or hardware.
