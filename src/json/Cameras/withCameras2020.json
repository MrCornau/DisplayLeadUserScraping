I am only a hobbyist and I don\u2019t rely on photography as a source of income. I take mostly travel and street photography with some landscape and portrait that naturally occur while on travel. I have 2 main reasons why I want a new lens - 1st is low light performance. One example was when I was on a dinner cruise and couldn\u2019t capture any photos without bumping the ISO up to 6400. I really think a fast Prime lens would have helped a lot in this case. 2nd is focal length although this might have been more situational. We went to an open zoo/reserve and 55mm was nowhere near enough to capture the animals and shows the way I wanted to. Here I feel like a longer zoom would have helped tremendously. On further reflection though, how often do I really go on zoos or watch theatrical performances from a distance - probably not so much. Then again, having the option of having a lens with a long focal length would be good to have.\n\nI am also struggling between the old Prime vs. Zoom argument. I do feel like I should get a Prime for both the practical aspects as well as for improving my own skill by being locked to a fixed focal point but I feel like I was \u201cspoiled\u201d by starting with a zoom lens and I feel like I would miss quite a lot of shots if I were to use a Prime.\n\nI really want something to compliment the 18-55 rather than replace it as I really love the lens. After a lot of research and thinking, I have come up with the following options in order of what I think is best for my situation:\n\n1. XC 35mm F2 and Viltrox 85mm F1.8 - 2 lenses for the price of 1 XF lens. Both are very fast lenses and from what I\u2019ve read are very sharp. The only negatives here are neither are XF lenses and both are Primes but those aren\u2019t really a negative.\n\n2. XF 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 - A zoom lens that would compliment the 18-55 beautifully. Negative is it\u2019s a zoom so it\u2019s not as fast or as sharp as Primes. Also I don\u2019t get any low light advantages a Prime would provide.\n\n3. XF 16mm F1.4 - Lots of good reviews for this lens, the 16mm and F1.4 as well as super close min focus distance allow for a lot of creative and unique shots which I do wish to learn and experience. The big negative for this lens is it\u2019s not very versatile. Super wide angle requires a lot of shot composition and no classic/lazy flattering portrait shots allowed. For landscape I feel the 18mm on the kit would also work similarly to this lens especially since the F1.4 aperture wouldn\u2019t matter in this case though I could be wrong.\n\n4. XF 50-140mm F2.8 - This one is the red badge monster and a big part of me wanting this feels more emotional than anything practical. Feels like the opposite of my 1st option which is the most practical but less \u201cexciting\u201d option.\n\n5. 23mm F2 or 35mm F2 - The most common all-rounders. I just feel like the kit lens does well enough @23mm and the existence of the XC 35mm F2 for half the price really makes these lenses a tough buy for me.\n\nThese are my options. If you were in my situation, what would you get? Feel free to recommend other lenses as well. Another thing I might have glanced over is budget, I am willing to shell out as long as it gives the best results for the money It costs.\n\nSorry for the long post, if you have made it this far, thanks for your time and advice!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/fgfdwe/fujifilm_xt30_lens_recommendations/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "fujifilm x-t30 lens recommendations? /!/ trouble deciding what should be my 1st lens for my fujifilm x-t30 after the xf 18-55 f2.8-4.\n\ni know lenses are subjective and it\u2019s hard to recommend one so i will try to explain my needs as best as i can, so please bare with me.\n\ni absolutely love the kit lens and the sharpness and versatility it provides. i am only a hobbyist and i don\u2019t rely on photography as a source of income. i take mostly travel and street photography with some landscape and portrait that naturally occur while on travel. i have 2 main reasons why i want a new lens - 1st is low light performance. one example was when i was on a dinner cruise and couldn\u2019t capture any photos without bumping the iso up to 6400. i really think a fast prime lens would have helped a lot in this case. 2nd is focal length although this might have been more situational. we went to an open zoo/reserve and 55mm was nowhere near enough to capture the animals and shows the way i wanted to. here i feel like a longer zoom would have helped tremendously. on further reflection though, how often do i really go on zoos or watch theatrical performances from a distance - probably not so much. then again, having the option of having a lens with a long focal length would be good to have.\n\ni am also struggling between the old prime vs. zoom argument. i do feel like i should get a prime for both the practical aspects as well as for improving my own skill by being locked to a fixed focal point but i feel like i was \u201cspoiled\u201d by starting with a zoom lens and i feel like i would miss quite a lot of shots if i were to use a prime.\n\ni really want something to compliment the 18-55 rather than replace it as i really love the lens. after a lot of research and thinking, i have -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  the following options in order of what i think is best for my situation:\n\n1. xc 35mm f2 and viltrox 85mm f1.8 - 2 lenses for the price of 1 xf lens. both are very fast lenses and from what i\u2019ve read are very sharp. the only negatives here are neither are xf lenses and both are primes but those aren\u2019t really a negative.\n\n2. xf 55-200mm f3.5-4.8 - a zoom lens that would compliment the 18-55 beautifully. negative is it\u2019s a zoom so it\u2019s not as fast or as sharp as primes. also i don\u2019t get any low light advantages a prime would provide.\n\n3. xf 16mm f1.4 - lots of good reviews for this lens, the 16mm and f1.4 as well as super close min focus distance allow for a lot of creative and unique shots which i do wish to learn and experience. the big negative for this lens is it\u2019s not very versatile. super wide angle requires a lot of shot composition and no classic/lazy flattering portrait shots allowed. for landscape i feel the 18mm on the kit would also work similarly to this lens especially since the f1.4 aperture wouldn\u2019t matter in this case though i could be wrong.\n\n4. xf 50-140mm f2.8 - this one is the red badge monster and a big part of me wanting this feels more emotional than anything practical. feels like the opposite of my 1st option which is the most practical but less \u201cexciting\u201d option.\n\n5. 23mm f2 or 35mm f2 - the most common all-rounders. i just feel like the kit lens does well enough @23mm and the existence of the xc 35mm f2 for half the price really makes these lenses a tough buy for me.\n\nthese are my options. if you were in my situation, what would you get? feel free to recommend other lenses as well. another thing i might have glanced over is budget, i am willing to shell out as long as it gives the best results for the money it costs.\n\nsorry for the long post, if you have made it this far, thanks for your time and advice!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 1560, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Robonellz", "date": "2020-01-13 07:35:51", "content": "Olympus OM-D EM10 ii -VS- Nikon D3500 /!/ I\u2019m looking for a smaller lightweight capable digital camera under $500.

Thoughts? /!/ Looking at the market there seem to be two approaches, the MASP selection and fuji's dedicated dials each featuring an A option. Both having some advantages as some disadvantages.\n\nThere also 3 distinct setting scenarios.  \nThe full automatic, point and shoot experience, ideal for amateur users or more lighthearted momments such as a family party.  \nFull manual, optimal for studio work, flash use, long exposure and cases where speed and losing the moment arent such important factors as absolute control over the settings.  \nHaving most possible control over the settings while still relying on some automation to achive the fast and snappy workflow that manual doesnt offer. This also means that camera would preferably have to control only one parameter at a time.\n\nThe priority modes come from the film era where iso was a fixed value so there where only two changable parameters.

The answer is simple.  \nInstead of choosing the most importnt parameter to control (which almost always is the aperture), you should have to choose the less important parameter to be the one set to auto. While obviously still retaining the option of full manual and auto.\n\nFuji's interface offers a similar logic, but since professionals rarely have two parameters set to auto, to change the automated parameter from one to another, say from only auto speed to only auto iso. You have to rotate the first one from A all the way to the preferred value and then rotate the other all the way to A, which is a slow two step process.

In the case of moving subjects, your setting would be something like, widest f stop, and slowest possible speed that would still be able to freeze the action (according to your focal length) and auto iso.
