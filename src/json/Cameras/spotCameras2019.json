It has the 18-55mm kit lens and I have a 55-200mm, although I generally just use a Nikkor 35mm 1.8f on it\n\nI\u2019m exploring the possibility of moving either to M4/3 (I\u2019d love to think that a new Pen-F may be in the pipeline) or to something else smaller, such as the Fujifilm X100F or Fujifilm X-T20.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is a daft question, but I\u2019m keen to know if the cameras I\u2019ve just mentioned would be a step up in terms of image quality or whether I would be trading size and convenience for quality. I know that an up-to-date DSLR would beat these smaller formats at a similar price point, but just wonder if my eight or so years old DSLR is now behind the curve compared with these.\n\nBy analogy, I usually buy a new computer every four or five years or so, alternating between replacing my laptop and replacing my desktop. As a rule, I only buy a new laptop when the price and power developments are such that the laptop is now a more capable model than my desktop, aside from portability. So while I\u2019d appreciate the move from my DSLR to a more compact and portable model, I only want to do this if the camera will be a better proposition aside from the size convenience.\n\nMost of the photos I take are just for on-screen consumption and I certainly don\u2019t need something bursting with pixels so that I can make unfeasibly huge prints from my pictures. If I\u2019m honest, my photographic \u201cneeds\u201d could probably be largely met by current phone camera but aside from anything else there\u2019s something I like about having a dedicated camera \u2014 I like having a proper viewfinder, and separately there\u2019s something about getting hold of one\u2019s camera to take pictures rather than just slipping my phone out of a pocket that I enjoy.\n\nCould I bank on each of the cameras I\u2019ve mentioned having better focusing than the old DSLR I\u2019m currently using? A lot of my shots come out unfocused (and I don\u2019t doubt that some of this is my own lack of proficiency) so will this situation be improved by some of the new eye-recognition focus developments, or will the general truism that DSLR autofocus is better than compact autofocus hold true, with me being disappointed by any new purchase.\n\nIf it helps for any recommendations, I should mention that most of the photographs I take are just portraits or everyday snaps. I would like to get into street photography, but live in a country where there\u2019s a general wariness of people photographing on the streets. As a result a small camera could be a plus, although a possible irony is that it\u2019s perhaps better to be snapping with a big DSLR that says \u201cI\u2019m doing nothing furtive\u201d rather than a discreet camera that when spotted gives the possible impression of sneakiness. I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAnyhow, sorry that this is a bit of a ramble. Essentially I just want to know if moving from a Nikon D3100 to a M4/3, probably just using a prime that isn\u2019t too expensive, would be a move up or down in terms of overall photographic experience, again putting aside the issues of weight. (I really don\u2019t mind carrying my current camera around, or at least I don\u2019t mind it enough to want to spend $800 to $1200 for something lighter but less capable.) I\u2019ve tried searching here and elsewhere, but don\u2019t really find anything that quite answers this.\n\nI\u2019m posting this in more than one subreddit.
