I just graduated college and I'm looking to buy myself a graduation gift. \n* I originally thought I was going to buy the Sony ZV-1 but quickly realized it wouldn't provide the *look* I'm going for. I want something a little more advanced than your typical iphone/point+shoot.\n* This is my first *significant* purchase so it's important for me to make the right decision so that I'm not wasting money in the long run.\n* I need help choosing the best system AND lenses (I am truly clueless about how to pick out a lens)\n* My family currently has a 2008 Nikon D40 with a Tamron 18-200mm lens. The lens is broken, slides down on its own, and is probably scratched due to poor handling by my family. The camera focuses poorly and there''s a lot of blur when I take a photo. \n* I've used another family member's Canon 60D and I never enjoyed the ergonomics. Canon and Nikon are so damn bulky. I have small hands.\n\n### Use Case / Needs / Wants\n\n\n* Hybrid -- more emphasis on photography, with some video clips \n* Pure hobbyist, starting out (but not super entry level)\n* Portable -- something I can throw in a medium sized handbag \n* I mainly want to shoot advanced selfies with a pixel intervalometer when I go on an *adventure* \n* Biking, hiking, day trips into the countryside/city, travel, pets at the pet park, family/friends, candids\n* Will not be used for studio. Purely outdoor and natural lighting \n* I also want to make b-roll style short video clips (slowmo panning, etc) so some *stabilization* is important to me. Probably won't do any walking+talking vlogs ever. \n* I need it to connect to my phone's app so I can frame my shot and see myself on the cell phone from far away\n* I'd like to maybe do time lapses so that I can photograph movement, so that it can continuously take pictures as I dance around, then I can just pick out a frame within the time lapse. Or am I thinking of this wrong?\n* Some kind of flipping screen so I can see/frame myself with the camera \n\n### Budget\n\n* Because I'm just a hobbyist and don't plan on making any money or doing anything serious, I can't justify spending $2000+ on a body and lens\n* I technically *can* spend more. I've saved enough. But it would make feel bad if I did (unless convinced otherwise) I hope that makes sense.\n* My ideal budget is around $1000-$1500 USD plus minus a few hundred for both body AND lens \n* I don't know if 6 months from now I'll stop the hobby and end up using the camera twice a year. \n* I don't know if I'll completely fall in love and end up itching to upgrade, thus making a low quality purchase a waste of money\n* One thing is for sure: I want to be *more serious* about traveling, especially alone. And I would love to capture those moments on a *good quality camera.*\n\n### Crop or Full Frame\n\n* Okay so here is the thing. I've watched over 300 youtube videos on my quest to research the best camera for me. \n* I quickly realized that I really enjoyed *the look* of higher end full frame cameras. \n* Canon backgrounds are smooth like butter *chefs kiss*\n* Sony A7iii (S/R) also produced ideal photographs \n* But I think they are out of my budget\n* I can't justify the $3000 price tag on the Canon\n* Or $2000+ for the Sony\n* These cameras have the *ideal* photo look and I may upgrade to them in the future if I do become more serious / find a job a save up to upgrade\n* But do I really want to waste $1400 on the a6600 crop sensor when I can just pay a few hundred more for a full frame? This is my dilemma. Where do I draw the line? This is where I need your help\n* I don't know what I don't know. So all of your advice and insights are appreciated for helping me consider all my options. Perhaps I overlooked a feature that I didn't know I needed that a specific camera has?\n\n### Cameras and Lenses\n\n* Here is a link of how I envision my photos to look like: \n* https://imgur.com/a/6vKeNML\n* **What body and lenses do I need to buy to achieve that kind of look?** (obviously excluding the editing)\n* Example of what I don't like (typical iphone style): https://i.imgur.com/waA7bJV.png\n* Top 3 Examples of my ideal \"look\": 1) https://i.imgur.com/skjgg97.png 2) https://i.imgur.com/5ey2mjR.png 3) https://i.imgur.com/4XYZIyQ.png\n* Video clip example of the look I like (first 17 seconds only): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UsZMbHhZTk\n* Cameras I've considered:\n* Sony a7iii (a little too pricey), Sony a6600, Sony a6400\n* Olympus EM1 Mark ii/iii - but they're going out of business so I don't want an obsolete camera \n* Fuji XS10, XT3, XT4 (pricey, also they're upgrading the sensor with the next model)\n* Canon EOS RP (bulky)\n\nIf $3000 was my budget I would without a doubt buy the Sony A7iii in a heartbeat. But IDK if I can justify that price point right now as someone who is starting out. Should I? Should I just bite the bullet without dipping my toes first with a $1000 camera instead? \n\nI need your help reddit!

this is my dilemma. where do i draw the line? this is where i need your help\n* i don't know what i don't know. so all of your advice and insights are appreciated for helping me consider all my options. perhaps i overlooked a feature that i didn't know i needed that a specific camera has?\n\n### cameras and lenses\n\n* here is a link of how i envision my photos to look like: \n* https://imgur.com/a/6vkenml\n* **what body and lenses do i need to buy to achieve that kind of look?** (obviously excluding the editing)\n* example of what i don't like (typical iphone style): https://i.imgur.com/waa7bjv.png\n* top 3 examples of my ideal \"look\": 1) https://i.imgur.com/skjgg97.png 2) https://i.imgur.com/5ey2mjr.png 3) https://i.imgur.com/4xyziyq.png\n* video clip example of the look i like (first 17 seconds only): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uszmbhhztk\n* cameras i've considered:\n* sony a7iii (a little too pricey), sony a6600, sony a6400\n* olympus em1 mark ii/iii - but they're going out of business so i don't want an obsolete camera \n* fuji xs10, xt3, xt4 (pricey, also they're upgrading the sensor with the next model)\n* canon eos rp (bulky)\n\nif $3000 was my budget i would without a doubt buy the sony a7iii in a heartbeat. but idk if i can justify that price point right now as someone who is starting out. should i?

I will use the camera mainly for landscape photography and videos, but also for city scapes and family photos / videos.  With that being said, I do value compactness and lighter weight options.\n\nMy budget is $2,000 for the camera body, starting lens(es), and a decent tripod. I can go up a bit in budget if there is a worthwhile upgrade for future proofing the set up. I am the type that likes to jump in head first into my hobbies and have the buy it for life mentality most of the time and try to avoid needless upgrades (though I gather this hobby often progresses to the point of being a money pit haha).\n\nCurrently not planning on doing post production, as I do not own any editing software, however I might decide to get into this in the future. Would prefer a camera that produces solid photos / videos without the need to perform post production editing.\n\nAfter thorough research, I am currently leaning towards the following options:\n  - Sony a6400 body only\n  - Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) What do you guys think of the a6400? I see a lot of contrasting opinions - many praise it as having amazing bang for your buck and very versatile, while I\u2019ve also seen people saying it is outdated and Sony will soon shift all their focus on the full frame line up. Also I see a lot of complaints regarding the clunky menu set up. Thoughts on this? Are there any other cameras I should be looking at?\n\n2) I want to get a zoom lens for my first lens, as I want a versatile lens that I can bring on hikes that can do nearly everything to avoid carrying multiple lens. I also figure it will be a good first lens because it will allow me to figure out what my favorite range to shoot at is, so that I can decide which Sigma prime lens I want to get first to supplement my tool kit. I was initially considering the Sony 18-105mm f/4.0 lens instead of the Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8, but from research it seems to me like I\u2019d be better off with the Tamron. Seems as though the only benefit on the Sony would be the additional range (which I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll miss the ability to zoom in that far), and the fact that the lens adjustment is internal, so if I decide to get a gimbal in the future it will be better suited for this.  Would you guys agree with my logic? Is there a different lens you\u2019d recommend instead?\n\n3) My understanding is that there is speculation that the Sony a7iv will be released in October 2021. I would imagine that the release of this camera would result in price drops for the Sony a7iii and the a6400. Is this typically how that works out? I\u2019d love to go full frame, but the a7iii is out of my price range\nFrom what I am seeing on the a6600, the improvements over the a6400 do not warrant the x2 price tag. Thoughts? The a6400 does not have IBIS but many of the available lenses (including Tamron lens I am planning on getting) have lens stabilization. Is lens stabilization equivalent to IBIS? If I have IBIS of the A6600, does having a lens with lens stabilization noticeably increase performance, or is it unnecessary at that point?\n\n4) What lightweight mini tri-pod would you recommend?\n\n5) Would the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 be a solid second lens? Is that a good range for my first prime lens, or should I go with the Sigma 56mm f/1.4?\n\n\nAppreciate your help and open to hear any other suggestions / input!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/puqn6z/please_help_me_chose_my_first_camera/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "please help me chose my first camera! /!/ i am looking for a versatile camera that is capable of making quality video and photographs.  i will use the camera mainly for landscape photography and videos, but also for city scapes and family photos / videos.  with that being said, i do value compactness and lighter weight options.\n\nmy budget is $2,000 for the camera body, starting lens(es), and a decent tripod. i can go up a bit in budget if there is a worthwhile upgrade for future proofing the set up. i am the type that likes to jump in head first into my hobbies and have the buy it for life mentality most of the time and try to avoid needless upgrades (though i gather this hobby often progresses to the point of being a money pit haha).\n\ncurrently not planning on doing post production, as i do not own any editing software, however i might decide to get into this in the future. would prefer a camera that produces solid photos / videos without the need to perform post production editing.\n\nafter thorough research, i am currently leaning towards the following options:\n  - sony a6400 body only\n  - tamron 17-70mm f/2.8\n\n\nquestions:\n\n1) what do you guys think of the a6400? i see a lot of contrasting opinions - many praise it as having amazing bang for your buck and very versatile, while i\u2019ve also seen people saying it is outdated and sony will soon shift all their focus on the full frame line up. also i see a lot of complaints regarding the clunky menu set up. thoughts on this? are there any other cameras i should be looking at?\n\n2) i want to get a zoom lens for my first lens, as i want a versatile lens that i can bring on hikes that can do nearly everything to avoid carrying multiple lens. i also figure it will be a good first lens because it will allow me to figure out what my favorite range to shoot at is, so that i can decide which sigma prime lens i want to get first to supplement my tool kit. i was initially considering the sony 18-105mm f/4.0 lens instead of the tamron 17-70mm f/2.8, but from research it seems to me like i\u2019d be better off with the tamron. seems as though the only benefit on the sony would be the additional range (which i don\u2019t believe i\u2019ll miss the ability to zoom in that far), and the fact that the lens adjustment is internal, so if i decide to get a gimbal in the future it will be better suited for this.  would you guys agree with my logic? is there a different lens you\u2019d recommend instead?\n\n3) my understanding is that there is speculation that the sony a7iv will be released in october 2021. i would imagine that the release of this camera would result in price drops for the sony a7iii and the a6400. is this typically how that works out? i\u2019d love to go full frame, but the a7iii is out of my price range\nfrom what i am seeing on the a6600, the improvements over the a6400 do not warrant the x2 price -----> tag !!! . thoughts? the a6400 does not have ibis but many of the available lenses (including tamron lens i am planning on getting) have lens stabilization. is lens stabilization equivalent to ibis? if i have ibis of the a6600, does having a lens with lens stabilization noticeably increase performance, or is it unnecessary at that point?\n\n4) what lightweight mini tri-pod would you recommend?\n\n5) would the sigma 30mm f/1.4 be a solid second lens? is that a good range for my first prime lens, or should i go with the sigma 56mm f/1.4?\n\n\nappreciate your help and open to hear any other suggestions / input!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 21434, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 226902, "autor": "thetravelingpinecone", "date": 1633657900000, "content": "Nikon Z6 vs. Sony A7ii /!/ Hi there!

Lower price tag also allows me to spend more on a tripod and other extras for the camera while still coming in at about the same price as a basic Sony or Nikon kit. Lawded for snappy autofocus and, being a Canon, good skin-tones. Seems to be more of an \"if you wanna get a camera and just, you know, have a decent camera\" kinda buy rather than a full-on \"I could dive into the ekosystem and grow with this camera\".\n\n\n2. Notes on extra stuff: no matter what camera I'll get, I won't spend any leftover cash on extra glass, I'd like to start out with the kit lens and find out what focal lengths I film and photograph the most at. I should also be able to borrow a Manfrotto tripod if I can't fit a decent one into the budget, and I've already got some decent (though not studio perfect) lighting that is at least passable for now.\n\n3. Budget cap: budget caps out around 1100 euro for the camera with kit lens, as extra battery, SD cards etc are gonna push it another 100 or so (not to mention a microphone for another 50-150 euro), so the RP + lens is out of the running due to local prices (kits from 1350 and up).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/poanxd/a_camera_for_vlogs_and_macro_photography/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "a camera for vlogs and macro photography? /!/ long story short, i build a lot of miniatures, have a very small but growing instagram with pictures off my phone camera and i've always wanted to get into the combo-style vlog of maker + lifestyle/hangout.\n\nfor this, i'm looking for a mirrorless camera as i'd want it portable and able to mount on a limb hanging over my workspace. i'm after good, snappy autofocus and 4k shooting is not a requirement (although it is a nice bonus). bonus points for decent lowlight and good access to a future macro-lens upgrade for those sweet, sweet instagram shots.\n\nanything between 14 and 28mm equivalent zooming up to a 70-85mm equivalent in the kit lens would be ideal.\n\ni have little to no experience with cameras outside of my phone and i'm looking for something i can grow with and possibly start going into the lense eco-system of the brand with if i get a tester for more.\n\nafter a good several hours of researching, here are three cameras and some notes on budget and initial purchase:\n\n1. cameras.\n\nsony a6400, recommended by most youtubers and reviews, access to a good series of lenses and seems to be a solid camera for several years to come, even if at the \"entry level point\" today.\n\nnikon z fc; as far as i can tell, recommended by the cult of nikon who could never go back to any other brand, supposedly has great (but few) lenses (though it can be adapted to take more) and, turns out, my family has a small set of lenses, from a prime 35 to a telephoto and a tamron alround zoom-lense of some sort.\n\ncanon eos m50 mk ii: recommended by several youtubers, and in particular one who used to be a professional photographer and then went full-time as a hobby-tuber within the same hobby. lower price -----> tag !!!  also allows me to spend more on a tripod and other extras for the camera while still coming in at about the same price as a basic sony or nikon kit. lawded for snappy autofocus and, being a canon, good skin-tones. seems to be more of an \"if you wanna get a camera and just, you know, have a decent camera\" kinda buy rather than a full-on \"i could dive into the ekosystem and grow with this camera\".\n\n\n2. notes on extra stuff: no matter what camera i'll get, i won't spend any leftover cash on extra glass, i'd like to start out with the kit lens and find out what focal lengths i film and photograph the most at. i should also be able to borrow a manfrotto tripod if i can't fit a decent one into the budget, and i've already got some decent (though not studio perfect) lighting that is at least passable for now.\n\n3. budget cap: budget caps out around 1100 euro for the camera with kit lens, as extra battery, sd cards etc are gonna push it another 100 or so (not to mention a microphone for another 50-150 euro), so the rp + lens is out of the running due to local prices (kits from 1350 and up).", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 22987, "year": "2021"}], "name": "tagCameras2021"}
