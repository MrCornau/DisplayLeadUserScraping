I got it for $1300 at the time and it came with a 16-50 f2.8 lens. My main passion was shooting sports (ultimate frisbee) and wildlife. I also ended up buying a g master 70-200 f2.8 for this purpose. I created lots of awesome photos, but at some point something happened to my system where parts of my picture seem blurry and I more than likely would need to take it in to get fixed. My main issue is there is very little support for a-mounts with Sony, and will be next to no support going forward so instead of spending a good amount of money to fix my system, I have decided to invest in a system with a bright future.\n\nI was constantly switching between Sony mirrorless and Nikon in general. The appeal of Nikons mirrorless wasn\u2019t really there for me considering how new they were and didn\u2019t look to great to me spec wise. As far was Sony goes I was debating either a a7iii or an a9 if I decided to save up for the more expensive body. After going to a local camera store, I got to hold a lot of these cameras to at least get somewhat of a feel for them. I was blown away by how good the Nikon mirrorless felt in my hand. It really felt like a smaller more compact DSLR and had as good of a grip of one. I tried holding some canons for good measure and my god the EOS R just feels like shit in my hands. Like a legit metal brick. Blech. Sony still felt nice, but I would\u2019ve liked if they put the same rubber grip that Nikon does for its mirrorless.\n\nAfter this I felt more confident in my decision making as how a camera feels in hand does play a large part in what you choose. So now I\u2019m debating either the Z6 which has more FPS, or the Z7 which has less FPS but more pixels, more autofocus points, and just more upgraded features for a bigger price. Only other factor which would make me not go Nikon is how Sony feels much lighter in hands, and already has a good array of lenses for what I need whereas I\u2019d need to wait for Nikon to come out with wildlife/ sports lenses and not use an adapter for their F mounts.\n\n\nDo any of you have any thoughts or opinions on what you would choose?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/c4izom/i_have_finally_decided_on_getting_a_nikon_but/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "i created", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "i have finally decided on getting a nikon, but need help /!/ tl;dr trying to decide between a z6 or a z7 for sports/wildlife. \n\nso awhile back i had purchased a sony a77ii which was a fantastic camera. i got it for $1300 at the time and it came with a 16-50 f2.8 lens. my main passion was shooting sports (ultimate frisbee) and wildlife. i also ended up buying a g master 70-200 f2.8 for this purpose. -----> i !!!  -----> created !!!  lots of awesome photos, but at some point something happened to my system where parts of my picture seem blurry and -----> i !!!  more than likely would need to take it in to get fixed. my main issue is there is very little support for a-mounts with sony, and will be next to no support going forward so instead of spending a good amount of money to fix my system, i have decided to invest in a system with a bright future.\n\ni was constantly switching between sony mirrorless and nikon in general. the appeal of nikons mirrorless wasn\u2019t really there for me considering how new they were and didn\u2019t look to great to me spec wise. as far was sony goes i was debating either a a7iii or an a9 if i decided to save up for the more expensive body. after going to a local camera store, i got to hold a lot of these cameras to at least get somewhat of a feel for them. i was blown away by how good the nikon mirrorless felt in my hand. it really felt like a smaller more compact dslr and had as good of a grip of one. i tried holding some canons for good measure and my god the eos r just feels like shit in my hands. like a legit metal brick. blech. sony still felt nice, but i would\u2019ve liked if they put the same rubber grip that nikon does for its mirrorless.\n\nafter this i felt more confident in my decision making as how a camera feels in hand does play a large part in what you choose. so now i\u2019m debating either the z6 which has more fps, or the z7 which has less fps but more pixels, more autofocus points, and just more upgraded features for a bigger price. only other factor which would make me not go nikon is how sony feels much lighter in hands, and already has a good array of lenses for what i need whereas i\u2019d need to wait for nikon to come out with wildlife/ sports lenses and not use an adapter for their f mounts.\n\n\ndo any of you have any thoughts or opinions on what you would choose?", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 78538, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Icebearltu", "date": "2019-07-10 19:30:43", "content": "SELLING SERVICES&gt;&gt;&gt; Creating Clean Websites &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; /!/ If you\u2019re looking for a fully functional WordPress website that meets the needs of the ever-changing world-wide-web, then look no further!\n\nWhy you should work with us\n\nWe Highly Focus On:\n\n\u00b7 Efficiency\n\n\u00b7 Accuracy\n\n\u00b7 On Time Delivery\n\n\u00b7 Customer Satisfaction\n\n\u00b7 Quality Product Delivery\n\nPrivate message me for more info or is interested to my services", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/cbl94s/selling_services_creating_clean_websites/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "selling services&gt;&gt;&gt; -----> creating !!!  clean websites &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; /!/ if you\u2019re looking for a fully functional wordpress website that meets the needs of the ever-changing world-wide-web, then look no further!\n\nwhy you should work with us\n\nwe highly focus on:\n\n\u00b7 efficiency\n\n\u00b7 accuracy\n\n\u00b7 on time delivery\n\n\u00b7 customer satisfaction\n\n\u00b7 quality product delivery\n\nprivate message me for more info or is interested to my services", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 80756, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "crepuscopoli", "date": "2019-08-12 20:29:05", "content": "Im not sure if i need 4k!
