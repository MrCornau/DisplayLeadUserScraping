The problem is that it seems like the entry-level space has been gutted because of phones, so I'm having trouble coming up with a camera that fits both our needs and budget. Reading mainstream tech review sites (CNet and the like) is unfulfilling because they seem to have varying judging criteria, while going to dedicated photography sites makes you feel like you're going to get a real piece of crap if you don't spend a lot of money. So the more I look around on my own the muddier the water seems to get.\n\nWhat we want:\n\n\\- Good optical zoom.\n\n\\- Good dim/indoor light performance.\n\n\\- Reasonable video taking ability, but doesn't need to be 4K.\n\n\\- Some form of wireless connectivity for picture transfer, preferably to phones.\n\nWhat we'd like, but isn't mandatory:\n\n\\- Touchscreen.\n\n\\- A good variety of shooting modes and filters.\n\n\\- Fast shutter speed (she's a toddler, it's hard to get a picture where she's not moving.)\n\n\\- Physical view finder (this one is the lowest priority, because my wife doesn't care at all about that, but I kind of want it.)\n\nWe'd like to keep the price under $300 CDN, but there's some flexibility if it's a really good deal or a camera with a must-have feature/function.\n\nThanks for any advice you can give! And if I'm expecting too much camera for too little money, feel free to tell me to go stuff myself. At least I'll know to lower my expectations.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/c6zksy/looking_for_a_digital_camera_recommendation_canada/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "coming up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "looking for a digital camera recommendation (canada) /!/ my wife and i are getting tired of the limitations our phone cameras for taking pictures of our daughter, so we're looking at getting an entry-level camera. the problem is that it seems like the entry-level space has been gutted because of phones, so i'm having trouble -----> coming !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  a camera that fits both our needs and budget. reading mainstream tech review sites (cnet and the like) is unfulfilling because they seem to have varying judging criteria, while going to dedicated photography sites makes you feel like you're going to get a real piece of crap if you don't spend a lot of money. so the more i look around on my own the muddier the water seems to get.\n\nwhat we want:\n\n\\- good optical zoom.\n\n\\- good dim/indoor light performance.\n\n\\- reasonable video taking ability, but doesn't need to be 4k.\n\n\\- some form of wireless connectivity for picture transfer, preferably to phones.\n\nwhat we'd like, but isn't mandatory:\n\n\\- touchscreen.\n\n\\- a good variety of shooting modes and filters.\n\n\\- fast shutter speed (she's a toddler, it's hard to get a picture where she's not moving.)\n\n\\- physical view finder (this one is the lowest priority, because my wife doesn't care at all about that, but i kind of want it.)\n\nwe'd like to keep the price under $300 cdn, but there's some flexibility if it's a really good deal or a camera with a must-have feature/function.\n\nthanks for any advice you can give! and if i'm expecting too much camera for too little money, feel free to tell me to go stuff myself. at least i'll know to lower my expectations.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 77068, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "1096bimu", "date": "2019-05-16 18:23:55", "content": "Expensive versus cheap filter ROUND II /!/ Last time some snobs came up with a bunch of excuses so now I've fixed all of them, I'm testing exactly the kinds of things the snobs wanted.\n\nHere is B+W CPL filter, I think it's $100+, versus $15 Neewer CPL filter, cheapest on Amazon.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/hrQ07XY](https://imgur.com/a/hrQ07XY)\n\nI got it all covered this time, we have a hug reflection on the table, which is cut by the filter, so snobs can please tell me how the expensive filter is cutting that reflection better, cuz I don't see any difference.\n\nWe also got the same white balance issue, I'm again using the same white balance where but one of them is clearly way more blue while the other is mostly neutral.\n\nWe also have flare test, even on the first set of images the bright widow is just outside of frame so you can tell me which one has more contrast.
