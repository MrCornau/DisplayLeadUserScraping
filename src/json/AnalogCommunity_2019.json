New to the subreddit. Kinda new to reddit in general. I have a couple of questions that are kinda long!\n\n**QUESTION 1: CURSED EKTACHROME?**\n\nI've been developing and scanning my own film for about two and a half months now, started off with C-41 and moved onto E-6 about a month ago. Fell in love with slides, but they were too expensive...swallowed the cost of a few rolls of 35mm Provia, Velvia 50, and Ektachrome until I found a source of some expired 120mm Ektachrome 100 from 2006. Figured this was a good excuse to get into medium format while I was at it. \n\nI shot the 35mm stuff with an XD11. Eager to try out the medium format film, but without an actual camera yet (I had actually bought the film and shipped it to my friend so we could use his Mamiya 645 while I visited, but this didn't work out) I decided to test a roll out on a......Holga 120N. I know...but I thought, expired film, toy camera, how appropriate.\n\nI had successfully developed one roll of Provia off of one set of [these chemicals](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1362747-REG/freestyle_photographic_11861_arista_rapid_e_6_slide.html), then after letting them sit in the bottles for too long before developing another roll (I got busy with finals), I decided to throw out the bottles to avoid ruining my pictures. So, with fresh chemicals, I developed five rolls of film. I have a two-roll Patterson hand tank. I developed them as follows:\n\n* Two rolls of Provia. These came out absolutely fine.\n* A roll of Velvia 50 and Ektachrome. These came out with contrasting casts (the Velvia was slightly magenta and the Ektachrome was greenish. Weird.)\n* A roll of the Ektachrome in question, which came out like...\n\n![video](kzglw75ulb431 \"Was expecting wonky images. Was not expecting this.\")\n\nSo obviously, I figured that the Holga, being leakier than the Titanic, just completely let the film go blank. That or I overexposed the film, but seeing as I rated it at ISO 38 and shot on a partly cloudy day, this seems unlikely (if anything, I underexposed it).\n\nI decided that if I wanted to shoot medium format, I'd want to do it right. So I picked up a Fuji(ca) GW690(I) from eBay (in Exc+++ condition) last week. Shot it yesterday. With the Ektachrome. Rated it at ISO 38. Thought to myself, *Good! Let's see how this goes!*\n\nI don't have a picture of how it turned out because I immediately thew it away in anger. It came out the same as from the Holga.\n\nI thought that exposure to light after taking the roll out of the camera might have done something, but with the roll that came from the GW690 I literally took it from the camera to the changing bag I use to load film into the tank like...basically immediately. My friend thought it was something with the developer or errors in my process, but I keep a good eye on temperature, I don't mix up bottles of solution, I wash well between steps...etc. \n\nI'm gonna shoot a roll of Provia today to see if it's just the stock itself being iffy, but how likely is that? Are there any glaring errors in what I've done that'd lead to this? I bought the offending rolls from [here](https://www.filmwholesale.com/), and these folks have yet to let me down (in fact, their expired rolls of Fujicolor 100 from 2010 and their rolls of Supra 400 from ??? (I'm guessing 2003) have worked out incredibly well for me in the past).\n\n**QUESTION 2: E6 AGITATION PATTERNS?**\n\nLike I said above, I use [this kit](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1362747-REG/freestyle_photographic_11861_arista_rapid_e_6_slide.html) to develop at home. The thing is, the instructions for agitation in this kit, unlike its C-41 counterpart, are kinda confusing, and I dunno, I might be dumb, but I don't exactly know how to interpret this:\n\n&gt;Agitation is critical for properly developed film. Keep your agitation consistent...Except for the wash steps use the following agitation procedure for all the steps: After adding the chemicals to the tank and tapping, agitate by inverting the tank to the left then right and twisting left and right *vigorously* for the first 15 seconds of the processing. Then repeat the agitation technique once every 30 seconds.\n\nSo far, I've taken this to mean 15 seconds of just going ballistic and letting your tank have it every 30 seconds, but I don't quite know how to space it. I've tried finding videos of people doing it, but since everyone speeds it up, or uses a different set of chemicals which only makes use of the spinny rod, I've decided to ask actual people. I made two charts:\n\n![img](rpd5ubeurb431 \"Figure one?\")\n\n![img](u5dxorcosb431 \"Figure two?\")\n\nGreen is time spent shaking the hell out of the tank, the numbers represent when on the stopwatch an agitation starts, the red indicates stop time (and the multiple stop times on the first developer represent extension to compensate for chemical exhaustion).\n\nLike both work, but I'm afraid pattern one has been overdoing it, but pattern two might be introducing my color shifts (and also blanking out old Ektachrome??? Maybe????)\n\n**TL;DR:** Bought some [120mm Ektachrome 100](https://www.filmwholesale.com/products/kodak-epp-120-film-slide-wholesale) from 2006 which came out clear after souping it myself, despite previous successful attempts on other film stocks, after shooting it from both a Holga 120N AND a Fuji GW690.

Before I crack into it I want to ask some questions to make sure I have everything straight\n\nThe developer I purchased is called r09 spezial and comes in a 120ml bottle with recommendations to dilute 1:15. For my film (Ilford hp5) the packaging says I should develop for 4 minutes so I was going to aim for that. The fixer I have is Ilford rapid fixer. For the stop bath I was just going to use water. My house is currently 15C degrees instead of the 20C degrees the chemicals ask for so I was going to try and do a water bath for all the chemicals.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1) 1:15 dilution is awkward to work out in my head but I think that means I add in 66.666ml and then top that up to 1L total with water. The bottle itself is 120ml so I was going to aim for about half the bottle. Is this right?\n\n2) when I pour out my developer how much water do I use for a stop bath and how much should I agitate? \nI was going to fill it up once, agitate it for 10-15seconds, pour out the water and rinse the tank one or two more times whilst agitating lightly. Does this sound about right? \n\n3) how long do I fix for? The bottle recommends 2-5minutes but that's a huge variance and I don't know enough to know when to opt for 2mins Vs 5mins. I was going to split the difference and aim for 3.5mins, does this sound reasonable?\n\n4) both the developer and fixing agent can be reused at a later time right? So when I finish each step I should pour them back into their containers not down the drain.\n\n5) if I mess up can the images be recovered? I have two rolls of hp5 which I was going to do at the same time but I recognise there's a decent chance I'll mess this up since it's my first time and I'd rather not lose both sets of images. Would you recommend doing one roll as a test or should I just do both? \n\n6) Should I lengthen my times to account for the cold environment even if I use a water bath? (My thinking is the cold environment might cool down the chemicals after they've been added to the tank since the tank won't be in the water bath)\n\n7) can I use the same funnel for everything provided I rinse it between uses? \n\n8)when I'm loading the film onto the qspools can I touch it with my fingers or will that leave large smudges on the film? l accidentally smudged some negatives on the first roll I shot but I'm not sure if it only becomes sensitive like this after its developed or not.

Wall of text incoming :)\n\n# Scanner &amp; Scanning Software\n\nBoth Examples are scanned with a dedicated film scanner, the Minolta Multi Pro.

I think Silverfast is also capable of doing this for certain models but not my Minolta.\n\nBut in the past I also used an Epson 4990 which also worked pretty good. It only had aligning issues at times from the image to the IR scan, because it scans them in separate passes and the film might bulge in between due to the heat of the lamp.\n\n# Flat Field Correction\n\nOften this is done from scanner software directly and called \"calibrate scanner\" to even out the ccd sensor response and of the light source. But I had issues with the internal scanner software calibration from Vuescan that caused colored 1 pixel lines and other unusual shadows/color shades.  So I decided that this must be done manually on the raw scan to fix the issues.\n\nI used a technique that astro photographers are using to correct their photos that are often plagued with noise and other optical shades. You can read up details and the math behind it at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-field_correction). \n\nHere is a excerpt from my scanning working doc:\n\n\\------------------\n\n**! Important** \n\nSetup your crop area for your all your scans and leave it unchanged! Otherwise the calibration will not work as it should be.\n\n**Dark Frame (Fixed Pattern Noise = FPN)**\n\nUsed to correct the dark current noise and uneven response of the CCD pixels to remove stripes in the scans.\n\n* Scan frame with holder opening closed with same exposure and samples as the image that is about to be  scanned\n* Check the dark frame for light leaks. It should be flat without any brighter parts.\n* Resize image to a 1 pixel strip (along line sensor axis)  to get a footprint of the line sensor response. The resize to 1 pixel will interpolated (bicubic) so that the average is used later on.\n* Place the dark frame on the base image and resize it back to the size of the base image.\n* Subtract dark frame from base image\n\n**Flat Field (FF)**\n\nUsed to eliminate uneven illumination of the lamp and to correct dirt on the mirrors and sensor.\n\n* Set the exposure as high as possible without any clipping!\n* Dark frame is subtracted from the flat field\n* That flat-field 'image' is normalized by dividing the entire image by the brightest pixels of the FF image.\n* Divide base image with the flat field image.\n* Note: the IR channel must be flatfielded as well\n\n# IR Clean\n\nThe cleaning of the scan is done with the help of the IR scan (infra red) of the film. Infrared is capable to show defects as dark spots that help to mask them properly.\n\nHere is a excerpt from my scanning working doc:\n\n\\------------------ \n\n* Reduce visible image parts from the Infrared image by dividing it with the Red channel of the image.

Sadly It makes no sense to share them as it is specialized for my scanner and workflow. :(  But hopefully the results and the explanation provided will help to make something out it for yourself.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/dsprgb/the_magic_of_ir_cleaning_and_flatfield_correction/"}, {"autor": "Sesaero", "selftext": "The last two rolls of film I developed came back with a handful of light leaks.
