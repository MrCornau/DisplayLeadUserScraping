At lower ISO the M10 files are cleaner for noise. But for resolution and at higher ISO the M10-R is better. If you consistently make large prints, consider the M10-R, if not, the M10 works just fine. If you want a excellent review comparison for the M10 and M10-R cameras, I recommend you subscribe to Reid Reviews and you can make an informed decision vs taking my word for it. Both cameras are superb, I create very large prints for my clients and therefore need the M10-R. Before that, the M10-P worked almost as well for me.

It should stay OUT (the roller almost sticking out of the camera front), under pressure from an internal camera spring. The spring is what forces the roller to maintain contact with the lens' moving focus cam. In theory, that spring itself can fail - but gummed-up lubricants in the mechanism are far, far more likely to cause a jam or sticking than a broken spring. ****Uh-oh!**** In examining my own M10 to confirm exactly how the lever works - I just noticed that the tip of the RF arm is catching or rubbing intermittently on the lens mount ring as the spring forces it forward. The screw and brass washer on the top of the roller-cam axle (above the arm itself) just barely clear the mount even when normal, but mine has/had even less clearance. --img--  Mostly it is just a brief contact that the spring overrides, but a couple of times it stuck hard for a moment (this would also cause the RF image to stop moving part-way through the normal range). I cleared this problem by applying a little downward pressure on the arm with a tiny screw-driver tip - but I don't recommend that as a procedure. There comes a point where uninformed or sloppy DIY work on the Leica RF just becomes a can of tangled worms that only Leica can untangle. I just happen to be a lucky risk-taker.

I don't recall if I wrote the following in this thread or another one: in the old Photo Net Leica forum, people often wrote that a 35mm Tri-X image should not, or could not, be printed larger than 8x10 or 11x14 \u2014 that you should shoot medium format if you wanted larger prints. Then, in 2006, I saw the Daido Moriyama retrospective exhibition at the Gallery of New South Wales: 150x100 cm (60 x 40 inch) prints from 35mm Tri-X negatives: printed on an wide format inkjet printer, they were stunning. That is to say, I prefer the 35 mm aesthetic and don't want greater resolution that my M10 provides. I also prefer to have 24 MB rather than 40 MB files, so that I don't have to shoot at higher shutter speeds to keep definition. As for the M10R having greater dynamic range than the M10, some people feel that the M10 has slightly more dynamic range, as shown in the graphs on the photonstophotos.net charts, especially the Photographic Dynamic Range Shadow Improvement Charts. ____________________Frog Leaping photobook You could not have said it better, and I feel the same way than you right now. I really hesitated for a few days to upgrade, and this was my reasoning: Pros: -The R will hold value better for when its time trade it in for the M11. -The extra resolution -The slightly better DR and IQ as reported by early adopters My biggest hesitation, as I stated on multiple occasion, was that the image would be too sharp, too digital, too clinical, and that it would not please me as much as my beloved M10P. This is why you comment resonates with me a lot. I prefer the 35mm 24MP look. I know how to work with it, and I know I already like it. With the 10R, I take a risk to like it less. On top of that, I saw some shots on that popular Instagram photographer Andre Josselin today (its on his stories, so hurry up if you want to see as well before its gone). He recently got his hands on the M10R. His first posts with it today, if you omit the flare created by his Voigtlander 35mm Nokton, look like they were taken on an A7RIV. The DR is too perfect, the image is too sharp, there are so many details ! some may like it, but I much preferred his M10/M240 previous work. So it helped me made my mind. Regarding the value, sure, the 10R will sell better than the 10P in 2 years, but that didn't take into account the money I will lose upfront in the P to R upgrade lol! So for now, here's my setup: M10P for my \"authenticity\" needs - Q2 for my thirst of MP, but at least I get autofocus, a beautiful lens, and Macro mode with it for a maximum of versatility - A7SIII for video What else can a man ask for ?

To sum it up: The M10-R is a M10-P that looks like a M10 with a fantastic new sensor: Higher resolution, so that You can make heavy crops easily. Higher dynamic range (nearly 1 f-stop, I would guess) for good highlights. And better colors. Noise is very good, better than with the M10: More detail, beautiful fine grain. High ISO is also slightly better than with the M10. Very good usable up to 6400 ISO; 12500 ISO is still good usable. Above that there is too much color shift and details are lost. The rangefinder is the same as in the M10/M10-M. No problems with focussing at this resolution. The camera was perfectly calibrated with my Apo-Summicron 2,0/50 mm. I had no problems focussing in practice too. And I never noticed anything negative due to the higher resolution of the sensor: Not more blur, no need for higher shutter speed to avoid blur, no problems with sharpness. AWB was a bit cooler than with the M10. No problem for me, I like it. But Leica said to us they want to make it alike the other cameras of the M-line. This was one result of our firmware betatest. General usability is as good as the M10. Same silent shutter and touchscreen, only a little bit slower in saving pictures due to the bigger data volume. But that doesn\u00b4t matter to me. Firmware stability is good, no freezing. The M10 in all it\u00b4s variants is the best usual M-camera - but: Wake up time is far too long!!!! 1,5 sec!!! And the timelag when shooting in LV mode is too long too. Does one need the higher resolution: It is an advantage, no doubt. I made a few comparisons with the the M10. You can see the difference, but it is not eye-catching, You have to look close at cropped photos. Then You see that the ones oft he M10-R are sharper and have more crisp. For many this may be a strong reason to buy this camera. For me it is more the higher dynamic range and the better color.

However, money is not unlimited, so I still have some choices to make, which I'm hoping some of you can help with, or at least confirm that they might not be as tough as they appear. My current thinking is that I can get a good used M10 (\u00a34100) and 35mm Summilux ASPH II (\u00a32300). I'm mostly going to be using this for travel and street style, so I think that this seems like a good combination. Photography isn't my profession, or even a money-making sideline, it's just for my own enjoyment. And yes, I fully realise that there are many cheaper, newer, 'better' cameras out there. I don't want one of those. But then, the internet hinders as much as it helps. Should I spend another \u00a31000 for the M10-P? The touch screen looks nice but isn't a big issue for me, and the quieter shutter is, well, nice? I don't see hundreds of threads of people complaining about the outrageously loud shutter on the M10, so is it really worth it for me? And it will take me another few months to save the extra cash. Then there's the M10-R, obviously, but at least another \u00a33000 on top of my M10 budget. And an even longer time to save. Ideally I could add in some actual real world experiences to my decision making. However here in the UK it doesn't seem possible to hire any of these cameras so I can't try them out to see which I prefer, and I don't know anyone with one either. I find it very easy to get caught up in the details, just because there's something newer, 'better', whatever. So maybe my question is this; is the M10 still a good value introduction to the Leica world? Thoughts, ideas, and help all appreciated. Yes I think so. Anyway, for me the gateway to Leica World in the nineties has been secondhand gear and it has been for a long time after. I then even preferred an M4 above a new M6. In your case however I personally would definitely choose for the M10-P. The silence of its shutter is such a joy in actual shooting, which would be my main reason. But in theatre photography, which I like, it is an important functionality too. The built-in level gauge would help me making good vertical shots and with a 35mm, or wider later on, this is an important aid. As I get older I see that I make much more often tilted shots. The touchscreen is faster in checking focus. Your argument for the choice for the Summilux 35mm asph ii is bull\u2019s eye in my view.

Absolutely you'll prefer one to the others. But it isn't resolution. Change cameras and you change the type of *film*stock you're using.

This is time, instead of using my Sumilux 35 ASPH pre FLE, I decided to go with the Nokton 35 1.4 MC vII. I chose this lens because it has a more vintage classic look, IMO, and I wanted to see if we could lose that character with a very modern camera like the Sony if it would render as nicely. All photos where shot in raw, about 20 secs apart from each other. They are not always exactly the same cause I did it handheld. I wish I had more people, and in general more interesting stuff but France just got under lock down again so I had to do it all at home. My kids and my dog move too fast for lens change, and my wife has stopped accepting to be the subject of these camera tests long ago. The photos are all very very boring, but the point of this test was just to compare the cameras in different scenarios. A note on shooting with both camera: On the M10P , it was actually easier to focus with the RF than with the Focus peaking on the Sony, even if the Sony is nice. The metering on the A7SIII outperforms the M10P almost every time, even though I used the M10P in live mode to avoid spot metering. I did the blind test to myself, and to be honest I could not always guess which camera was which. But almost every time I shocked myself and preferred the Sony to the Leica. Of course, shooting wise, the Sony was still disgusting, and the Leica was a total pleasure. But what I remember from this is that 12MP vs 24MP produces no aesthetics difference (since this is what this thread is about). Besides that, of course I prefer my Leica, but if one day I go out to shoot video with my Sony, I know that I could bring my 35 mil with me and still get photos as well. Let me know if you have any interrogation on the way I took the photos, settings, etc.... Now my question to you is not which camera is Sony and which is Leica, but which one did you prefer ? https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31?usp=sharing Your pictures have produced some advanced thoughts. The setting is world class beautiful. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31 TECHNICAL COMMENT ON THE TEST: For each two pictures, one picture is usually more sharp than the other. Can not say which I like best. The sharper picture had more of a \"still life\" feel to it. The less sharp more of an atmospheric feel. Which I liked more depended on subject matter. I can not say that I saw the M10 24 meg smoothness verses the M10-R 40 meg light harshness though yet another version of this effect is illustrated in your pictures. Overall I liked the sharper one better because it catches that \"still life\" aesthetic. Yet the sharpness was somewhat of a smooth-sharpness, not with a irritating harsh edge, maybe due to lens choice. Increasingly I see this as important, that if the sensor has the highest level of megabytes, it will be \"sharp\" but it might also produce a pixelation type digital-harsh-edge harshness that is not exactly seen but felt, since that edge harshness is only slightly there out at the highest levels of resolution. The paragraph immediately above is the only explanation I can give for the M10's pictures being more satisfying (somehow less harsh) than the M10-R's. Yet with software the M10-R's rendition might be smoothable to end this lightly irritating harshness and thus create the best still life's (see below Art Comment). So overall I would say that if a person is good with post production software the M10-R might be the better choice. Yet I dislike spending hours in post and prefer the adjustment be selectable in the camera. HIGHER MEG SENSOR HARSHNESS: In the interest of the intellectual study of the arts I will venture an explanation which might be torn down latter. Some will say this 40 meg harshness is just a matter of contrast technically but I would go further and say that it might be the sharp 40 line pairs (80 lines) MTF test-lines of the lens interacting with the inherent digital pixelation harshness of small pixel (40 meg based) digital sensor capture. Thus the 24 meg digital with big pixels and less resolution can not produce this harshness at the higher resolution 80 line mtf test point but the 40 meg can see this fine edge making it rough/harsh where the 24meg sensor misses this fine detail. If the camera software does not soften up this new increased detail a bit then you get a sort of micro edge harshness that 24 meg could not produce. Through your choice (not a mistake) of a less sharp and artistically rendering lens (Voitlander Nokton 35mm1.4), the lens helps make the picture work, softening the digital harshness effect. With a sharper Leica lens directing light to a sharper Leica 40 meg sensor, a harshness might be produced which irritates as seen by we ultra sensitive viewers, and as found in the previous M10 24meg vs M10-R 40meg pictures by we ultra-sensitives (not trolls). As in Formula One racing\u2026 the most moneyed race engineers hit the limits of the physics first and see problematic phenomena that create problems to be dealt with. Less moneyed race teams working with known technology do not see these problems. Thus the M10-R 40 meg plus the sharpest of Leica lenses may be producing this harsh line edge which makes M10's softer edge line edge more desirable. Fix it in post as they say (if that is fully possible). The M10 is definitely a standout camera in the history of digital cameras in both how it treats sharpness and color saturation. ART COMMENT: One of the many explanations for the \"still life\" effect is: as the eye looks around it sees something that looks real because of an extremely high level of detail, yet your mind also knows that \"it is not real it is a picture\". This dichotomy is intriguing, to vacillate between the emotional-mental sensation of real and unreal. Again, by using smallest F-stops and high meg sensors and sharpest lenses, placing the ultra high resolution in various places around the scene where the eye would not normally see so much detail, signals the mind that something otherworldly is going on. Again, the emotion is one of \"this is real but it is not real\" which is otherworldly giving an accompanying intrigue. So in Still Life you have at least two intrigues: 1- Picture representation verses reality and 2- The beyond human focus detail verses what your eye-mind is normally encountering in the real world. In the USA some call this aesthetic \"American Realism\" as the ultra high detail of a painter's Still Life \"table top subject\" is applied to \"a scene much larger than a table top\". In the picture your eye sees more detail than it would ever see in real life. All around the frame picture elements \"pop\" into life as their detail is noticed. BACK TO CAMERAS: The ability of the 40 meg sensor to create this Still Life ultra sharpness effect, means I would favor the sharper higher meg picture if the harshness can be lessoned by some de-sharpening. Also maybe software can soften the 40 meg picture down to the more atmospheric softer focus effect of the 24 meg? Fixing in post production software to me frequently creates a picture that looks way too extreme, artificial, and childish like advertising shock techniques so I would rather the camera produce a satisfying rendition in a more eye-natural manner. I do not want to spend hours playing with software sliders that mainly result in an unrealistic looking \"mechanical\" picture. Do I have the time or interest in trying to make the two cameras match one another in post... probably not. I will leave this for people like the great Overgaard. Still can he make one camera perform like two cameras... it is too much to ask. If not or with a little changing of the picture in post... two cameras sit out there on the market with unique and justifiable existences. The artsy 24 meg soft sharpness camera M10 and the 40 meg M10-R with an edge hardness that can likely be lessoned in software to produce a fascinating Still Life ultra high resolution rendition. One website I read comments that the M10-R's 40 megs helps see the original rendition of older Leica lenses (Steve Huff's site). To me this is a holy grail for camera bodies - to bring out the old Leica lens characteristics. I find it odd that people want their lenses \"corrected\" by software. Clearly they have missed the concept of \"art\" as a \"partially real and part modified\" representation of reality. IF I MADE DECISIONS FOR THE LEICA COMPANY: I would NOT only let the time and attention of the marketplace decide the popularity of my camera and aesthetic. I would also produce download instructions for manually entered adjustments for the different aesthetics and also produce template files where possible. Why let 3rd parties decide your economic survival? Why leave the user in the dark without the knowledge to fully use the camera? Yet best would be a checkbox in the camera's menu software that would produce the 24meg softer aesthetic or the 40 meg sharper still life aesthetic.

Again, by using smallest F-stops and high meg sensors and sharpest lenses, placing the ultra high resolution in various places around the scene where the eye would not normally see so much detail, signals the mind that something otherworldly is going on. Again, the emotion is one of \"this is real but it is not real\" which is otherworldly giving an accompanying intrigue. So in Still Life you have at least two intrigues: 1- Picture representation verses reality and 2- The beyond human focus detail verses what your eye-mind is normally encountering in the real world. In the USA some call this aesthetic \"American Realism\" as the ultra high detail of a painter's Still Life \"table top subject\" is applied to \"a scene much larger than a table top\". In the picture your eye sees more detail than it would ever see in real life. All around the frame picture elements \"pop\" into life as their detail is noticed. BACK TO CAMERAS: The ability of the 40 meg sensor to create this Still Life ultra sharpness effect, means I would favor the sharper higher meg picture if the harshness can be lessoned by some de-sharpening. Also maybe software can soften the 40 meg picture down to the more atmospheric softer focus effect of the 24 meg? Fixing in post production software to me frequently creates a picture that looks way too extreme, artificial, and childish like advertising shock techniques so I would rather the camera produce a satisfying rendition in a more eye-natural manner. I do not want to spend hours playing with software sliders that mainly result in an unrealistic looking \"mechanical\" picture. Do I have the time or interest in trying to make the two cameras match one another in post... probably not. I will leave this for people like the great Overgaard. Still can he make one camera perform like two cameras... it is too much to ask. If not or with a little changing of the picture in post... two cameras sit out there on the market with unique and justifiable existences. The artsy 24 meg soft sharpness camera M10 and the 40 meg M10-R with an edge hardness that can likely be lessoned in software to produce a fascinating Still Life ultra high resolution rendition. One website I read comments that the M10-R's 40 megs helps see the original rendition of older Leica lenses (Steve Huff's site). To me this is a holy grail for camera bodies - to bring out the old Leica lens characteristics. I find it odd that people want their lenses \"corrected\" by software. Clearly they have missed the concept of \"art\" as a \"partially real and part modified\" representation of reality. IF I MADE DECISIONS FOR THE LEICA COMPANY: I would NOT only let the time and attention of the marketplace decide the popularity of my camera and aesthetic. I would also produce download instructions for manually entered adjustments for the different aesthetics and also produce template files where possible. Why let 3rd parties decide your economic survival? Why leave the user in the dark without the knowledge to fully use the camera? Yet best would be a checkbox in the camera's menu software that would produce the 24meg softer aesthetic or the 40 meg sharper still life aesthetic. Thanks for the picture test Steve... you got me thinking. Brilliant post Tom. I enjoyed reading through it very much, and a lot of your points have left me thinking. But before I can make my mind too, I must ask you something. You mention that one series of the photos I took in the test looks sharper, more still life. Could you tell me if it\u2019s series A or series B? I want to see if your feel is based on actual MP count, or if other factors could have influenced it, for example maybe better DR of the M10R/A7S3 sensors ..... in any case, some people said before they this thread was useless. Your post proved it isn\u2019t. At least not for everyone, not for me... I enjoy this conversation. cheers", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/314500-24meg-verses-40meg-aesthetic/page/9/?tab=comments#comment-4070696", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin":

advanced thoughts. the setting is world class beautiful. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wclybcwqb_i2nw6dhf8-4vhfutxcpf31 technical comment on the test: for each two pictures, one picture is usually more sharp than the other. can not say which i like best. the sharper picture had more of a \"still life\" feel to it. the less sharp more of an atmospheric feel. which i liked more depended on subject matter. i can not say that i saw the m10 24 meg smoothness verses the m10-r 40 meg light harshness though yet another version of this effect is illustrated in your pictures. overall i liked the sharper one better because it catches that \"still life\" aesthetic. yet the sharpness was somewhat of a smooth-sharpness, not with a irritating harsh edge, maybe due to lens choice. increasingly i see this as important, that if the sensor has the highest level of megabytes, it will be \"sharp\" but it might also produce a pixelation type digital-harsh-edge harshness that is not exactly seen but felt, since that edge harshness is only slightly there out at the highest levels of resolution. the paragraph immediately above is the only explanation i can give for the m10's pictures being more satisfying (somehow less harsh) than the m10-r's. yet with software the m10-r's rendition might be smoothable to end this lightly irritating harshness and thus create the best still life's (see below art comment). so overall i would say that if a person is good with post production software the m10-r might be the better choice. yet i dislike spending hours in post and prefer the adjustment be selectable in the camera. higher meg sensor harshness: in the interest of the intellectual study of the arts i will venture an explanation which might be torn down latter. some will say this 40 meg harshness is just a matter of contrast technically but i would go further and say that it might be the sharp 40 line pairs (80 lines) mtf test-lines of the lens interacting with the inherent digital pixelation harshness of small pixel (40 meg based) digital sensor capture. thus the 24 meg digital with big pixels and less resolution can not produce this harshness at the higher resolution 80 line mtf test point but the 40 meg can see this fine edge making it rough/harsh where the 24meg sensor misses this fine detail. if the camera software does not soften up this new increased detail a bit then you get a sort of micro edge harshness that 24 meg could not produce. through your choice (not a mistake) of a less sharp and artistically rendering lens (voitlander nokton 35mm1.4), the lens helps make the picture work, softening the digital harshness effect. with a sharper leica lens directing light to a sharper leica 40 meg sensor, a harshness might be produced which irritates as seen by we ultra sensitive viewers, and as found in the previous m10 24meg vs m10-r 40meg pictures by we ultra-sensitives (not trolls). as in formula one racing\u2026 the most moneyed race engineers hit the limits of the physics first and see problematic phenomena that create problems to be dealt with. less moneyed race teams working with known technology do not see these problems. thus the m10-r 40 meg plus the sharpest of leica lenses may be producing this harsh line edge which makes m10's softer edge line edge more desirable. fix it in post as they say (if that is fully possible). the m10 is definitely a standout camera in the history of digital cameras in both how it treats sharpness and color saturation. art comment: one of the many explanations for the \"still life\" effect is: as the

"content": "14 hours ago, Steven said: Following up to the request of @Raymondl, and to satisfy myself as well, I continued my unscientific, real life comparison of the Sony A7SIII\u2019s 12MP sensor, and the 24MP sensor from the M10P. This is time, instead of using my Sumilux 35 ASPH pre FLE, I decided to go with the Nokton 35 1.4 MC vII. I chose this lens because it has a more vintage classic look, IMO, and I wanted to see if we could lose that character with a very modern camera like the Sony if it would render as nicely. All photos where shot in raw, about 20 secs apart from each other. They are not always exactly the same cause I did it handheld. I wish I had more people, and in general more interesting stuff but France just got under lock down again so I had to do it all at home. My kids and my dog move too fast for lens change, and my wife has stopped accepting to be the subject of these camera tests long ago. The photos are all very very boring, but the point of this test was just to compare the cameras in different scenarios. A note on shooting with both camera: On the M10P , it was actually easier to focus with the RF than with the Focus peaking on the Sony, even if the Sony is nice. The metering on the A7SIII outperforms the M10P almost every time, even though I used the M10P in live mode to avoid spot metering. I did the blind test to myself, and to be honest I could not always guess which camera was which. But almost every time I shocked myself and preferred the Sony to the Leica. Of course, shooting wise, the Sony was still disgusting, and the Leica was a total pleasure. But what I remember from this is that 12MP vs 24MP produces no aesthetics difference (since this is what this thread is about). Besides that, of course I prefer my Leica, but if one day I go out to shoot video with my Sony, I know that I could bring my 35 mil with me and still get photos as well. Let me know if you have any interrogation on the way I took the photos, settings, etc.... Now my question to you is not which camera is Sony and which is Leica, but which one did you prefer ? https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31?usp=sharing Hey @Steven thanks for spending time and putting this togetheir I have gone through the images and here are my thoughts. Image #1: B -Rationale: I prefer softer transition look towards the right corner Image #2: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal. Besides the warmer colours from the top LHS, I am assuming the sun position had changed. Image #3: A -Rationale: I preferred the \u201chue\u201d of the green grass behind the soft toy Image #4: B -Rationale: I really didn\u2019t like image A corners. it looked like it had shade of \u201cpink\u201d Image #5: A -Rationale: Although I didn\u2019t like the colours on the corners, I actually preferred the highlights \u201cclipping\u201d in this image. Image B is technically better (highlights don\u2019t look clipped\u2026 has a more gently roll off) but my preference is still A Image #6: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #7: B -Rationale: I prefer the colours from the ocean \u2013 Sky compared to A -Additional Notes: Looking at the grass I can see what sections of the frame is in focus, so I won\u2019t focus on the dog and ball. Image #8: N/A -Rationale: I had a slight preference to A due to the skin tones, but it\u2019s difficult for me to make an assessment here, as the focus is slightly different. -Additional Notes: note that the image on A is focused on the eye, whilst B is slightly off Image #9: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #10: B -Rationale: The tiles had more detail on B than A (Corners) Image #11: B -Rationale: I prefer the warmer look in (B) than the colder look in (A) Image #12: B -Rationale: Prefer how the tree looks (shadow) compared to A. Additionally I like how the wall on the RHS look the \u201ccooler\u201d colour cast looks better compared to the slightly warmer tones. Image #13: A -Rationale: I prefer the warmer colours here (green, sky) Image #14: A -Rationale: I prefer the warmer colours here -Additional Notes: focus is slightly different (refer to the tap) Image #15: B -Rationale: Prefer the light on the grass in this scene, very close though.

Not the point of any of my posts. I posted that first grouping as a reaction to several comments complaining that M10-R files are flat. Hence a selection of high contrast poppy sort of shots. Not what you're looking for. Check. But thinking a few photos from a singular photographer represent what the M10-R is all about is not giving Leica much credit, methinks. Having shot with the M10 for 3.5 years, I see the 10-R as a more flexible tool, particularly for color work. AFAIC, there is a set of lenses that have never, ever looked better, far smoother in transition to OoF areas, for example. With no reasonable T/S solution for the M, I place value on the increased ability to crop vertically, yet still be able to print with nearly the same number of pixels as if I had clambered up a ladder with the original. There are a host of other reasons some, no doubt, as yet undiscovered. AFAIC, I've yet to encounter anything the M10 could do, the 10-R can not. This isn't to say their aren't noticeable differences SooC. There are. It's a matter of recalibrating how you go about treating the files to drag out what you happen to want. This remains an ongoing process for me at the moment. My tendency so far has been to try to explore and exploit the new capabilities, rather than the familiar ones. After 6 or 7 years of 24Mpx Leicas, I am (and I suspect others as well) looking for a different look. Over time perhaps some will re-embrace the more classical look, older glass will return into the rotation and as it does, you may begin to see work that alters your view a bit. But, as thats not what I'm interested in the moment, I have very little in the portfolio to convince you one way or the other. But let's quickly try. This time two images taken roughly two years and 100 miles apart. Chosen for no particular reason other than they share a similar motif coupled with the fact that my current catalog of B&W photos done with the R is limited at present. One with the 50mm 'lux, the other the 35mm Distagon. One with the M10, one with the M10R. Forget about whether or not you find the resultant style compelling, not the point. The point is that if I so desire I can make the same sort of photos from a tonality standpoint with the R as I did with the previous version. Yet again the resampling and downsizing does a measure of injustice to the originals in either case, but hopefully the pair convey some sense that these cameras are indeed siblings. The younger one, should you so choose to take advantage, being capable of a bit more 'tude. But if she oversteps, you can still send her straight to her room to contemplate the indiscretion. --img--  --img--  Where I value having the added flexibility of the 10R, you might find no need for it. That, however, is an entirely different discussion. If you hate detail and are constantly having to tamp it down, the case for the R, or any higher resolution camera, certainly takes a hit. But as always, the power to use or abuse rests within the mind of the photographer. I recall my initial reaction to all the early M10M/50APO shots was wow, astonishing, not even remotely for me. Then I saw a few efforts elsewhere, using different glass and post treatments and decided that if I ever sell my beloved race car, I'm gonna get me one of 'em. Perhaps, if examined dispassionately, you might find as I did with the M10M that there are a few subtle aspects buried in one or two of the very limited set of samples available that might be relevant to what you want to achieve.

Can you get back to the 24 meg aesthetic? Can you pull the 24 meg aesthetic out of the 40 meg file? I bet you can but\u2026 it looks too technical as the software massages the file with some downsampling or de-sharpening or whatever system is used. Usually with software the randomness of the original is lost as a fixed systematic program is applied to the pixels. But maybe it satisfies? At this point I vacillate. Like you I am considering M10-R, but I only own M9 and M8.2 so have no M10 to compare, and no camera store within even 3 hours drive to test a new Leica body. And I add Z6 Nikon that has all things maybe but same problem of a Z7 with much higher resolution to confuse the choice. Love that line of yours\u2026 \"Marry the camera lens\u2026 date the camera body\". I don't know man... I'm frustrated at this point. I want so badly to buy the M10R. I like having the latest thing. I like flexibility. I like the red dot design ! I really want to love it. The extra MP would be useful for me because as you can see on my instagram I do a lot of landscape, and compositing as well so sometimes I take one small piece of a photo and put it in another, so detail matters. But I also use my M a lot on \"people\", and for people I think I just don't like it as much as my M10P, regardless of the lens. I just downloaded all the photos from DP review and Matt and played with them all night. On the positive side, I need to say that I am pleasantly surprised. I could never manage to edit and like my R5 or my A7RIV photos. Never. I always blamed it on the MP. But I always loved my Q2 high res clinical images. And here again with the M10R files, the images are very beautiful. But on the negative side, they are just too clean, too modern, too detailed too perfect. I am sorry, but this has proven to me 100% that 40MP has a different aesthetics, and no matter what I did, I could not make them look \"atmospheric\" in LR... It's frustrating because at this point I believe that for street and landscape, the M10R is clearly superior, but for people and portraits, in my taste, the M10P is more advantageous. I just couldn't make them match perfectly. I think that if you plan to upgrade from an M9, spending the premium on the M10R is logical.

This seems to me to notice this even now in the digital photos taken with sensors with more mega. The problem, which also existed with the slides when they had to be printed, is that we have a long bar which must then end up in a small box, so the bar has to be compressed or cut. This comes from from a dynamic range greater than its destination. The real scene has a very wide range, the sensor that collects it much smaller, the monitor a little more and finally the print the smaller. This also seems to me the reason why the 10R files look flatter as soon as they come out and need to be \u201ccompressed\u201d more to get a good contrast. What I ask myself is whether, thinking mainly of the \"box\" inside which the image must end, a certain amount of megapixels is more harmonious and suitable for entering more easily. What do you think ? (This reasoning only on aesthetics and not on the other advantages with more mega) BASIC FILE QUALITY OR DIGITAL ADJUSTMENTS AS CAMEA PURCHASE GUIDES Methinks\u2026 that it is a valid approach, and the one I have taken with my first three digital cameras, M8.2, M9, M9M\u2026 that I buy the body for the character of the sensor-&-color-science-&-rendition and thus for the quality of the file it puts out. With a film camera you pick the body. With digital camera you pick the sensor-&-color-science-&-overall-rendition. After that... I think that built into the digital concept is the idea that a digital file can always be modified infinitely and thus taken from ANY one state to ANY other state. But in practice it has turned out quite differently. The bundle of dots are so damn complex that once set in place moving them through more-or-less fixed routines can create something new but not necessary anything you want to look at. Simple adjustments can of course be made but finally one must admit that starting at A and going to B to C is possible but going to D, E, F, etc. may not be possible or result in anything wants to display. In my experience adding a lot of major changes to the file makes it look like a cartoon. Way back in college (school) I took an electronic music course that told us that by combining multiple sine waves ANY sound could be produced, they called this sound producing equipment a \"synthesizer\". Well if you went through that era of music of the 1960's and 70' you know that, mostly electronic sounds were just a few weird sounds, they only had a few special places in music\u2026 this \"do anything\" technology just resulted in mostly output meant for the trash heap. As good as post production software is, the original file is still the basis for the excellence eventually achieved. As effects are added on, the picture begins to be more synthetic looking, and this adjusted-synthetic-realism aesthetic is the new approach in camera created art. I will be picking bodies for their original file making abilities and not expecting to fix-it-in-post. I will pick the body like I would pick film, for the basic beauty of its file presentation. I will not trick myself into thinking that all can be fixed, changed, solved, or made more perfect in post production software. Due to user comments and internet pictures, it is evident that the Leica M10 is a landmark camera worth buying and saving as part of the history of digital cameras for the rendition of its sensor-color-science module that maintains a sort of perfect balance between realistic-detail and an atmospheric-lack-of-detail also known as \"art\". The Leica M10-R is a proof that going up in resolution creates a new ultra-detail look that is an aesthetic all its own, in some cases called by painters \"still life\" (see my other post). I hope to own both bodies someday\u2026 the M10 for atmospheric artsy look and the M10-R for the super realistic still life's that I also love. These are opposite aesthetics. I wish they could be both pulled from one camera through a menu option and probably they will be someday. Could the M10-R get a firmware update to add the old M10 aesthetic to it? If so it would help justify its tremendous cost. Someone may have achieved these through post production efforts, but if so, I do not have their weblink! Erwin Putts commented the same about a certain 90mm aspherical lens making the picture so sharp that the skin in portraits was too intimate and lacked the beauty created by lessor resolving lenses. This is the downside of high resolution which I hope can be fixed in post. You either like this super detail or you don't. It is a bit polarizing. If you paid $8k USD for the body then you say you like it, if you haven't bought the camera yet then you can have any opinion you want. Me I want both. The next iteration of high resolution camera will probably be even better for the still life super detail aesthetic so I will wait and see what Leica comes up with. Steve has shown that raising pixel count on a file gives clearer focus but of course no new detail so a truly higher resolution sensor is needed to raise the bar.

Jeff Jeff, I have only made a few prints so I cannot answer with precision. I did a (dual souce) color profile with an XRite colorchecker but if there are differences between that and the native Adobe profile I can't see them. I use ACR and PSCC.

Yes, the camera was sent to Wetzlar and as you described, it is extremely frustrating and annoying as M10 is the most unstable digital camera I own. I owned my first DC since 1998 and even the cheapest one was much more stable than M10. I have a friend who own an M10 and he also have bad experience such as needed to remove battery to fix a freeze. I have to say again I don't expect M10 is perfect, but I expect it can be repaired and I also expect the customer service can be better. I even asked them to bear the cost of shipping for this time but they refused. What makes me really upset is the screen protector was scratched after repairing. If I am the technician who made the scratch, I must replace for a new one for the customer rather than pretends nothing happened. This is the basic norm of a responsible after service department, right? But the Leica customer service didn't even reply \"I am sorry that your protector is scratched because......\" after I made the complaint. They perfer to remain silence. If the Leica service could not even do right in such minor aspect, how can I trust the whole repairing service and customer department? I have already send quite a lot of long emails to reflect the problems but what I can get is \"resend the camera for inspection\". They don't promise anything or try to do something.

I had in the past the first version of the X100, and I loved it. It was not my top, but they say X100v is so much better than the previous version. Or cameras such as XT-4 ... I heard great things about it. And I also see many people using the Sony FF mirrorless. The IQ, large quantity of third parts lens/accessories, it's very customizable. For the people here having M system and mirrorless cameras (but not Leica L-mount), which brand do you use/prefer? Panasonic, Fuji, or Sony? I never considered Fuji because the lack of FF cameras under $2.5k I have used and still own several systems from m4/3rd Oly EM5, APSC Fuji XT2 & X100. I have always been intrigued by Leica. I recently tried M10 and was quite smitten by it but still rather apprehensive being manual rangefinder. I don\u2019t think I could make justice to that $$$ with my photography. I got Q2 instead for many reasons: size, fix lens 28mm 1.7 Lux, macro mode, FF, AF and still give me the taste of Leica. I think this is enough to give my photography a \u2018spark\u2019 for now. Maybe will own an M one day....maybe... I will be selling my m4/3rd - love their lenses, excellent quality and small sizes but their sensor is kinda outdated. Will be keeping my fuji as I just love using it. Love it\u2019s colour and film simulation, never have issue with APSC. Just sold my X100F and upgraded to X100V just for the lens upgrade & flip LCD.

Then when the edits are completed in Nik just click on \"save\" within the Nik plugin and the image is automatically exported back into Lightroom as a new virtual image.

What do you mean by destructive if i may ask? Just that you can't make a few edits in SFX, move back to LR and then go back to SFX and change what you did there without starting from scratch. You can use a separate file as others have said below, but then you're starting from the top again. I tend to edit an image, leave it for a day then come back to it and pull back on my over-zealous editing. This is impossible in SFX due to the destructive nature (unless I am missing something?).

The only way to show grain. - and I film days one did all that one could do to avoid showing grain - is to use film and print on silver-gelatin paper. As soon as you move to a scan of your negative or paper print you go from grain to electronic noise. I have a high-res dedicated 35mm scanner which shows grain in almost the same way as my enlarger! Grain is a part of the negative itself, scanning doesn't get rid of it and it certainly does pick it up (though cheaper scanners can introduce colour and luminescence noise just like a digital camera on top of it). I actually really like subtle grain in bnw as I feel it gives your eyes something to lock on to.

I could use my Nikon Z setup but I prefer the size of the Leica gear. But every time I go away I struggle with the M240. I\u2019m not quick to focus with it. The preview images are seriously bad and you can\u2019t really check the focus on them. I often wish I could disable the screen so I don\u2019t have the temptation to check it and annoy me. I just don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having fun. So yesterday I put the M240 away and just stuck to the Q and had fun. Maybe I\u2019m fighting between two ways of working? I often think I should put the Q away for a while and focus on the M240 but it seems nuts to shelf a \u00a33000 camera when it\u2019s *such* a good camera. Before I had the Q I had a Fuji X100s and loved it to bits. One camera. One focal length. It made me feel like I was Joel Meyerowitz on the streets of New York. Silly but such fun. The Q is my most used camera for this decade. The M240 was bought with some money my dad left me so I feel obligated to enjoy it but it\u2019s been 2 years now and I\u2019m not sure I am. How do I enjoy it more? I\u2019m travelling now in the Netherlands and would love to have some fun with it. @petecarr, Focusing with an M camera takes some practice. Speed and accuracy of focus will come with time; it's all about time with your eye glued to the eyepiece of the camera. The more hours you spend that way, the more hours you hone your focusing technique, the sooner focusing proficiency will start to appear. Some M users will say this is an abomination, but you might think about stopping down your lens from wide open one or two f/stops while perfecting your technique; this will give you a bit of room for error and will help avoid shots where focus is missed. Be mindful to not use this technique long term, as it will then become a crutch and hold you back from maximizing your low light shooting and the shallow depth of field that your M lenses have to offer. Yes, the rear screens of the M240 cameras are not that great for determining critical focus, depending on which lens you are using. With my 90 Summicron, I had to make myself quit looking at the rear screen to try to determine if I had nailed focus. The images on the rear screen of my M-P 240 always look terrible with that lens. I had to learn to focus with relentless attention and ignore the rear screen. My 90 Summicron shots come out well focused probably 90% or more of the time; what I had to learn was to stop second guessing my focus based on what the rear screen was showing me. While you are traveling in the Netherlands, think about shooting with your M240 75% of the time so you can get better with focusing it and shoot with your Q 25% of the time just for fun or when you need autofocus and/or the higher ISO range the Q has to offer. Don't give up on your M240 and manual focus - it will come with time and practice. If you persevere, in time quicker, accurate focusing will become second nature. These are just my thoughts, based on my own experience. Good luck and keep us posted! Edit Given that you have been struggling with focusing your M240 for two years, I am wondering if your rangefinder mechanism is out of calibration. I would consider that as a possible reason for your focusing issues. If none of the above helps, talk to your Leica dealer in the UK and ask them to take a look at your M240 to evaluate it and make a recommendation.

Here is the thing, everybody takes longer to focus when the DOF is shallow, and it is harder to check focus in the LCD. So saying you aren't fast enough and it's impossible to check focus is trying to set yourself apart rather than doing what everybody does, and has done from the days of film, use workarounds. This is what I was hoping for. Some tips on what normal people do with the camera because I feel like I've got a good understanding and if I'm doing everything right and still not enjoying it then maybe its not for me. 3 hours ago, 250swb said: The first thing to do is ask yourself why all good photojournalists who use Leica's tend to stick with the 'f/8 and be there' motto, it works because you use DOF to get everything important in focus and focusing is faster because you know you have some latitude with DOF to play with. So for fast moving events use f/8, or f/11, or f/16 because with the M240 you have another workaround, set the ISO to 'Auto' and let it take care of itself setting the minimum shutter speed limit so you don't get camera shake or subject movement. Thanks. But yeah it seems I'm doing some things right. I do walk around with it set to f8. I have years of experience using my big Nikon D800/700 on M without auto-iso because I want to be in control. I use f/1.x for creative reasons because sometimes I like subject isolation. Maybe for the simplest of reasons to photograph my wife while we're sat in a cafe. 3 hours ago, 250swb said: It's probably also worth considering fast lenses with shallow DOF were a requirement for low light, and when used focus bracketing the shot was, and is, a good idea. Now that people think shallow DOF is 'artistic' and is used for it's own sake focusing is never going to be fast, so develop a habit, perhaps in this order focus on the subject, then a fraction behind, then a fraction in front, each bracket will hopefully cover your own or the subjects movement between focusing and pressing the shutter. Do it the same each time and in your editing your shots you'll know which was supposed to be sharp, then see if either of the other two are sharper. Thanks. That's something I never considered.

Yeah I may have to try and accept that I don't have the experience for f/1.4 just yet and use f/2 or f/2.8. Just a bit annoying with the ISO limitations on the 240. I'm used to ISO 6400 on my work cameras. Even my old Nikon D700 was \"ok\" at that and it's 11 years old. So it's a little hard limiting myself to 3200. The other night we were out around The Hague and it was foggy. I tried with the M240 and I really had to push it to get results. I almost wish I'd bought a M10 instead. I nearly did but decided the \u00a34000 difference for a bit better ISO was crazy.

Stopping up leads to even more unsharp images.....My recommendation so far: do not use color contrast filters at all... This mirrors my own experience using a red filter on different Ms (M8.2; M9-P; M9M; M-D Typ 262) but not with other colours of filter. The first couple of times I used a red filter I thought I had focussed poorly so tried again taking extreme care. No difference. I then thought that perhaps the quality of filter was perhaps making the images soft - perhaps the surfaces were not ground perfectly flat / perfectly parallel so I (eventually) managed to pick up a Leitz filter. No Difference. I then thought about the possibility that the focus-point might be changed (such as when using infra-red) so did slightly near-focus / correct-focus / slightly long-focus tests. No difference but I'm still not ruling this idea out...

The compiler's findings would imply that best performance is at ISO 160 (if max Dynamic Range also equals optimum performance/results) which is different to the conclusions of Sean Reid in Reid Reviews. Always interesting. However, we need to remember that dynamic range is a general principle covering all kinds of analog devices and their signals, not just cameras. (Note that a \"digital\" sensor itself is an analog device - the sensor outputs electrons/charge/voltage/signal in amounts or levels analogous to the photons that are input. It ain't digital (1s and 0s) until that analog output runs through a separate chip; the analog/digital converter.) An orchestra has a dynamic range - the faintest music it can produce playing ppp (very very softly) to the loudest music it can produce playing fff (very very loudly). A recording of that orchestra will have its own dynamic range, depending on the capabilites of the microphones and recording medium (wax disc, magnetic tape). And a playback of that recording will have yet another dynamic range, based on where the playback system introduces distortion (\"rumble\" or \"fuzz\" in loud sounds), and a \"noise floor\" (clicks, pops, tape hiss in the soft sounds). (If you go to a concert, and in the pianissimo parts, you can hear the coughs and feet-shuffling of the audience, or the creaking of the seats, that is also a \"noise floor.\" The music can't be heard \"pure\" and \"correctly\" at that low volume.) The analogies (hah!) in photography are blown or miscolored highlights (distortion), and shadow noise (noise floor). And the rated or tested dynamic range will (or should) exclude those sounds or brightnesses (recognizable, even if \"damaged\") that contain distortion and/or noise beyond a very limited amount (Typically, 1-3% of the total signal/sound/brightness range). When I made a shirt-cuff test of the color M10 at ISO 100 and 200 (as mentioned by Uliwer, but a different thread than the saturation one), I noted that at 200 the distortion was lower (better protection of highlights). But I also noted that at ISO 200 the noise floor was higher (the same shadows adjusted to the same brightness were noisier). I would imagine that someone doing a rigorous DR measurement (DxO or photonstophotos) is going to measure both ends of the scale, and subtract range that shows additional noise in excess of some very low limit as \"not really counting\". Thus in, for example, the color M10, the loss in the highlights at ISO 100 is outweighed by the lower noise in the shadows, for a net higher dynamic range than ISO 200, when graphed. We as photographers are usually most concerned with blown highlights as a measure of DR. But that's really only half the story. ___________________ Of note: LCD screens have a DR of about 10 stops, and glossy print paper has a DR of about 7 stops. Therefore we will never actually be able to see a full DR of 11 stops or higher on our screens or in a print - without manipulations. We can fiddle with the screen brightness or print brightness to see one end or the other better - but not both ends at once. But the higher DR does allow more headroom or footroom for manipulations.

In another thread, I posted a couple of M10 B&W pictures as an example of the tonality, gradation and resolution where I wanted to be in B&W, for which I thought the M10 was perfectly adequate. I wrote also that I prefer the greater flexibility of digital filters from post-processing to glass contrast filters. Indeed, I previously had the M-Monochrom and prefer the M10 in this respect. Some background Having published my book last November, I'm now thinking about another project. I've been posting a series of images in a (tentative) series called Empire of Signs, the title of Roland Barthes' book about Japan. I don't believe in jumping directly into defining a new project: rather i tend to take pictures and see how this leads me to a project; so, Empire of Signs may not lead anywhere. When I was in Tokyo at the end of November, I bought a new, 2019 edition of Moriyama Daido's Light and Shadow, which was published in 1982. The latter first edition came out ten years after his previous book and three years after he stopped photographing altogether. As I recall, he got back to photographing after looking at the first photograph ever made, the one by Ni\u00e9pce, which was an eight hour exposure of the view out of a window: it had a building and showed just light and shadow. Moriyama's book established a narrative between light and shadow. Some of the pictures in Light and Shadow are things at the verge: scruffy plants, for examine, at the edge of a store. Photographing in Thailand, often in the harsh, midday sun, I've been thinking about this type of image, and how it could be worked into the Empire of Signs.Today, I made the picture below. M10 | DR Summicron 50 | ISO 200 | f/11.0 | 1/250 sec--img--  Chiang Mai \u2013 The Empire of Signs Coming to the point To get the look that I wanted: the dark leaves in the shade and the much lighter tone of the leaves where the sun hits them, as well as getting the poster at the left to be dark enough, I used the color sliders in Lightroom, as well a strong contrast increase. I could have done this with a Monochrom camera, but the adjusting the M10 colors gives me more control. On the other hand, with the M10M, I might be able to show more detail in the leaves, which could also be interesting Perhaps a better example is the image below, shot in dappled sunlight. I've posted a couple of images of these three tourists taking a group selfie of themselves using an iPhone on a tripod stick.

I had a thought as that while I save money, I'm busy researching lenses. I was considering the ultimate purchase I hope to make sone day, the SUMMICRON-M 50 APO. Of course I'll rent one and try it out first....but the thought occurred to me about the \"APO\" aspect of it. If I understand correctly, this is for correction of chromatic aberrations.....but, if I'm shooting a M10 Monochrom camera, do I really care about this? Would an APO vs a non-APO lens make much if any difference to me since I'll never be shooting color with the camera?

This was a thread of M10M vs earlier mono cameras, but you are asking how it is vs an S. Short answer: Very good. Long answer: Jeff, I have only done a same subject comparisons on a monitor, not printing the same subject side by side because I was only trying to satisfy myself that my using the M10M was not putting myself at a disadvantage versus the S. The attached photos show a crop from a 30\"x45\" print, showing a 6\" wide crop from the 30\" wide shot which I have also included from the M10M. Both cameras were hand held at minimum iSO. Using the M10M does not put me technically at a disadvantage vs an S 007. As you said, ergonomics are different. The S is easier to shoot, but not to carry. The 30\"x45\" prints I have made from the M10M have been technically fantastic. I couldn't tell one from an S print, but again, I haven't printed the exact same subject. I don't have matched lenses to make it a scientific comparison. I have a 12, 21, 50 and 90mm for the M, and a 24, 30-90, and 120mm for the S. My closest comparison has been the 120 S (effective 96mm) vs the 90M which is what I tested. Pixel peeping it was a toss up to see the difference in my initial monitor test. But what would be proper is to look at two huge prints. You have motivated me to do a print test with something worth printing twice at my preferred printing size of 30\"x45\". That won't be this week, as oddly enough, I am working on a color project. With the Pandemic, give me a lot of time. Incidentally, there is one image I have posted on the M10M forum as well as on the S forum. Both were rainbows. I just went back to convert the S color shot to B&W and noticed that the M10M was shot at 3200 and the S was at 400. The M10M won in B&W, in part because even though I could see tight noise in the huge enlargement of the M10M, it was sharper. I didn't notice it before the comparison, but I had a tiny amount of camera shake with the S visible at truly extreme enlargement. Or was the Bayer filtration softening the edges? So, unless I had used a tripod, and both were a grab shots, the M10M wins thanks to ISO advantage that allowed shooting a 1/250 with the M, or maybe no Bayer array. So again, the M10M is a game changer because of the ISO range, and yes that much better than earlier mono cameras. Otherwise, don't trust me; what's smarter is for you to do your own test, or convince Josh at Leica Miami to do a test.

The 30\"x45\" prints I have made from the M10M have been technically fantastic. I couldn't tell one from an S print, but again, I haven't printed the exact same subject. I don't have matched lenses to make it a scientific comparison. I have a 12, 21, 50 and 90mm for the M, and a 24, 30-90, and 120mm for the S. My closest comparison has been the 120 S (effective 96mm) vs the 90M which is what I tested. Pixel peeping it was a toss up to see the difference in my initial monitor test. But what would be proper is to look at two huge prints. You have motivated me to do a print test with something worth printing twice at my preferred printing size of 30\"x45\". That won't be this week, as oddly enough, I am working on a color project. With the Pandemic, give me a lot of time. Incidentally, there is one image I have posted on the M10M forum as well as on the S forum. Both were rainbows. I just went back to convert the S color shot to B&W and noticed that the M10M was shot at 3200 and the S was at 400. The M10M won in B&W, in part because even though I could see tight noise in the huge enlargement of the M10M, it was sharper. I didn't notice it before the comparison, but I had a tiny amount of camera shake with the S visible at truly extreme enlargement. Or was the Bayer filtration softening the edges? So, unless I had used a tripod, and both were a grab shots, the M10M wins thanks to ISO advantage that allowed shooting a 1/250 with the M, or maybe no Bayer array. So again, the M10M is a game changer because of the ISO range, and yes that much better than earlier mono cameras. Otherwise, don't trust me; what's smarter is for you to do your own test, or convince Josh at Leica Miami to do a test. Jack --img--  --img--  Thanks, Jack. I appreciate your follow up. Please don't go out of your way to test. As you suggest, I always do my own demo of potential new gear, shooting my own pics and making prints. I rarely do any detailed A/B testing, though....life is too short....but I do make judgments about gear once I've accumulated enough data points from real life pics and prints, not pixel peeping. Usually my gut tells me. (And IQ these days is so good from so much gear, that judgments and purchase decisions are usually more on the basis of viewing/focusing, handling and ergonomics, menus/controls, lens options, etc). With regard to the S vs the M10 Monochrom b/w output, I anticipated that you might have some gut reaction, particularly with respect to tonality and tonal transitions, perhaps resulting from the bigger S sensor. Others often comment about the 'feel' of S pics vs those from 'full frame' high MP cameras such as the SL2, with the former being more 'organic' in some way, even if not technically superior. The fact that you need to do more testing to draw some better conclusions already suggests to me that you don't have a similar immediate reaction. I'm currently happy with my M10, M Monochrom and SL2 (relatively new). I haven't tested the M10 Monochrom and probably won't any time soon. I knew you embraced the S system and enjoyed big prints (mostly from reading Mike Johnston over at TOP), so I thought I'd ask you about IQ/print rendering compared to your M10M. Thanks again.

They had managed to reduce its size to that of an M7, to speed it up, quieten the shutter and streamline the operation. Then came the M10-P with an even quieter shutter. The M10-Monochrom retains the quieter shutter of the M10-P, but adds a completely new 41mp monochrome sensor (7864 x 5200 pixels). Of course this brings up a number of immediate questions: Are the M lenses good enough to support such resolution? Does anyone really need this much black and white resolution? Is the M10 electronics sufficient to deal with such big files? Is it possible to hold the camera steady enough with no Stabilisation? Is it possible to focus accurately enough with the rangefinder I\u2019ll be looking at these questions in the course of this article. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my job is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical and I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not asked what to write, and although I do show them to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. In the past (and always by chance) it has turned out that testing cameras has coincided with one of our trips abroad. This time it hasn\u2019t been the case, what\u2019s more I\u2019ve had a pretty busy time at work, so, apart from a brief working trip to Cornwall (where it rained every day), the images accompanying this article have mostly been shot within walking distance of home (or in a local pub!). The Body The M10-Monochrom body is a beautiful thing, and I think this might just be the loveliest of all the variants (perhaps of all the digital M cameras). The body is a stealthy black chrome, with no red dot (just the big screw of the M10-P). It has no logo on the top plate, just the word MONOCHROM engraved in small letters at the front (mine also has P03/15 engraved to indicate it\u2019s prototype status). On the back it says LEICA CAMERA WETZLAR - MADE IN GERMANY, but like the engraving on the top plate this is not picked out In colour. The shutter speed dial has the shutter speeds picked out in white (as usual), but the A setting is grey rather than red, and this goes for the M setting on the ISO dial and the red dot on the on/off. The rear plate is the same as a normal M10, with LV, PLAY and MENU buttons on the left and a 4 way rocker switch on the right with a central button. The thumb wheel and it\u2019s bump are also the same as the M10. The whole effect is very discreet and really smart. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> Operation, Speed, and Menus If you put a much larger sensor into a camera with the same processor you are inevitably going to have an impact on the speed of processing, and it\u2019s certainly the case with the M10-Monochrom. Shot to shot times, writing to disk and review times are all slower. So perhaps it isn\u2019t the camera for sport! On the other hand I mostly use Sandisk Extreme Pro 64Gb 95ms SD cards, and with the camera on continuous-fast it takes 10 DNG files at high speed before pausing, and another 10 before really slowing down. I can\u2019t imagine anyone using continuous on a camera like this, but it does show that for measured shooting the slightly slower processing times are unlikely ever to cause an issue. Certainly I\u2019ve never been inconvenienced by it. On the rare occasion the camera is behind itself reading or rendering a file it shows the file number (rather than a question mark or error). If you\u2019re a fast shooter, then you should be aware of the issue, but for most normal photographers it won\u2019t ever be relevant. The important point is that as far as I\u2019m aware there is no shutter lag involved, whether you use the EVF or not. I\u2019m not going into the menu system in any detail. As expected, it is pretty much identical with the M10, but with colour and white balance options removed. Having spent much of the last year using Panasonic and Fujifilm cameras it\u2019s a real joy getting back to Leica\u2019s simple but functional menu system. I think it\u2019s sometimes overlooked how much purpose and determination Leica put into keeping it like this. Focusing and Image Stabilisation (or not) The Leica M Rangefinder (or, in German, Messsucher, hence the \u201cM\u201d) was first released in 1953, and it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to wonder whether it is still fit for purpose for a 41mp sensor 67 years later in 2020. I\u2019m not fortunate enough to own a 50 or 75 Noctilux, but I\u2019ve found rangefinder focusing with my 50 Summilux Asph and 75 APO Summicron to be easy and reliable, even wide open (I mostly shoot wide open). I have a practice game I play, which involves focusing with the rangefinder, and then checking whether it\u2019s correct in the EVF, it always reassures me what a wonderful tool a rangefinder still is. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> Which brings me back to the EVF. I know there have been a lot of complaints that it\u2019s rather old school, and I long since stopped using it with the M10 (I\u2019m pretty good at focusing with a rangefinder, and I like to see around the subject). I found that I liked using the EVF with the M10-Monochrom; partly because it was nice to see the image in black and white, but also for focusing: I think it works best with focus peaking turned off, and with auto zoom turned off (with zooming on the front button). For most images I found there was a shimmer of excitement over the area in focus, with no need to zoom in for critical focus. I particularly enjoyed using it with the 60mm Macro Elmarit R. I imagine that for those lucky enough to have a Noctilux or the 90 Summilux the EVF will be a real benefit, but I\u2019ll only use it when I want to see the end result before I take the picture. Surely the point of a Leica M camera is the rangefinder (at least that\u2019s how I see it). With respect to image stabilisation, of course, it would be nice to have it, but the very quiet shutter and the solid body seems to have made camera shake a relatively minor problem, and the fantastic high ISO together with the extra stop you get without the colour filter array means that you can use the ISO settings to preserve a high enough shutter speed. In this context I found the 1/f 1/(2f) and 1/(4f) minimum shutter speed in the Auto ISO settings particularly useful. Image Quality, Resolution and ISO I\u2019m afraid that I was dead set against Leica increasing the resolution from 24mp which seemed to me to be the perfect compromise between quality and convenience, resolution and file size, perfectly capable of a good sized print and fast processing. But I\u2019ve changed my mind; the extra price to pay in terms of processing power and storage space is really small in the face of the extra advantages in terms of image quality and crop-ability. With the SL2 and now the M10M I\u2019ve found myself shooting just with a 50 or a 35, when previously I would have used a zoom, or a 35 and a 75 (and the lens changes that implies). The Monochrome sensor in the M10-Monochrom foregoes the Bayer filter required in colour cameras. With a Bayer filter groups of 4 pixels (with Red, Green, Green, Blue filters) are processed in a batch and then separated into 4 pixels in the demosaicing process. This means that theoretically the Monochrom has 4 times the absolute resolution of a colour sensor. In actual fact the modern demosaicing routines are very good, and so the resolution bonus with a Monochrome sensor is perhaps more like 2 times. But that still left me wondering whether M lenses are up to a comparative resolution of 80mp. I thought I\u2019d test this with my idea of the Leica M Triumvirate: Leica 28mm Summilux Asph Leica 35mm Summilux Asph Leica 50mm Summilux Asph I shot my tame copper beech hedge at a nasty 10 metres at f1.4, f2, f4, f5.6 and f8 with each lens. Each of them lost a little at f1.4 and f2 in the very extreme corners (the 35 FLE was probably the best). Stop down a little and the corners are perfect, but even wide open all but the very corner of the frame is beautifully sharp. Unfortunately I don\u2019t own a Leica M246 Monochrom, but I do have my M9 Monochrom with the CCD sensor, and I thought it might be interesting to do some comparisons between the original Monochrom (from 2012) and this new version. I took pictures of our kitchen dresser in low artificial light with each camera on a tripod with ISO between 160 and 10,000 (for the M9M) and up to 100,000 (the maximum ISO on the M10M) I did 100 percent comparisons at natural resolution, and with the M10M scaled down to match the resolution of the M9M. I then made A4 prints at critical ISO values. What is immediately clear is that both cameras are actually quite usable right through the ISO range, but there has been a huge boost in image quality over the last 8 years, and the difference between the cameras in terms of noise amounted to about 2 - 3 stops. So that the M9M at 10,000 ISO was marginally better than the M10M at 100,000 ISO but not as good as the M10M at 64,000 ISO. Dynamic range is quite a different thing, you still have to be a little careful not to overexpose the highlights, but the amount of detail which is hidden away in the shadows in the new camera is nothing less than breathtaking. Conclusion --img--  But why a monochrome camera? Sure, it was exciting and interesting in 2012 when Leica brought out the first Monochrom, and arguably the resolution benefits were bigger then, when the M9 sensor was just 18Mp. These days converting from colour to black and white in post processing is much easier, it allows you to change the conversion on different colour channels and the higher resolution of modern sensors surely makes the increase of resolution of the monochrome sensor largely academic. But shooting with a black and white camera imposes a discipline on the photographer which can be really valuable: It really makes you think about the structure of the image and the composition whereas colour encourages a \u2018think about it later\u2019 ethos. And then there is Leica. Whilst other manufacturer\u2019s chase each others technological tails and moan about falling camera sales Leica have the courage to produce excitingly different cameras, free of the function fetish of their competitors and still brave enough to produce something which really is exciting. I\u2019m absolutely convinced by this camera and it\u2019s been a real pleasure to have it and shoot with it for the last 4 months.", "link":

cameras. The 18mp M9 Monochrom was launched in Berlin amongst much excitement in November 2012. The 24mp M246 Monochrom was announced two and a half years later on April 30th 2015. We have had to wait nearly 4 years for the latest version: the M10-Monochrom being announced on January 17th 2020. I think that for many of us the M10 was the ultimate digital expression of the Leica Rangefinder camera. They had managed to reduce its size to that of an M7, to speed it up, quieten the shutter and streamline the operation. Then came the M10-P with an even quieter shutter. The M10-Monochrom retains the quieter shutter of the M10-P, but adds a completely new 41mp monochrome sensor (7864 x 5200 pixels). Of course this brings up a number of immediate questions: Are the M lenses good enough to support such resolution? Does anyone really need this much black and white resolution? Is the M10 electronics sufficient to deal with such big files? Is it possible to hold the camera steady enough with no Stabilisation? Is it possible to focus accurately enough with the rangefinder I\u2019ll be looking at these questions in the course of this article. --img--  --img--  --img--  As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my job is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical and I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not asked what to write, and although I do show them to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. In the past (and always by chance) it has turned out that testing cameras has coincided with one of our trips abroad. This time it hasn\u2019t been the case, what\u2019s more I\u2019ve had a pretty busy time at work, so, apart from a brief working trip to Cornwall (where it rained every day), the images accompanying this article have mostly been shot within walking distance of home (or in a local pub!). The Body The M10-Monochrom body is a beautiful thing, and I think this might just be the loveliest of all the variants (perhaps of all the digital M cameras). The body is a stealthy black chrome, with no red dot (just the big screw of the M10-P). It has no logo on the top plate, just the word MONOCHROM engraved in small letters at the front (mine also has P03/15 engraved to indicate it\u2019s prototype status). On the back it says LEICA CAMERA WETZLAR - MADE IN GERMANY, but like the engraving on the top plate this is not picked out In colour. The shutter speed dial has the shutter speeds picked out in white (as usual), but the A setting is grey rather than red, and this goes for the M setting on the ISO dial and the red dot on the on/off. The rear plate is the same as a normal M10, with LV, PLAY and MENU buttons on the left and a 4 way rocker switch on the right with a central button. The thumb wheel and it\u2019s bump are also the same as the M10. The whole effect is very discreet and really smart. --img--  --img--  --img--  Operation, Speed, and Menus If you put a much larger sensor into a camera with the same processor you are inevitably going to have an impact on the speed of processing, and it\u2019s certainly the case with the M10-Monochrom. Shot to shot times, writing to disk and review times are all slower. So perhaps it isn\u2019t the camera for sport! On the other hand I mostly use Sandisk Extreme Pro 64Gb 95ms SD cards, and with the camera on continuous-fast it takes 10 DNG files at high speed before pausing, and another 10 before really slowing down. I can\u2019t imagine anyone using continuous on a camera like this, but it does show that for measured shooting the slightly slower processing times are unlikely ever to cause an issue. Certainly I\u2019ve never been inconvenienced by it. On the rare occasion the camera is behind itself reading or rendering a file it shows the file number (rather than a question mark or error). If you\u2019re a fast shooter, then you should be aware of the issue, but for most normal photographers it won\u2019t ever be relevant. The important point is that as far as I\u2019m aware there is no shutter lag involved, whether you use the EVF or not. I\u2019m not going into the menu system in any detail. As expected, it is pretty much identical with the M10, but with colour and white balance options removed. Having spent much of the last year using Panasonic and Fujifilm cameras it\u2019s a real joy getting back to Leica\u2019s simple but functional menu system. I think it\u2019s sometimes overlooked how much purpose and determination Leica put into keeping it like this. Focusing and Image Stabilisation (or not) The Leica M Rangefinder (or, in German, Messsucher, hence the \u201cM\u201d) was first released in 1953, and it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to wonder whether it is still fit for purpose for a 41mp sensor 67 years later in 2020. I\u2019m not fortunate enough to own a 50 or 75 Noctilux, but I\u2019ve found rangefinder focusing with my 50 Summilux Asph and 75 APO Summicron to be easy and reliable, even wide open (I mostly shoot wide open). I have a practice game I play, which involves focusing with the rangefinder, and then checking whether it\u2019s correct in the EVF, it always reassures me what a wonderful tool a rangefinder still is. --img--  --img--  --img--  Which brings me back to the EVF. I know there have been a lot of complaints that it\u2019s rather old school, and I long since stopped using it with the M10 (I\u2019m pretty good at focusing with a rangefinder, and I like to see around the subject). I found that I liked using the EVF with the M10-Monochrom; partly because it was nice to see the image in black and white, but also for focusing: I think it works best with focus peaking turned off, and with auto zoom turned off (with zooming on the front button). For most images I found there was a shimmer of excitement over the area in focus, with no need to zoom in for critical focus. I particularly enjoyed using it with the 60mm Macro Elmarit R. I imagine that for those lucky enough to have a Noctilux or the 90 Summilux the EVF will be a real benefit, but I\u2019ll only use it when I want to see the end result before I take the picture. Surely the point of a Leica M camera is the rangefinder (at least that\u2019s how I see it). With respect to image stabilisation, of course, it would be nice to have it, but the very quiet shutter and the solid body seems to have made camera shake a relatively minor problem, and the fantastic high ISO together with the extra stop you get without the colour filter array means that you can use the ISO settings to preserve a high enough shutter speed. In this context I found the 1/f 1/(2f) and 1/(4f) minimum shutter speed in the Auto ISO settings particularly useful. Image Quality, Resolution and ISO I\u2019m afraid that I was dead set against Leica increasing the resolution from 24mp which seemed to me to be the perfect compromise between quality and convenience, resolution and file size, perfectly capable of a good sized print and fast processing. But I\u2019ve changed my mind; the extra price to pay in terms of processing power and storage space is really small in the face of the extra advantages in terms of image quality and crop-ability. With the SL2 and now the M10M I\u2019ve found myself shooting just with a 50 or a 35, when previously I would have used a zoom, or a 35 and a 75 (and the lens changes that implies). The Monochrome sensor in the M10-Monochrom foregoes the Bayer filter required in colour cameras. With a Bayer filter groups of 4 pixels (with Red, Green, Green, Blue filters) are processed in a batch and then separated into 4 pixels in the demosaicing process. This means that theoretically the Monochrom has 4 times the absolute resolution of a colour sensor. In actual fact the modern demosaicing routines are very good, and so the resolution bonus with a Monochrome sensor is perhaps more like 2 times. But that still left me wondering whether M lenses are up to a comparative resolution of 80mp. I thought I\u2019d test this with my idea of the Leica M Triumvirate: Leica 28mm Summilux Asph Leica 35mm Summilux Asph Leica 50mm Summilux Asph I shot my tame copper beech hedge at a nasty 10 metres at f1.4, f2, f4, f5.6 and f8 with each lens. Each of them lost a little at f1.4 and f2 in the very extreme corners (the 35 FLE was probably the best). Stop down a little and the corners are perfect, but even wide open all but the very corner of the frame is beautifully sharp. Unfortunately I don\u2019t own a Leica M246 Monochrom, but I do have my M9 Monochrom with the CCD sensor, and I thought it might be interesting to do some comparisons between the original Monochrom (from 2012) and this new version. I took pictures of our kitchen dresser in low artificial light with each camera on a tripod with ISO between 160 and 10,000 (for the M9M) and up to 100,000 (the maximum ISO on the M10M) I did 100 percent comparisons at natural resolution, and with the M10M scaled down to match the resolution of the M9M. I then made A4 prints at critical ISO values. What is immediately clear is that both cameras are actually quite usable right through the ISO range, but there has been a huge boost in image quality over the last 8 years, and the difference between the cameras in terms of noise amounted to about 2 - 3 stops. So that the M9M at 10,000 ISO was marginally better than the M10M at 100,000 ISO but not as good as the M10M at 64,000 ISO. Dynamic range is quite a different thing, you still have to be a little careful not to overexpose the highlights, but the amount of detail which is hidden away in the shadows in the new camera is nothing less than breathtaking. Conclusion --img-- The easy part is to say that this camera is a joy to shoot with, a joy to handle, and produces wonderful images quite suitable to make very very big prints. The only possible functional criticism which I can find is that it\u2019s a little slow processing images and writing them to disk (SD Card). But why a monochrome camera? Sure, it was exciting and interesting in 2012 when Leica brought out the first Monochrom, and arguably the resolution benefits were bigger then, when the M9 sensor was just 18Mp. These days converting from colour to black and white in post processing is much easier, it allows you to change the conversion on different colour channels and the higher resolution of modern sensors surely makes the increase of resolution of the monochrome sensor largely academic. But shooting with a black and white camera imposes a discipline on the photographer which can be really valuable: It really makes you think about the structure of the image and the composition whereas colour encourages a \u2018think about it later\u2019 ethos. And then there is Leica. Whilst other manufacturer\u2019s chase each others technological tails and moan about falling camera sales Leica have the courage to produce excitingly different cameras, free of the function fetish of their competitors and still brave enough to produce something which really is exciting. I\u2019m absolutely convinced by this camera and it\u2019s been a real pleasure to have it and shoot with it for the last 4 months. Great report! I was hoping to find out also how old lens work? The MM1 and old lens is such a great combo and to my eyes it\u2019s the camera where vintage lens look the best. Given I only have lens from the 1950s it would be great to know if the m10M would be a good option for people like me:) thank you!", "link":

I, too, have used all three monochrom's. First, let's make an assumption that the M246 and the M10M are equivalent in image rendition (I believe the M10M is better, but bear with me). If they are equal, and the M10M provides a significantly higher pixel count for the same area, then you have your answer. The M10M has to be better to get equivalent images with smaller sized pixels, or light gathering capabilities. I'm not trying to justify upgrading from one to the other, I'm just answering the question. Second, the first point is more like philosophy than actual use. I will say that it took me about 6 months to a year to really fine tune my ability to get the most out of the camera. I've been shooting black and white film since the late 70's early 80's and developing it myself. I am far better at developing film today than I was then. I think my artistic ability has also gotten better. I'm saying, it just takes me time to get the most out of the monochrom. Third, there is visible difference in the higher ISO's and the ability to pull out shadows in the lower ISO's. I posted some images I took at ISO 50,000 and then printed at 17x22. In terms of tonality and 'noise' or 'grain', I would hang that print beside my S007 prints. I know you want DNG files to compare, but honestly, because of the pixel difference, comparing the DNG is difficult. The key to the monochrom has always been \"how much shadow detail is available, without blowing the highlights, and at minimal noise.\" The pure difference in time and technology of the CMOS chip is lower read noise, and hence, lower noise in the shadows. Everything else is the photographer's ability to determine the best exposure for the brightness of the scene and the end use of the image - small JPEG, large print for example - the camera is not in control of any of that. So IMHO, the only way to compare the monochrom's is to use a grey scale card that has 24-36 white, grey and black patches, meter for the middle grey and compare the resulting DNG files for how many stops the shadows can be increased without causing visible noise. You already know the answer, the lowest ability for shadows is the M9M, then M246 and the best is M10M. Just my opinions from use of course...

You probably have more in common than you think. I think you and JAPV are completely missing the point and not being particularly helpful and/or just being argumentative? Sorry, I think you misunderstood me. The OP was trying to gather opinions on which camera is \"better,\" M246 or M10M. Clearly, the technical specifications of the M10M are improved over M246, so for a lot of people that would make the M10M a \"better\" camera, but I don't think that's what he meant. What I responded to, which is what I think JAAPV meant, was what qualities of a camera allow you to make a better picture, because that probably is the point of getting a better camera. I think one of the greatest photographs of all time is Henri Cartier-Bresson's Derri\u00e8re la Gare St. Lazare, but it is unsharp and lacks shadow detail. It would fail as a good photograph for anyone measuring by those parameters. So, other than the technical specifications, which anyone can look up, \"better\" is highly subjective. Hence, to answer the question, as JAAPV said, \"Start by defining 'superior' in a photographic sense.\" I love the M10M, which for me is \"better\" than the M246 mostly because of the ergonomics and features. I don't care about the increased mp count (would rather it had stayed 24, frankly). But I don't think the M10M allows me to make better pictures that the M246 or any other camera.

Serious question: Is \"really biting\" a good thing or a bad thing? Response to the OP: I went from the MM1 to the M10M and initially wasn't sure I'd made a good decision. The files do not have the grit or filmic qualities of the MM1 and for a while I really missed that. After a few months I've become completely smitten with the M10M files and with the camera itself. The thinner body, the superb shutter, the controls and menu make the camera physically much more pleasant to use. As for the files, they are exceptionally clean and sharp. At first, I had some difficulty getting good whites and deep blacks without going to a lot of effort. I believe this was largely due to the fact that processing softwares took a while to develop profiles for the M10M and incorporate them into upgrades. Now, that being done, a great many files that come out of my camera need very little adjustment.

If you were to decide to expose that same scene in order to keep the highlight \"manageable\", I doubt the lowlights would be as good as they are in the DNG. Meaning you'd have to shift down the entire exposure. I think, I agree. But it's not a big deal. Yes, you have to shift down the entire exposure, set EV to -2/3 in order to protect highlights. You have to do this with the M10 IMO, too. Not so much with the M 246 nor the SL2. And it's not a big deal because the 'push-ability' (adjustment latitude) of these M10M files for shadows is amazing. The lowlights can't be pushed this hard with the M 246 nor the SL2 except at base ISO. I'm totally guessing here but I suspect that the S3 and the cut-down M10M/R sensors are BSI, likely manufactured by TowerJazz. I have only seen high megapixel ISO 3200 files that can be pushed this hard and still be so clean (with NR +20 in LR) with Sony cameras. I do have to check with the M10 though which is likely not a BSI sensor. I took a number of test shots yesterday with the M10M and the M 246 side by side in low-light, high contrast scenes but used different lenses stopped down as I didn't want to switch lenses all the time. Below here are a couple of them with the M10M first with links to DNG downloads. BTW, I really have trouble with the uploaded picture size on this forum now. For some reason I can't write the settings underneath a picture anymore without ISO appearing on the right side.

Do you actually see a noticeable difference when the shutter hits in the M10 and M9M? I don't have an M10, but I did shoot with a Leica Q for a while. The Leica Q shutter is pretty much like a Ricoh GR, you don't hear nothing. From my personal experience a shutter sound has never made anyone turn around or grabbed anyone attention, in fact I got my favourite candid shots off a Leica M8 (and trust me you can hear it when that camera fires!).

I've had the M9M, which ultimately suffered sensor corrosion and I traded in for the MM246. Loved the M9M, I tend to agree with some of the reviewers out there that it was marginally better at separating whites and very light greys than the MM246. Shadows are wonderfully malleable, even moderately blown highlights are gone forever on either of them. Still, I've gotten GREAT stuff with the MM246 and have no plans to sell it--it is a great camera in its size class. Why not the new monochrom? Simple. Pricing on used Phase One (P1) gear has come down so much that it competes with Leica. No, they are not travel, street, or sports cameras, but for studio, fashion and landscape work they are wonderful. I've been shooting an IQ250 back recently (50 MP CMOS color, 33 x 44 mm) and it clearly outperforms my M240 and SL in terms of image malleability. Carefully done b/w separations from the P1 color files are essentially equivalent to the MM246 files (e.g. Leica's 24 MP CMOS sensor without the bayer array is in my experience in the same league as the 50 MP P1 with the bayer array). I've considered the new monochrom, but am instead pursuing a P1 IQ260 achromatic back (CCD, approx. 45 x 60 mm). I've reviewed achromatic P1 sample files, and they are genuinely impressive--I have seen nothing close to their level of highlight recovery with my MM246. Resolution-wise, I could have stopped back with the 18 MP M9M. I mostly only print up to Super-B (13 x 19\") but even the ISO 1600 shots that I printed to that size were a real treat. At lower ISO I can see grain etc. on-screen at high zoom factors, but the reality is that none of it is noticeable in the prints. And yes, I have gone to bigger prints, and the files hold up well. There are two great photography museums near me--the Annenberg and the Getty--and there are no shortage of prints being exhibited that are no larger than 11 x 14\". So while it's nice to be able to \"go big\", well, good work looks good in a broad range of sizes. In this race to pack ever more pixels into less and less sensor space, I wonder if we're not missing the boat. Higher resolution is not what separates digital from that mythical film ideal that seems to be fading in at least my memory. The ability to capture color and tonality over a broad range of luminance is becoming the most important thing to me.

But since you asked, here is how Salgado handles it now: http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/the-pov-interview-sebastiaeo-salgado \"POV: When did you switch to digital? Salgado: Very recently, in 2008. After what happened in New York in 2001, airport security started to change, and in a month it became hell. I remember once, after working in Guatemala, I lost 52 rolls of film because of the X-rays at the airport. So I changed to digital, but I don\u2019t know how to edit on a computer. So what happened was that I had my assistants produce a contact sheet for me. I edit with a loupe like I always did, and when I edit they produce a work print like I always did, and when I make my final selection, we produce a negative from the digital archive in a quality that is better than when I photographed directly with a negative camera.

It can provide significant advantages. The thing I like best about the MM1, which I have in addition to the M10, is the b/w state of mind provided when shooting. I\u2019m a disciplined shooter anyway (producing similar number of pics per outing with digital as in my b/w film days), but there\u2019s still something special about an all-b/w workflow and consciously viewing the world that way, without choice. The MM1 is for those days when I just feel like it. And the results, sometimes, seem to have some special sauce that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d get with the M10, but I\u2019ll never know since I make pics, not A/B tests. I do know that the MM1 files are extremely malleable, even without use of color filters. Having the MM1 fills those mindset and IQ needs for me, lessening any desire at this point for another version (beyond the M10 platform benefits, already noted). Nothing about the MM1 screams out to me that more MP is needed. It\u2019s a Goldilocks camera as it is for my print sizes.The MM1 and M10 are both fully capable, provided of course that I do my part well.... shooting and PP/printing.

Both made of silicon. CCD's a cheaper to make than CMOS but use more power than CCD and have slower readouts. Early CMOS sensors used a lot of the sensor space for the circuits so pixel size was smaller which means noise was greater (smaller photon wells = less dynamic range). CMOS sensors cost more to design but are less expensive in the long run. For a long time now, when you look at the chip under a microscope, you can see the pixels are edge-to-edge. And with Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors, now even more so. When you buy glass from Schott (and I do), you can specify, within reason, whatever thickness you want. If Leica/Kodak/Truesense/On Semi wanted to by 0.5mm glass, it isn't a problem. And they could have easily added coatings to change the UV and IR response. It's not that big of a deal. Plenty of companies that offer coating services and you can model some pretty complex response curves. And if they had added the coatings, they wouldn't have had the 'corrosion'. Maybe the datasheet specified coatings, but, at least for a lot of cameras, the coatings aren't there. We were the first company that figured out how to re-purpose a consumer camera for vegetation remote sensing by making a filter that passed plant absorption (blue or red light) to one color channel and a plant reflection channel (NIR) to another color channel. Plants reflect the NIR because the longer, lower energy wavelengths don't have enough energy to support photosynthesis. So if you look at how a plant is absorbing and reflecting light, you can determine things like biomass, plant health, etc. We also knew how to measure the camera spectral response so we knew how the RGB channels opened and close in the visible and NIR. It turns out that the red channel is open in the red and stay open throughout the NIR while the blue and green channels don't open up until around 800nm. So we designed a filter that passed visible blue and green light, blocked red light, passed NIR from 680nm to 800nm and then blocked light above 800nm - and that was one filter on one piece of glass. That way, only the red channel saw NIR. Once you had a picture with that information, you could run the picture through a computer program to calculate things like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/313260-sensor-corrosion-analysis-and-fix-merged/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-4046433", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "313260-sensor-corrosion-analysis-and-fix-merged", "result": true, "Selector": "we designed", "selectorShort": "design", "MarkedSent": "r: brian \"ccd's are much more sensitive to ir than a cmos sensor, roughly 10x. \" nope. 100% wrong there. both made of silicon. ccd's a cheaper to make than cmos but use more power than ccd and have slower readouts. early cmos sensors used a lot of the sensor space for the circuits so pixel size was smaller which means noise was greater (smaller photon wells = less dynamic range). cmos sensors cost more to design but are less expensive in the long run. for a long time now, when you look at the chip under a microscope, you can see the pixels are edge-to-edge. and with back side illuminated (bsi) sensors, now even more so. when you buy glass from schott (and i do), you can specify, within reason, whatever thickness you want. if leica/kodak/truesense/on semi wanted to by 0.5mm glass, it isn't a problem. and they could have easily added coatings to change the uv and ir response. it's not that big of a deal. plenty of companies that offer coating services and you can model some pretty complex response curves. and if they had added the coatings, they wouldn't have had the 'corrosion'. maybe the datasheet specified coatings, but, at least for a lot of cameras, the coatings aren't there. we were the first company that figured out how to re-purpose a consumer camera for vegetation remote sensing by making a filter that passed plant absorption (blue or red light) to one color channel and a plant reflection channel (nir) to another color channel. plants reflect the nir because the longer, lower energy wavelengths don't have enough energy to support photosynthesis. so if you look at how a plant is absorbing and reflecting light, you can determine things like biomass, plant health, etc. we also knew how to measure the camera spectral response so we knew how the rgb channels opened and close in the visible and nir. it turns out that the red channel is open in the red and stay open throughout the nir while the blue and green channels don't open up until around 800nm. so -----> we !!!  -----> designed !!!  a filter that passed visible blue and green light, blocked red light, passed nir from 680nm to 800nm and then blocked light above 800nm - and that was one filter on one piece of glass. that way, only the red channel saw nir. once you had a picture with that information, you could run the picture through a computer program to calculate things like ndvi (normalized difference vegetation index).", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30229, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "dllewellyn", "date": "2020-09-15 17:37:00", "content": "RE 0.10 mm is ten times the tolerance Leica uses for sensor positioning: so the reshim will need to be 0.10 +/- 0.010 mm.

The only drawback would be the need to use flat field correction for certain WA lenses. We've used Hot Mirror filters for years, with our M8 and with some lenses on the M9. I have about 12 of them. The M8 drew much criticism over the need for external filters and the IR problem. Leica/ONSEMI avoided this completely by using BG55 glass, which is much more stable environmentally than S8612. The protective coating of the S8612 as used in the M9 did not stand up to the job of preventing corrosion. Dan claims that the Data Sheets published for years, revised a few times- are all wrong- that the M9 sensor's cover glass has no protective coating at all. If that had been the case, as per the S8612 Data Sheet- the corrosion problem would have been much worse than it was. Schott states that unprotected S8612 glass will corrode after a few months. My M9 went 7 years. Dan's article on MaxMax labeling Kodak and Leica as \"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid\" does not identify the glass, which is specified in the Datasheet. The Data Sheet also states that the cover glass is provided by Schott, and the performance of the cover glass in the Data Sheet is from Schott. I believe the Data Sheets from Schott and Kodak/TrueSense/ONSEMI. I work with groups that make custom glass, and make custom sensors. To state that silicon sensors are all the same was just way too much. A couple of years ago one of my coworkers needed to make a low-cost VNIR sensor, I went through the data sheets for a number of CMOS and CCD COTS sensors. The IR had been bred out of the CMOS sensors of the time, Hamamatsu CCD's had 10dB higher sensitivity in the IR. All were Silicon sensors. Same with ONSEMI CCD's without IR absorbing glass, better IR- but the emphasis had been placed on Visible. The spectral response of my DCS200ir is about the same in IR as Visible. Kodak started using Indium Tin Oxide to extend blue response. Once again- follow a technology for 40 years, you pick up some things. I hack lenses, known for converting Sonnars to Leica mount and adjusting Jupiters. That's lens hacking for relaxation.From working in an Optical Research Lab for over 40 years. I'm a Lens Hacker, but had two optical engineers work for me to design the real stuff. Kodak came to us for IR technology back in the 80s. Seemed fair that I give them a call in 2009 and ask for a Monochrome M9. I actually asked for a full-spectrum M9, told them I'd buy 6 of them. It would have been under $50K for all of them. Way cheaper than Sensors Unlimited stuff. The Kodak Engineer told me that had a meeting with Leica coming up, and they would discuss it. Kodak had wanted to do a Monochrome M8 to pick up where the DCS760m had failed- due to a banding problem. Preaching to the choir. Once I got the M Monochrom, I had to get the shim for an F1.5 J-3 and Sonnar within 0.01mm. I have about 20 5cm F1.5 Sonnars and J-3's in my collection. Past 100 lenses in Leica mount now. For the M Monochrom: the shims are optimized for different color filters. Deep color filters shift the focus towards infinity, enough to have to adjust the shim. 0.1mm is far off for a lens. I no longer do lens work- Skyllaney in the UK offers the service professionally. Gone are the days that I'd convert a Sonnar to Leica mount for $25 and left-over parts. Some of those Sonnars that I converted sell for a lot these days. All a clever plan to shoot with and take apart hundreds of lenses.

Here is the M9 ICF that I measured versus a typical ICF. --img--  I would like to study the color response and light transmission, and ideally we would have your opinions, MaxMax and Kolari. First some anecdotical points showing the importance to me of the color response which is much of the appeal of the Leica M9: 1. I used to have 5-6 years ago a Leica M9-P which had an official sensor change by Leica. The color response of the sensor had however changed, and was not just a matter of White Balance - the color palette was nice, but different; also in addition the pictures became slightly sharper, luminosity was slightly reduced and the images slightly colder (not as Kodachrome like anymore). As you know the firmware was updated after the official sensor change, which is not the case for the suggested \"only glass change\" solutions - so same camera RGB response. 2. Due to this I had bought again a Leica M9 with original sensor without corrosion at the time - I think it was one of the first ones produced - (with the feeling that if something happened I could still have the official sensor changed). The colors are indeed more like Kodachrome. I could not check the camera in time to see the spots that now in retrospect seem to have appeared around July 2020 especially since there was no pre-announcement by Leica that the sensor change program would end in Aug. Either way, I would like to stick to the \"old\" colours as much as possible if I aim to perform such as sensor glass change. Based on data from Schott, and as non expert, I am trying to understanding the color response of the two solutions being suggested, original M9, MaxMax and Kolari: - On the original M9, the original sensor cover glass was S8612 0.8mm (based on comments on this forum). Schott's official transmission data sheet here: https://shop.schott.com/medias/schott-bandpass-s8612-jun-2017-en.pdf?context=bWFzdGVyfHJvb3R8Nzk3ODUzfGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL3BkZnxoM2YvaGFlLzg4MjAyMzQ3ODA3MDIucGRmfDUzYzE4ZGI3OWY5NDU4MzY3NDZhZDc1OTk1MGQyZWU0Mzc3N2UyM2EyYWM2ZjI1MzI5ZGMzZTgwZDI2ZjNlOGQ - MaxMax: replacement cover glass BG38 0.8mm.

My 5d is still fully functional too. \"Regular\" camera manufacturers make pretty long lived cameras and tough ones too, and they do it without $8000 price tags. Granted Leicas are works of art in many ways with hand crafting and fine mechanical precision, and so on. There are certainly Canon Ps and Nikon rangefinders still working too, but MOST Leicas from that period are still functional (or at least a heck of a lot of them). I think Leica takes pride in cameras living longer than their owners and not just one or two but most of them. It's a mindset you can embrace when the camera is all mechanical (much as we embrace it with mechanical watches). But once you add electronics, well you can't make new electronic components once the production line stops. What do you do if you're Leica and you take pride in your cameras outliving their owners? Do you give up on that notion and still make cameras that SHOULD last that long but won't because what is inside will fail long before the outer shell? Or do you do crazy things to keep up the spirit of that long life (like upgrading camera internals)? I expect they will quietly transition to letting those Ms slowly become shelf queens when there are no more electronic parts from the original cameras. I understand your point.

The Mac Plus is no longer serviced by Apple (just like the Apple II machines I collect): https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 The Mac Plus (I had one in 1984) is an interesting parallel to the M9. It was a good machine with a serious design flaw. In the Plus' case it was (if I remember right) the flyback transformer which tended to fail (or even catch on fire) when it overheated. The \"fix\" for customers was to buy a fan that would slot in the top and help to keep it from overheating. A friend of mine's Plus (at E Systems in Florida) started to smoke on his desk. He disconnected it and avoided a fire. I added a fan to my home one. I'm not sure Apple ever offered any modification to fix the problem. From the beginning though, computers were sold with a limited effective life span which (for the mac) has increased over time. I still have 2 iMacs, one is a 2007 model which has been my youTube server for a few years now after retiring from home computer duty. The CD drive failed years ago and the hard drive failed yesterday! It's still running on an external drive but not well. Still, 13 years. My 2012 model is 8 years old now and it's still my basic home computer and its pretty effective at it. Macs tend to do very well in service, but nobody expects them to last for 80 years. And no other modern manufacturer tries to make cameras like that these days. Even the old Nikon and Contax rangefinders which were built quite well aren't quite up to Leica's longevity standards. After all, camera manufacturers WANT you to buy new cameras ... eventually. Building an M2 that will last 60 years isn't exactly the way to make you buy more Ms... or is it? Certainly that rugged longevity did kind of make me want to keep buying Leicas (I've only bought 6 Ms so I'm pretty much a piker, and they've all been used models too). As I said previously, the Q (and Q2) are interesting Leicas to look at relating to the M models. It kind of looks like an M. It's really well built (but not to M standards). It has a fixed lens but a very good one (to keep from competing with Ms?). I think it's weather sealed (I don't think the Ms are). It has AF and I think it has image stabilization too as well as a macro mode. It gets rid of the rangefinder in favor of a really nice EVF. In a way, except for the fixed lens, it's a fairly modern spec camera. And the cost for the camera and lens is pretty amazingly low (for Leica). If the Q2 was turned into the Leica M11 by giving it an M mount (sadly losing the AF) but retaining the image stabilization, it would be (presumably) way cheaper than an M is now (on a par with the Cls at least) but would be a full frame camera with modern specs. It would NOT have the build quality of the Ms or the expectation (even if implicit) of long survival. Owners wouldn't expect lifetime service or longer service than a Sony RX1R or a Sony a7R4. It would reflect a total transition from the \"we make cameras that last forever\" model to the \"we make great cameras with reasonable life spans.\" Leica might not be ready to cannibalize their sales of Ms (with all the special editions and variants) yet, but as more digital Ms become doorstops, it might result in failing demand for them and we might end up with a new \"M\" based on a camera like that.

I like the saturated reds of the M9 a lot. When I compare the files of the Hasselblad to the ones of the M9 the behavior of the sliders in Lightroom is very different.

Does it use the corresponding new firmware for M9s with the replacement sensor? For others: When Leica revised the 28 Elmarit ASPH to take the new external-thread lens hood, was the optical formula tweaked (as with the 28 Summicron v.2) to improve corner resolution on digital? This seems to imply that is true: https://photorumors.com/2016/01/14/new-leica-summicron-m-35mm-f2-asph-summicron-m-28mm-f2-asph-and-elmarit-m-28mm-f2-8-asph-lenses/ And has anyone compared the 'New\" and \"Original\" 28 Elmarit ASPHs on an M9 with the original, corrodable sensor - or on the revised sensor? And does Leica distinguish between the new and old lenses, either as to catalog number, or as to 6-bit code (which controls green-corner removal)? I'm just wondering if, in having two optical versions of a lens, two versions of a sensor (M9 CCD i and ii), and two versions of the camera firmware (which includes the in-camera color-vignetting profiles) - ALL OR ANY OF WHICH could change the amount of green vignetting produced - something got lost in translation. It may just be a question of - using a 2-generation-old M9, use the older-generation lens. For the record, I've been trying out a v.1 28 Elmarit ASPH on an M10 (yet another, different sensor and firmware, obviously). No significant green corners. Hi, I have the original Elmarit 28mm Asph. My original M-E (corroded) sensor use to work fine with this lens, no green color cast in the corners. Sensor changed back in 2017, from there I've started seeing exact same issue as described. Actually some pics from my camera can be seen in the older post on the subject. I never got feedback from Leica and I've assumed Leica will not come up with a new corrected lens profile, i lost hope in a solution for M9/M-E. Btw, the 21mm profile is different but not much better, i tried all. B&W works fine though. Forgot to add, with the new sensor came the new Fw, so I'm not sure if the issue is the new sensor or the new firmware...

They bend over backwards over the phone or via email to keep me happy. The 788T I have has a noisy channel 7. My last communication was send it in and we will fix it for free. Their current top of the line recorder, the Scorpio, is just under US$10K. These are quality, and expensive, products.

I don't expect any camera manufacturer to support sensors after fifteen years, even if the camera was $7000 new. Analog cameras are a different story because any skilled repair person could keep it running long past it's introduction. Digital cameras require proprietary tools and equipment to maintain repairs. Most of those repairs are not repairs at all, but replacement of assemblies, no different than a computer. Now if Leica is still repairing or maintaining cameras at twice the cost of purchasing a used working camera, good for them. However, as a professional user I don't see that as a good ROI if I'm paying $2000+ in repairs for a camera that has a resale value of well less than $1500. YMMV.

In Sept. 2019 after about 10 years I have changed from the M8.2 to an M10-P and never regretted it one single day. All things M8.2 did are done much better by M10-P, as higher usable ISO, faster image storage and higher battery capacity. Not to forget those pleasant conveniences such as constant image control by display or electronic viewfinder, the spirit level or the net grille.

It sounds hard but it's better to spare for a much more modern digital Leica-M like an M10 than investing your hard earned money into outdated stuff like M8. Peter Karbe, chief lens designer of Leica, told from the M8 as his most hated digital Leica-M, an important and necessary step for Leica but now only history. As the owner of an M (typ 240), SL, CL digital, M 8.2 and a D-Lux, I tried the M10 and in comparison to the SL and the M (typ 240), I didn't see a big enough differential except for the Visoflex 020 v. the EVF 2. The SL, though bigger, outperforms the M10 on several bases. To start, the AF lenses make it a virtual DSLR for fast shoots, the M-Lens Adapter allows me to use my precious glass on an advanced body and the focus peaking is not overly contrasted (it's adjustable). I'm heavily invested in Leica and I have created a flexible kit with the adapters and camera choices. I recently bought a mint 35-70 R-mount and adapter for less than $500 (U.S.) for the M (tip 240) and am enjoying telephoto on an M camera for the first time. Conversely, I purchased the fixed lens D-Lux because I was being denied entry into certain concerts and venues with my replaceable lens camera bodies. I love the M 8.2 because the 10.3 mp CCD sensor is special. Its simple menu, classic look and feel, renders certain subjects excellently. Plus, with the RF calibrated properly, my pictures are sharp enough for what I need it for (up to 8 x 10). Having wrestled with new technology v. old, the only tech that counts is the photographer and what he seeks to render. Like golf, a bad golfer with the best equipment is still a poor golfer, while a good golfer with the worst equipment can still shine. The 10m/M10-P is a wonderful camera, but its incremental improvements did not improve my experience with what I already have.

A \"jammed camera\", where shutter button would not move, and film advance would not move, but I did not look at the display when this happened but it may have been like yours. FIX From Leica Repair: This unjammed my M7 shutter, the shutter release button, the film advance system, and the electronic system: Leica service told me to put it in Bulb mode, then tap the shutter release a few times to get the shutter release to jump up, since the shutter release is probably jammed in the down position. Apparently, Bulb mode is some kind of shutter-computer reset or starting point. Well that is the best sense I can make of it. Probably the camera needs to be in the power-on position with batteries installed. It is easy to have it turned off when you think it is on. Possibly move the advance lever back & forth a little bit, and turn it off-&-on. I tried so many things that it is hard to remember the exact order of all I tried before following the above directions from Leica. CAUSE: This may have been caused by, my removing the batteries, without first turning the camera power to Off.

I think I have to make my own experiences and figure it out myself. It's a fully subjective question, after all. I was close to buy old 35 1.4 Lux once, but went for NIB Summarit-M 35 2.5. Zero regrets. Back then, original 35 1.4 Nokton was way too often reported as disaster for huge focus shifts even at f8. (This is way many here care about focus shift most, BTW). I was never tempted to buy bad lens like this. But they say it was improved with manufacturing modification of original Nokton 35 1.4 later on. Once 35 1.4 II came and I have seen reports with images I purchased it strictly for M-E 220 to deal with limited ISO range. IMO: From what I have seen from old Lux, 35 1.4 II Nokton is better lens @f1.4 on digital and I need f1.4 lens. On BW film I'm not impressed with any of two 35 1.4 Nokton's versions. From what I have seen in reports, including latest .They are kind of lacking of rendering of small details and flat in rendering overall. Same as Color Skopar 35 2.5, but more quirks. I'm finding old Lux to be better on BW film, but my Summarit-M 35 2.5 is astonishingly good on BW and color film. I also think old Lux is better for bokeh @f1.4 with busy, not even, chaotic background. IMO. 7 hours ago, Harpomatic said: Hi lct, what I meant is this: if the field were completely flat, focusing with the rangefinder patch and then recomposing would move the focus plane behind the intended subject, because it\u2019s like sliding a flat panel on the surface of a sphere when you recompose. This assuming that you stay in the same place while recomposing, like we all do. Should you just step sideways and raising/lowering the camera remaining on the same plane it would work for maintaining the subject in focus. A lens with a field curvature curving away from the lens would be even worse. But the field curvature towards the lens is more aligned with the movement of the DOF while recomposing, so you have a better chance to keep the subject within it.

Please note, I am generally really picky, so some might be happy with a lens I have issues with, or it could just be my copy of the lens: 15mm Voigtlander Version 1 : Very badly. Lots of smearing and color vignetting 18mm Distagon ZM : Pretty poorly on adapted bodies. Usable on the M9, M10. Have not tried on the SL2. My guess is ok from 8 or 11. 25mm Biogon ZM: Badly on adapted bodies, but usable for things like APS-C video. As described above for the SL2. Superb lens on film. Quite good on the M's Simply not designed for digital, but a really great lens optically. 28mm Summicron: Badly on the Sony. I sold it after that, so I cannot be sure, but my feeling is that it is has larger problems than the most recent M lenses. Brilliant on the M9 and M8 and of course film. 28mm Elmarit V3: Mine was better than the Summicron on the M9 and Sony. It is more retrofocal. Showing its age, however, on high resolution bodies. I have not tested with the SL2, but it did not seem to do as well on the M10 or S1, which I found a bit odd, as it is not that much higher in resolution than the M9. 35mm Summilux FLE: What I would consider the first M lens that is good on cameras with a bit thicker cover glass. It is still affected as compared to use on an M body, but I found it usable on the SL2 and S1 (especially when stopped down). It has some weird field curvature at times (so if you focus on infinity, the edges will be sharper closer to you than at infinity), but overall it is a great lens that handles well and takes pictures that you can't really complain about. 50mm Summilux ASPH. Oddly, this lens has more troubles than the 35mm FLE, despite being longer. I did not find it very good on the S1, and it was quite bad on the Sony cameras. This is why I bought the 50mm Summicron SL for the l mount, and I am very happy I did. I have not tried on the SL2, but I suspect the issue is the same. It is not that you cannot use it, it is just that its performance is substantially degraded. Use it on film or an M camera and you will see how much better it is in reality than it appears on these adapted bodies. 75mm Summicron ASPH. Like its close relative, the 50mm ASPH, its performance is somewhat degraded on adapted bodies for whatever reason. It is stunning on the M cameras, and while quite good and definitely usable on the adapated cameras, it is nowhere near its peak performance. 75mm Summilux Strangely, it is optically better on adapted digital than the more modern Summicron. It functions like it does on M bodies...lots of aberrations and glow wide open, it improves rapidly after 2.5 and becomes very sharp at 4, 5.6 and above. Still a fantastic and versatile lens. 90mm APO Summicron. Very very good. I noticed high detail edged to edge wide open on the SL2, though there was some spherical aberration (so it looked slightly fuzzy/double image wide open, though the detail was sharp). It improved rapidly. Other than that caveat, this is a top class lens and performs admirably. 135mm Tele-Elmar M (E46 version). Still the best bargain I ever had. I got this lens in rough condition for 250 dollars in the early 2000s before the digital M's. It is still an extraordinarily good performer. It has no issues with any of the digital bodies and performed as well or better than most native lenses. It was my sharpest lens on the Sony A series cameras, and it is great on any camera. Pretty remarkable for a design as old as it is. Wide open it has a bit of spherical aberration and maybe some CA, but from 5.6 on it is basically perfect (from my recollection). P.S. The reason I am so critical about this is that I live in Iceland and our landscapes are basically very wide open and far apart, so if you point a lens at a mountain and photograph, it becomes very obvious when the lenses have problems edge to edge. All the detail is at a very similar distance to the camera (300m, a kilometer, 30km? Usually a long way), so edge to edge sharpness issues are very obvious. If you live in forested land or in cities, this stuff is not so obvious. I also work as a printer so I often make large prints of my work in the course of my job as well as my artistic practice. Anyway, all this is relative, and someone doing portraits or street work might never notice any of these issues, in which case the M lenses become a superb choice given their small size, weight, high speed and center sharpness.

It's a nice middle ground between Canon when comparing to a Leica SL series because the Sony is better than the Canon with M lenses, and the Sony is better than Nikon for video and AF. That being cleared up, here are my side by side preference in the Caterogies that matter to me so far. This is still subject to change as I've just been using the SL2-S for two weeks, and I said I would use it for one month without touching the Sony before I make a final decision. - Stills IQ: Leica wins (BY FAR). The image that it produces are so sharp and beautiful. The color science of the DNG files is so impressive that I didn't even know it was possible to produce Raw files that different from the rest. Nothing beats Leica here. - Video IQ: Leica wins. The codec is nicer, retains better information, and has a beautiful color science, similar than the stills, that is so malleable and enjoyable to grade. The stabilisation, while its not an important feature to me, is also far better on the Leica than the Sony. - Low light: Leica wins. To my surprise, as the Sony in a reference in that domain. But Leica retains the color so much better, and I prefer the fine filmic grain that is introduced at high iso rather than the over demonised look of the sony. - Portability: Sony wins. It feels half the size and half the weight. Very impressive for all it packs and all it can do. - Ergonomics & looks : Leica wins (BY FAR). It's built like a tank, and it looks gorgeous. - Lens options: Leica wins. I love that M lenses adapt so well. it's like having an M body. and the SL lenses are something out of this world. Cant compare them to the Sony plastic lens. Not even the G masters. - Enjoyability: Leica wins (BY FAR). It's inspiring. Such a pleasure to go out to take photos with it. I love that the Photo and Video menu are separated and so simple to navigate. Extreme opposite of Sony here, where nothing ever makes senses. - Battery life: Leica wins. - Autofocus performance: Sony wins. While the AFs is enough for me in stills on the SL2S, it doesn't come close to compete against Sony's Eye AF and Animal eye AF. But since I don't do action (other than my kids) and sports, I can live with it. For video, however, the AFc of the Leica is just awful, and I consider it an MF video camera. I can live with this in 90% of the scenarios I shoot it. But it's still a pity. - Screen and EVF: Leica wins, with a caveat. The EvF, while being higher spec'd on the Sony, is much nice on the Leica. Colors just look better, and its more enjoyable to me. The screen, while it's way better on the Leica, doesn't tilt up, and I feel really sad about this. I understand why It doesn't (weatherproofing and durability) but for MF in video, its really not convenient and might become with time a source of back ache. I hate the flip out screen of the sony too though. I liked better the tilt up version, which was enough for MF in video. Flip out screens are made from vloggers. I hate them because I find it very disturbing when the screen is not aligned right behind the lens. it makes everything harder and less intuitive to me. - Weather proofing: its never something I cared for, but its really a nice bonus to be able to leave the camera in the rain without caring. I've crazy videos on instagram of people showering the SL2 with an SL lens under a hose, literally. I wonder how weatherproof it is with M lenses and the Leica M-L adapter. Anyone knows?

Colors just look better, and its more enjoyable to me. The screen, while it's way better on the Leica, doesn't tilt up, and I feel really sad about this. I understand why It doesn't (weatherproofing and durability) but for MF in video, its really not convenient and might become with time a source of back ache. I hate the flip out screen of the sony too though. I liked better the tilt up version, which was enough for MF in video. Flip out screens are made from vloggers. I hate them because I find it very disturbing when the screen is not aligned right behind the lens. it makes everything harder and less intuitive to me. - Weather proofing: its never something I cared for, but its really a nice bonus to be able to leave the camera in the rain without caring. I've crazy videos on instagram of people showering the SL2 with an SL lens under a hose, literally. I wonder how weatherproof it is with M lenses and the Leica M-L adapter. Anyone knows? So overall, the only two things were the Sony wins for my use is: - portability. I don't really care for this. And when I really want a smaller package, I can always use my Q2, or even my M. -AF. Of course, that's the biggest flaw of the SL2 and it might never be fixed, but im willing to try a little harder to make it work. I just have to get unhooked to the simple auto life. If only the screen would tilt up, it might have come close to the perfect camera for me. But I love it anyway. Will I sell the sony? To be continued... Hi Steven - thanks for all your posts around the SL2-S, very helpful and informative.

How else would one implement \"digital zoom\"? You can't create data out of thin air, you simply take what you get and fit it to the desired space. Yes, it works for any lens, not just TL lenses. 6 hours ago, jaapv said: Ah - I see. Apart from the framelines (which I have no use for as I find it better to estimate the crop that I will apply more precisely on my computer screen - it is mostly not centered) it is a feature for JPG shooters. I had a small hope that Leica had implemented an algorithm that was better than simple cropping - clearly not. Thanks guys, it saves me the trouble to try it out. Here is a quick example of the function shown in Lightroom Classic, Develop module, with the crop mode enabled. I made three exposures, one full-frame, one with 1.3x crop, and one with 1.7x crop, using an M-mount Summilux 35mm lens. The output DNGs have the framing dimensions modified to suit the crop. The resulting pixel counts and FoV are easily visible. Full frame: 35mm is 'normal' on the CL format, equivalent to a ~50mm lens on FF format. --img--  Crop 1.3x: ...equivalent ~65mm lens on FF format. --img--  Crop 1.7x: ...equivalent to an ~85mm lens on FF format. --img--  I find it useful in the same way that the frame line lever on my M4-2 is useful: Looking through the viewfinder, a previsualization tool. Regards the file numbering: Whenever I do a shooting session and arrive home to look at the exposures I've made, I upload them to the computer and delete them from the camera, I erase them from the camera. So I'm always in folder 100 on the camera and the file numbers always roll up sequentially. I don't do this when I'm on travel, but then I never do a firmware upgrade when I'm traveling.

TL line up is doomed. Just like S one. It is what it is. Leica will provide minimum service for TL customers with a future CL2. Just like they did with S3 for S lenses owners.

I also made further tests with different light conditions (natural daylight, although very cloudy). I think my initial testing and problem description could have been better if I am a more experienced photographer, but in my case it was half testing half photography learning. First, my tests in chronological order and my conclusion based on your inputs. Tl;dr also at the end I downloaded the pictures to my iPhone (easiest way to check them) and noticed that the daylight shots seem better (less yellowish) on the iPhone screen, compared to the camera LCD. At that point I thought that the camera might be correct, but the LCD could have some problem. I found topics on this forum that indicated problems with camera LCDs. Side-by-side, the iPhone screen looked \"whiter\" while the camera had the tint. I found the monitor color adjustment setting, which changed the screen a little bit, but not so much. I then remembered that when I bought my iPhone (XS) I found it to be more yellowish than the previous one, and I went into the settings and changed the hue to blue. And ever since then I used my phone with that setting, which to my eye looked more natural (many reported the same experience after the X: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250699527). I changed it back to the default now, and voila, the two screens were identical (but little yellowish to me). With this relevation, I checked the pictures with the low-light condition (on my iPhone with my custom hue setting), and they looked to have less tint than what I experienced initially (and what gave me the shock yesterday). Now, I would say, it's within the range of what I see as Leica JPG engine setting by the Leica engineers, although they still have a slightly different hue than the pictures from my GF3, from yesterday. I then looked at old pictures taken by the GF3 and I noticed that in different low-light conditions (different bulbs, amount of light, etc) it rendered JPGs with very different results (although mostly with way off WB), it's just this one specific room I tried yesterday seems to give me the WB and hue I like more in GF3 than TL2. It seems to be correctable with post-processing since it's not affecting a wide range of scenarios. I tried the Leica with very low but natural light and the results were excellent (again, on the iPhone screen). Conclusion, tl;dr: it seems I was used to the screen hues and tints of my iPhone (with custom setting since the beginning) and old Panasonic so much to feel that the Leica oocs are way off, but in reality they are just a little bit different than what I see as \"reality\", and only in specific artificial light conditions so far. These findings lead me to think that my unit has no physical defects. I will also put the effort to learn more post-processing and give a try to the suggested programs.

BTW, the Summilux 25 is quite an impressive lens on MFT, not to mention the Nocticron. Focus zone control is not a problem at all, presuming you have fast enough lenses. This is why Olympus made a 150mm f/2, a 12-35mm f/2, and Voigtl\u00e4nder makes f/0.95 lenses in 12 (?), 17, 25, 42, and (coming soon) 60ish mm focal lengths. I had both the Summilux-D 25mm f/1.4 ASPH for FourThirds SLR and the later Summilux-DG 25mm f/1.4 ASPH for Micro-FourThirds mounts. Both superb lenses, and amongst my most-used at the time I was in that format. The Nocticron post-dated my time with Micro-FourThirds system, but I recommended it to a good friend who is in love with it. I also had the Macro-Elmarit-DG 45mm f/2.8 ASPH ... a truly superb lens in every way. If I were to invest in more Micro-FourThirds equipment, I'd buy the full complement of Voigtl\u00e4nder f/0.95 lenses ... because they really work beautifully for the format and allow the focus zone control that's needed.

Using it to tone down skies and open shadows can make a difficult image work. This is what Ansel Adams did in analog terms. Once saw a photo of the negative of Moonrise over Hernandez New Mexico and the sky was totally blocked, he had an enlarger with multiple light sources in a grid as well as being a master at dodging and burning.

Many thanks, Jayne, for sharing this. Looks like my copy is headed for the outbound bin. Well I will give it a try.. see what response I get, I had suggested in my e-mail that they looked through this forum and some of the images and discussion, who knows whether or not they do.

However, it looks to me that the ELPRO 52 works great and i could not find any particular problems diopters usually do, soft corners and cromatic abbreation in first. The only one showing the resolution is one of a part of a Swiis Franc bill of very fine printed lines and it show a good resolution. I guess i could get in troubles showing the photo here as it's forbidden to reproduce money bills, so i will not upload it. The main problem is the short focus distance as this creates two challenges a) keeping a life animal calm enough to be able to shoot f/16 and low exposure times only a few inches away fom it b) using a camera mounted strobe there is/may be shadow on the lower part of the photo (what i cropped in the photo) The ring light i have works fine, but due the size the object must be about same level as lens as the ring light will touch the bottom if shooting diagnoally from above. The best would be two wireless strobes, one each side of the lens or a very small diameter ring strobe. Fortunately i am used to do what we Underwater photographers call CFWA Close Focus Wide Angle photography, is didi that also using the Nikon D800 and the Sigma 15mm.

The restriction of posting only Leica Camera photos i cannot post the macro photos with my Panasonic Lumix LX100 underwater or with my D800 on land. On the Lumix LX100 i use a SubSee 10x diopter with very short foyus distance as well while the D800 uses the Nikon 105mm Micro VR However, regarding your question how i shoot live animals so near: one of the best solutions i found and when i took two if my best photos of a mediterrean black widow and tiny snake with the D800 was: depositing the animals in a rectangular ceramic dish like this one, but also white outside as this has two advantages: - the extremy slick surface avoid that the animal can crawl - but fly - out - the glossy and pure white color it create some kind of a soft box effect - i use one Nikon SB800 strobe in wireless mode to illuminate from the side to add a bit of 3D depth Underwater i use two INON Z-240 strobe on double aluminum arms so i can position them wherever i want to have them, here is a similar setup as the one i use--img--  While writing this i realized that i could try to attach the Q2 to the whole strobe stup and use them instead of my Metz. Nowadays in underwater photography we use slave strobes (what was available some years ago as well for land photography) Slave strobes basically means that the strobe get triggered by the camera strobe and has a cell measuring the light bouncing back and adjusting acordingly the time of the strobe's flash. This sounds as a dumb, unreliable solution, but i can guarantee that this works surprisingle very well as the cameras TTL will correct exposure. But this is another story.... However, the common solution for close up macro photography is a ringe strobe as LeicaGuy already suggested. As Leica has no and TTL would not work with any other brand than LEICA there are only two solutions for a ring strobe a) buy the smallest outer diameter ring strobe available and drive it manually, they cam cost from 50$ up to 450 for the Metz ring strobe b) use one of this ring strobe adaptors who use the existing strobe and this would permit to use TTL if you use a LEICA strobe the one linked above is too wide but there are some other products with a smaller diameter. This would be also a nice and not too complicated project to engineer it for a Leica Strobe using a 3D printer Chris P.S. On page one of this tread you can see: a) the snake in the ceramic baking dish and some others on their natural ambient b) my ring light what is too wide diameter and will touch the floor and it's also not strong enough to be the only source of light Excluding very strong video lights, there is no replacement for a strobe as it's light output is much higher than a allways on light If you wonder why i use this McGyver solutions; 98% of my actual life i live either on the Island of Sardinia or in Costa Rica where photo shops are very rare and the existing ones sell only mainstream stuff. So i must buy my things either ordering them online and wait for days/weeks or buy it while i'm back in my hometown in Zurich. I dream of living in NYC where i just can walk over to Adorama or B&H ona buy whatever i need, but honestly, that would be my financial ruin... So often i need to invent McGyver solutions to be able to take a photo for what i cannot wait for days till i receive the needed goods.

This is their 4th monochrome camera over the last 8 years, it is especially interesting as it is the first non-rangefinder camera with a black and white sensor. I think it\u2019s worth starting with a little history of monochrome cameras. Back in the early days of digital capture - Kodak ruled the world with cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars, In 1991 they they introduced the DCS 100 DM3 with a 1.3mp monochrome sensor; this was based on the Nikon F3 camera, and it had a separate DSU (Digital Storage Unit) which went over the photographer\u2019s shoulder (and was extremely heavy). It cost around $25,000. There is a fascinating article about it at Nikonweb (see references at the end of this article). In those days the demosaicing process was not as good as it is now, and that camera produced 2 or 3 times the definition of the normal colour version. Combined sales of the colour and monochrome version was apparently 987 cameras. In 2001 they produced a 6mp black and white sensor behemoth based on the Nikon F5. The Kodak DCS 760M. By now there was competition from Nikon with the D1 and D1x and the price was a slightly more manageable $8000. There is a very good write up of this camera by Pete Myers on Luminous Landscape . Sadly Kodak completely failed to capitalise on their head start in digital imaging, and especially the concept of a monochrome camera. Despite producing the first full frame dSLR in 2002, by 2005 they were out of the professional camera market altogether, the last camera being the DCS Pro SLR/n in 2004 (I had one, it was a fine camera, if a little quirky! But they never shipped the monochrome version). Leica had great success with their M8 and then full frame M9 digital cameras and the idea of making a monochrome version of the M9 seemed a bold and interesting move. I had a test camera in April 2012, and was lucky enough to be at an exciting launch of the M9 Monochrom in November 2012 in Berlin. I still have and use my own M9 Monochrom, it was, and still is a great camera. The 24mp M246 Monochrom was announced on April 30th 2015. The M10-Monochrom on January 17th 2020 with a new 40mp sensor, and now, less than a year later we have the Q2 Monochrom with a 47mp sensor derived from that in the Q2 (and SL2). I only had the Q2 Mono for around 3 weeks for testing last August, Covid 19 meant that I couldn\u2019t do any trips with the camera, but I took the time to look carefully at its performance in comparison with SL2 (which has essentially the same sensor but with a Colour Filter Array). As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my responsibility is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical. I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not told what to write, and although I do show the articles to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. Why a Monochrome Camera? Technical reasons With a colour digital camera the sensor itself can only detect the intensity of light, but it has a colour filter array to allow it to create colour images. The process of converting the image to colour is called demosaicing - This calculates the colour for each pixel based on the colour filter, and the results from the surrounding pixels in groups of 4. The colour filter array reduces the amount of light reaching the pixels by around 1 stop, and the demosaicing process has an effect on the resolution because of the combining of information. With a Monochrome camera, you don\u2019t need the colour filter array, This means that each pixel gets the maximum amount of light thus improving the high ISO characteristics of the camera and the dynamic range. As there is no demosaicing process there is no loss of resolution - each pixel is represented directly in the final image. Of course, there are also downsides: Many of us have become used to converting colour files to monochrome using the channel mixer in our processing software. This, in effect, allows us to apply filters to our images after the event. With a monochrome camera, if you want a red filter, you need to put it on the lens rather than relying on your computer. Another issue is that, despite the higher dynamic range, it\u2019s more important to ensure that you don\u2019t overexpose bright areas. With a colour camera you can usually extract some detail from one of the other colour channels, with a monochrome camera, once it\u2019s blown out there is nothing to recover! This is slightly exacerbated by the higher base ISO of the sensor (usually twice that of an equivalent colour sensor). Photographic reasons Demosaicing techniques have improved over the years, and although there is an obvious improvement in resolution without a colour filter array, it\u2019s not quite as sensational as it was when the M9 Monochrome appeared in 2012. Added to which 47mp resolution should be quite enough for most uses. But having spent a lot of time with all of the Leica Monochrom cameras over the years I\u2019ve come to think that the most important reason for shooting with one is how it changes one\u2019s approach as a photographer. For me at least it makes me think much more about the structure and composition of an image. With the previous M Monochrom cameras, shooting normally with the rangefinder you did still see the subject in colour, the Q2 Mono takes this a step further in that you see the motif in black and white through the viewfinder. You start to think in black and white! Body and Design Leica\u2019s design department have gone from strength to strength making increasingly beautiful and functional cameras, the Q2 Monochrom is no exception, and with its grey and white markings it is indeed handsome. From a functional and operational point of view, with the exception of the obvious lack of White Balance controls, the grey lettering and the changed ISO values, the Monochrom is identical to the standard Q2. The Lens The lens is the same as the Q and Q2: If it isn\u2019t broke - don\u2019t fix it! It\u2019s a wonderful lens, compact and very sharp, it does soften up a bit at the corners, especially at wide aperture, but most of the frame is pin sharp right from f1.7. A simple twist of the lens engages Macro Mode and changes the distance gauge in the most delightful way. Close focus is 30cm in normal and 17cm in Macro mode. Controls The aperture ring is on the lens with the shutter speed on the top plate (just like the Leica M cameras). This makes the camera seem very familiar, Both the Aperture and shutter speed dials have an A position. A on both = Program Mode A on shutter dial = Aperture Priority A on Aperture dial = Shutter Priority A on neither = Manual exposure 3 function buttons can be assigned as needed, and the now familiar Leica rear buttons with Play, Function and Menu are all present. Personally, I would have liked to see a joy stick like the SL and SL2. The Digital Zoom Digital zoom is something of a dirty word in the photography world, probably from the days when small megapixel cameras offered gravelly shots at apparently extended focal length. The Q2 Monochrom is a bit different because the base resolution is so high, and because the implementation is so good, and so consistent with the Leica rangefinder. Implementation of crop mode or digital zoom in other cameras usually involves the EVF / LCD zooming in, with the Q2 Mono, as with the Q2, you can change between 4 focal lengths using the zoom / Lock-button. Choosing a longer focal length simply puts framelines in the display showing what you are going to get. If you shoot JPG files then that is exactly what you do get. If you shoot DNG then the image is not actually cropped. However, if you use Lightroom or Lightroom Classic, then the DNG file appears in cropped form (you can use the crop tool to change or remove the cropping in post processing). The four digital zoom modes are: 28mm 8368 x 5584 47mp . effective aperture f1.7 35mm 6704 x 4472 30mp . effective aperture f2 50mm 4688 x 3128 14.6mp effective aperture f2.8 75mm 3136 x 2096 6.6mp . effective aperture f4.6 \u201cEffective aperture\u201d refers to the depth of field effect\u201d I think this is a great feature, and with the increased resolution of the Q2 Mono it makes the 50mm crop zone perfectly usable and the 75mm okay at a pinch (especially as the lens is so sharp). Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually turn the lens into a different focal length, but the aspect ratio of the resulting image is exactly the same. What you lose is the depth of field relating to the cropped focal length. Basically this will always be the same as that of a 28mm f1.7, so it\u2019s harder to use bokeh to isolate the subject. Due to the big demand for review cameras I don\u2019t have a camera in front of me, but if you want more details then please refer to my original review of the colour Q2. Image comparisons During the test period I didn\u2019t have either an M10 Monochrom, or a Q2, both of which would have made interesting resolution comparisons. However, my old friend and partner in crime Sean Reid is doing a very detailed comparison of these three cameras. More about that later. I thought it was interesting to compare the Q2 Monochrom to three of Leica\u2019s recent high resolution colour cameras, the M10, the M10-R and the SL. Of course the lens used is an issue in that one can\u2019t do a real oranges and oranges comparison. In this case I\u2019ve used the 28 Summilux Asph M for the M10 and M10-r and the SL 24-90 at 28mm on the SL2. Images were all shot as DNG and the colour images were converted to black and white in Adobe Lightroom. For all these tests the camera was set on a sturdy tripod with a 2 second shutter delay. To try and limit focus variances shots were all taken at f5.6. The shutter speed was allowed to vary to ensure that the images were as consistently exposed as possible. Here is a full example of the test scene: --img--  Resolution Of course I\u2019ve shot hundreds of images, but in terms of the resolution I thought it was more sensible to do a resolution test at 200 ISO. I\u2019ve used the centre of the frame (roughly) for the comparison. The M10 and M10-R Images have been upsized in photoshop so that it they are the same size as those from the other two cameras. --img--  In addition to this resolution comparison I did a series of shots of a hedge at about 10 metres at different apertures. Sadly there was some movement in the hedge, and on some of the shots there are obvious signs of blurring. I no longer have the Q2 Mono, so I can\u2019t redo them, but although most of each frame is very sharp, it isn\u2019t all perfect and I think that posting examples might be misleading, added to which they are very boring! However what I found was that the Q2 Monochrome shots had an obvious advantage in the centre at all apertures, with a real magical presence to the files, at f1.7 and f2.8 the Q2 Mono was slightly softer at the corners than either the SL2 or the M10-R. Stopped down a little more the corners were about even, but even at f8 the Q2 Mono still showed an obvious advantage in terms of presence and detail. High ISO Performance Base ISO on the Q2 Monochrom is 200, there is also a pull option of ISO 1oo. For this test I did comparisons at the following ISO values 200 ISO 800 ISO 1600 ISO 3200 ISO 6400 ISO 12,500 ISO 25,000 ISO 50,000 ISO 100,000 ISO (Q2 Monochrome only) I loaded the groups of 4 DNG files directly into photoshop, magnified them to 100% and then taken a screen shot and labelled it. --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  Looking at these comparisons it\u2019s very clear that the Q2 Monochrome has considerable advantage over the other 3 cameras, especially as the ISO value increases and at higher ISO values it\u2019s probably about 1.1/2 stops better. Together with the higher resolution this is obviously going to be a real advantage shooting in very low light. It\u2019s quite remarkable how much detail there is, even in the 100,000 ISO shot, even the banding is very well controlled. An impressive performance. Conclusion Sadly, because of Covid restrictions and the relatively short time I had the camera I didn\u2019t manage do any street photography, and precious little portrait photography either. Hopefully with the results of the Pfizer vaccination test yesterday we will all be on the move again before too long! The Q cameras have been a real success story for Leica and a perfect example of their talent for finding a photographic niche and making it their own. The only real competitor has been the Sony RX1R II with a 35 mm lens, but Sony have not updated this since 2016 (which, with their rapid product cycles sounds like they\u2019ve abandoned it). I have to admit to starting off feeling that in this day of 48mp resolution there wasn\u2019t really a need for a monochrome version of the Q2, but actually I have been quite captivated. The superb high ISO performance is a real bonus shooting in low light and gives one extra flexibility in normal light. The resolution might not be needed, but the look of the files is so wonderfully clean and \u2018present\u2019. I think that this camera is going to be a real hit with street and travel photographers, indeed, anyone who shoots primarily in black and white.

This is their 4th monochrome camera over the last 8 years, it is especially interesting as it is the first non-rangefinder camera with a black and white sensor. I think it\u2019s worth starting with a little history of monochrome cameras. Back in the early days of digital capture - Kodak ruled the world with cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars, In 1991 they they introduced the DCS 100 DM3 with a 1.3mp monochrome sensor; this was based on the Nikon F3 camera, and it had a separate DSU (Digital Storage Unit) which went over the photographer\u2019s shoulder (and was extremely heavy). It cost around $25,000. There is a fascinating article about it at Nikonweb (see references at the end of this article). In those days the demosaicing process was not as good as it is now, and that camera produced 2 or 3 times the definition of the normal colour version. Combined sales of the colour and monochrome version was apparently 987 cameras. In 2001 they produced a 6mp black and white sensor behemoth based on the Nikon F5. The Kodak DCS 760M. By now there was competition from Nikon with the D1 and D1x and the price was a slightly more manageable $8000. There is a very good write up of this camera by Pete Myers on Luminous Landscape . Sadly Kodak completely failed to capitalise on their head start in digital imaging, and especially the concept of a monochrome camera. Despite producing the first full frame dSLR in 2002, by 2005 they were out of the professional camera market altogether, the last camera being the DCS Pro SLR/n in 2004 (I had one, it was a fine camera, if a little quirky! But they never shipped the monochrome version). Leica had great success with their M8 and then full frame M9 digital cameras and the idea of making a monochrome version of the M9 seemed a bold and interesting move. I had a test camera in April 2012, and was lucky enough to be at an exciting launch of the M9 Monochrom in November 2012 in Berlin. I still have and use my own M9 Monochrom, it was, and still is a great camera. The 24mp M246 Monochrom was announced on April 30th 2015. The M10-Monochrom on January 17th 2020 with a new 40mp sensor, and now, less than a year later we have the Q2 Monochrom with a 47mp sensor derived from that in the Q2 (and SL2). I only had the Q2 Mono for around 3 weeks for testing last August, Covid 19 meant that I couldn\u2019t do any trips with the camera, but I took the time to look carefully at its performance in comparison with SL2 (which has essentially the same sensor but with a Colour Filter Array). As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my responsibility is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical. I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not told what to write, and although I do show the articles to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. Why a Monochrome Camera? Technical reasons With a colour digital camera the sensor itself can only detect the intensity of light, but it has a colour filter array to allow it to create colour images. The process of converting the image to colour is called demosaicing - This calculates the colour for each pixel based on the colour filter, and the results from the surrounding pixels in groups of 4. The colour filter array reduces the amount of light reaching the pixels by around 1 stop, and the demosaicing process has an effect on the resolution because of the combining of information. With a Monochrome camera, you don\u2019t need the colour filter array, This means that each pixel gets the maximum amount of light thus improving the high ISO characteristics of the camera and the dynamic range. As there is no demosaicing process there is no loss of resolution - each pixel is represented directly in the final image. Of course, there are also downsides: Many of us have become used to converting colour files to monochrome using the channel mixer in our processing software. This, in effect, allows us to apply filters to our images after the event. With a monochrome camera, if you want a red filter, you need to put it on the lens rather than relying on your computer. Another issue is that, despite the higher dynamic range, it\u2019s more important to ensure that you don\u2019t overexpose bright areas. With a colour camera you can usually extract some detail from one of the other colour channels, with a monochrome camera, once it\u2019s blown out there is nothing to recover! This is slightly exacerbated by the higher base ISO of the sensor (usually twice that of an equivalent colour sensor). Photographic reasons Demosaicing techniques have improved over the years, and although there is an obvious improvement in resolution without a colour filter array, it\u2019s not quite as sensational as it was when the M9 Monochrome appeared in 2012. Added to which 47mp resolution should be quite enough for most uses. But having spent a lot of time with all of the Leica Monochrom cameras over the years I\u2019ve come to think that the most important reason for shooting with one is how it changes one\u2019s approach as a photographer. For me at least it makes me think much more about the structure and composition of an image. With the previous M Monochrom cameras, shooting normally with the rangefinder you did still see the subject in colour, the Q2 Mono takes this a step further in that you see the motif in black and white through the viewfinder. You start to think in black and white! Body and Design Leica\u2019s design department have gone from strength to strength making increasingly beautiful and functional cameras, the Q2 Monochrom is no exception, and with its grey and white markings it is indeed handsome. From a functional and operational point of view, with the exception of the obvious lack of White Balance controls, the grey lettering and the changed ISO values, the Monochrom is identical to the standard Q2. The Lens The lens is the same as the Q and Q2: If it isn\u2019t broke - don\u2019t fix it! It\u2019s a wonderful lens, compact and very sharp, it does soften up a bit at the corners, especially at wide aperture, but most of the frame is pin sharp right from f1.7. A simple twist of the lens engages Macro Mode and changes the distance gauge in the most delightful way. Close focus is 30cm in normal and 17cm in Macro mode. Controls The aperture ring is on the lens with the shutter speed on the top plate (just like the Leica M cameras). This makes the camera seem very familiar, Both the Aperture and shutter speed dials have an A position. A on both = Program Mode A on shutter dial = Aperture Priority A on Aperture dial = Shutter Priority A on neither = Manual exposure 3 function buttons can be assigned as needed, and the now familiar Leica rear buttons with Play, Function and Menu are all present. Personally, I would have liked to see a joy stick like the SL and SL2. The Digital Zoom Digital zoom is something of a dirty word in the photography world, probably from the days when small megapixel cameras offered gravelly shots at apparently extended focal length. The Q2 Monochrom is a bit different because the base resolution is so high, and because the implementation is so good, and so consistent with the Leica rangefinder. Implementation of crop mode or digital zoom in other cameras usually involves the EVF / LCD zooming in, with the Q2 Mono, as with the Q2, you can change between 4 focal lengths using the zoom / Lock-button. Choosing a longer focal length simply puts framelines in the display showing what you are going to get. If you shoot JPG files then that is exactly what you do get. If you shoot DNG then the image is not actually cropped. However, if you use Lightroom or Lightroom Classic, then the DNG file appears in cropped form (you can use the crop tool to change or remove the cropping in post processing). The four digital zoom modes are: 28mm 8368 x 5584 47mp . effective aperture f1.7 35mm 6704 x 4472 30mp . effective aperture f2 50mm 4688 x 3128 14.6mp effective aperture f2.8 75mm 3136 x 2096 6.6mp . effective aperture f4.6 \u201cEffective aperture\u201d refers to the depth of field effect\u201d I think this is a great feature, and with the increased resolution of the Q2 Mono it makes the 50mm crop zone perfectly usable and the 75mm okay at a pinch (especially as the lens is so sharp). Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually turn the lens into a different focal length, but the aspect ratio of the resulting image is exactly the same. What you lose is the depth of field relating to the cropped focal length. Basically this will always be the same as that of a 28mm f1.7, so it\u2019s harder to use bokeh to isolate the subject. Due to the big demand for review cameras I don\u2019t have a camera in front of me, but if you want more details then please refer to my original review of the colour Q2. Image comparisons During the test period I didn\u2019t have either an M10 Monochrom, or a Q2, both of which would have made interesting resolution comparisons. However, my old friend and partner in crime Sean Reid is doing a very detailed comparison of these three cameras. More about that later. I thought it was interesting to compare the Q2 Monochrom to three of Leica\u2019s recent high resolution colour cameras, the M10, the M10-R and the SL. Of course the lens used is an issue in that one can\u2019t do a real oranges and oranges comparison. In this case I\u2019ve used the 28 Summilux Asph M for the M10 and M10-r and the SL 24-90 at 28mm on the SL2. Images were all shot as DNG and the colour images were converted to black and white in Adobe Lightroom. For all these tests the camera was set on a sturdy tripod with a 2 second shutter delay. To try and limit focus variances shots were all taken at f5.6. The shutter speed was allowed to vary to ensure that the images were as consistently exposed as possible. Here is a full example of the test scene: --img--  Resolution Of course I\u2019ve shot hundreds of images, but in terms of the resolution I thought it was more sensible to do a resolution test at 200 ISO. I\u2019ve used the centre of the frame (roughly) for the comparison. The M10 and M10-R Images have been upsized in photoshop so that it they are the same size as those from the other two cameras. --img--  In addition to this resolution comparison I did a series of shots of a hedge at about 10 metres at different apertures. Sadly there was some movement in the hedge, and on some of the shots there are obvious signs of blurring.

On Sunday I was organizing all of my cameras and realized yet again I had a ridiculous amount of equipment. So I boxed up most of it and took it to my Leica dealer to sell it. The plan was to place an order for aQ2, and hang onto just 1 or 2 cameras for a few months until it arrives. So I parted with my M10 and my Leica CL systems. I also got rid of some Fuji bodies and lenses lying around. And in a lucky turn of events, my dealer said he was expecting a Q2 in 2 days that he could sell to me. So I added my beloved Q to the trade-in pile, and went home to wait for the call. And yesterday I was able to pick up my Q2. It feels liberating and freeing to have one* camera choice. I think in many ways I was happiest when I had just gotten a new M9 and I could only afford one lens. There was no anxiety about what camera or lens to take.

I got gas, then I got hit by the side effects. I got too much gear, and now I live in a constant frustration trying to decide which to use when, and of course always regretting. For me, it all started with the search for the perfect camera. I could have been the Canon R5, for example, which on paper is perfect, on a Sony equivalent. Until you try Leica. Which I did. And it messed me up badly. I fell in love with the image the combination of the Leica sensors and lenses. I got an M10R, a few M lenses, and a Q2, next to my newly acquired Sony A7SIII. It took me a lot of time, buying, selling, re buying, to realise the following: -The M is the camera that I use when I want to feel good and look good. It's got style, and it makes you feel like a real photographer. It also produces a sublime image. But at the end of the day, when I really go out to take photos, it doesn't suit my style that well. It's not reactive enough. It makes me miss opportunities, it makes me miss focus (obviously), and it makes me miss the right composition way too often. I could only seriously rely on it for careless photo walks or 10% of what I like to shoot. Landscapes and composites. -The Q2 is my perfect stills camera. Of course its not perfect, but its perfect enough for me. It ticks enough boxes that I could safely shoot 90% of what I like to photograph and have it as my main camera. It has the best IQ of any camera ive ever used. A superb lens, so sharp that it makes me forget about my main focal length (35) and accept to live with a 28. It's good looking, its small, it's AF is fast enough and surely will only get better with time. It's extremely versatile and even has a Macro mode. I enjoy this camera SO SO much. So why this is not enough for me? Because I also like video. 40% of the time, I shoot video. And I don't know when I go out of the house if ill shoot photos of videos, so I need both in one camera. -Takes me to my third camera: The Sony A7SIII. Best video on the market, best AF on the market, excellent stills even with just 12MP, best low light capabilities on the market. I use it with some excellent sony lenses such as the 24GM and the 50 Zeiss. I also adapt my M lenses on it with great results. So this, on paper, is the perfect camera for me (near perfect, I should say, perfect would be with 24MP). Why cant I make it my only system since it offers me everything I need? Well, because it's not a Leica. While the stills are excellent and often can be very closely matched to a Leica, it does not reach the IQ level of the Q2. But more importantly, because it's not inspiring like a Leica. Its not fun to use, it doesn't make you feel good like an M, a Q, or an SL. Of course, ive tried the SL as an alternative to my sony, but while its incredible for stills, it doesn't cut it for video. I think the SL2S will be a better option for me, but it will miss two boxes to become a real contenter to replace my sony: the tilt screen and the bad AF in video. So for now, I will have to give up on my dream to be \"liberated\", like the OP, with only one all rounder camera. I will have to stick with this torture of having the Sony and the Q as my two main cameras.

Has anybody experience this or has advice on how to correct it? Thanks in advance! --img--  Welcome to the forum, Freddy. You have reached the stage, as a photographer, when you are ready to take greater control of the process. Much has been written about the transition and there are videos on line. Try to be selective in those you watch. In parallel, invest time in learning how to get the best out of post-processing. More homework for you, but it will be rewarding and you will become a better photographer.

In the end I went for Camera Leather (cameraleather.com). As far as my concern, CameraLeather.com has the most supported cameras. All my \"vintage\" cameras can find the support. The first one I installed is Rollei 35S (so far this is the only one, I will see how it goes before step into the second), which can only be found in CameraLeather. All others only support Rollei 35, not Rollei 35S. The most helpful from CameraLeather is the owner is very knowledgeable and very welling to give detailed technical guidance. The worst is the Italian named Asian camera case supplier. The price is an order magnitude higher and poor support. Be careful when choosing the material, particularly on the thickness. It matters for the durability, not just how it feels. You want the skin to perfectly matches the camera's side frame. Too thin will expose the side frame and feels incomplete, while too thick might be easy to rub off. Ask the supplier about this. All suppliers sell the whole skin kit, usually it contains at least the front piece and the back piece. But I found installing only the front piece may also make sense. Now I have the two tone skin on my Rollei 35S. The front is the dark red and the back is the original black. I made this decision when I found installing the back piece on Rollei 35s (and Rollei 35) might look insecure due to the hand strap connect construction (not sure if this feeling is real).

I was wondering if you found a solution to your issue and if so, if you wouldn't mind sharing it? Hi @Lentakis, Nope, no solution yet. It seems this has been posted in the wrong forum, since I definitely saw some members talking about these issues in the past, but perhaps they have all moved on to other forums now :( Anyway, for what its worth, perhaps you could describe your camera and problem in more detail and we could compare notes and see if there are any differences that will help us narrow down the issue. To start with, do you only have the stuck shutter problem, or do you also face the shutter button not depressing fully issue? Do you get the LED displays in the viewfinder and does metering work properly with the battery inserted? Lastly, when the shutter gets stuck, are you able to \"knock\" it loose by gently, well, knocking the camera on a pillow or some such thing? I notice also that after I leave the camera alone for a day or two, I can always get 2-3 shutter releases before the shutter gets stuck again. This seems to imply to me that the sticky magnet issue is probably definitely one of my problems. But I am unable to address the fact that the shutter button does not want to depress fully in electronic modes. Since I have no working camera to compare with, I do not know if that is normal behaviour or not. If someone else reads this, it doesn't matter if you don't have an R4, could you check on your R camera and let me know how the shutter is supposed to behave?

First of all, if you enjoy using your R9 for film, and propose to continue so to do, then factor in the cost of a second R9 body on which to mount a DMR. I don't think repeated swapping in use would be a good idea, and personally I wouldn't care for the inconvenience. Secondly, if the DMR goes wrong, then it's a paperweight. Dealers I suspect would only sell on an as is basis - though you should be able to drive a good bargain as a result. I know of a UK dealer who has one in his collection, but can't list it for sale because it can't be serviced. PM me if you would like the name - they may be willing also to sell as is. Thirdly, and very obviously, it's high ISO performance is very limited by today's standards, and it's resolution at 10Mp is also very limited. Fourthly, battery cell replacement needs at least to be considered in the medium to longer term, though replacement is possible (paulmac has details of someone in the UK who can do motor drives, and I'd bet he could do DMR cell replacement).

I avoided the AF failure fiasco (after my Leica 120 spent an unduly long time in the hospital in Germany) by getting the Contax-Leica adapter plus the 55 3/5 and the 80 f2 lenses. Very happy with these two, solid, reliable, really fine glass. Re your initial question, I wouldn't worry too much about the risks. You can minimize the risk of course by buying lenses that are either new (not new old stock!) or have been upgraded with the new AF module (from certified dealers that tell you exactly what you will get). Your S007 adds a bit more mechanical stress on the lenses, mind. I am using an S006, and the 120 now behaves as it should (probably the best portrait lens I've ever owned). i have the planar 80mm f2, 35mm 3.2, 45mm 2.8, 120mm Apo makro, and the 140mm f2.8. All fantastic lenses and shines on the S. But majority of the time I use the 80mm f2 for travel and portraiture. Sadly it\u2019s also the one that hunts like crazy. Maybe it\u2019s the copy I own.

That's not to say that the implementation details haven't changed, but the overall idea is the same. There's a phase-detection sensor at the bottom of the mirror box. That's the same system that every AF SLR has used since the Minolta Maxxum (a system originally invented by Leica). Phase-detect sensors, in a simplified explanation, are two sensors, one focused slightly in front of the image plane, and one slightly behind. The camera looks at the phase difference between the two, and focuses toward the one that is less sharp. It stops focusing when both images are equally sharp. That's what makes it fast, it knows which direction to focus the lens, and it stops when adequate sharpness is achieved. There are a few problems with this approach: it can only focus on one point per sensor, and it is limited in how finely it focuses. In a general way, sensors can be either good at smaller (darker) apertures, or accurate, but not both. When in live-view mode, focus is determined by maximum sharpness/contrast on the sensor. That's essentially the same way you would do it on a view camera with a magnifier. This system is slower, but more accurate. It can also be used at any point in the image. Some sensors have phase-detect elements on board, so they work in live-view. There is no indication that the S3's sensor is of this type. The same caveats apply: limited (though larger) number of focus points, limited accuracy. In addition, the phase-detect elements create \"gaps\" in the image which need to be filled-in, and they create more heat, which can limit DR. Some users also report banding issues with PDAF sensors. Many newer cameras use a hybrid system in live view: they use phase-detect to get \"almost focus,\" and then switch to contrast detect (provided they have the time). Panasonic's DFD system (used in SL, S1, S1R, SL2) uses complex lens mapping to achieve a kind of pseudo-phase-detect. It guesses which way to focus based on known characteristics of the lens. The big picture, which people seem to be missed in these discussions, is that AF system always find something to focus, but they don't know what should be in focus, in order to convey the intended emotional message. That's the photographer's job. I use my own hybrid system with the S: I push on the rear focus button when I need to make a big correction (from near to far, for instance), and then I fine-focus by eye. Tiny changes in focus make big differences in the impact of a photograph, and the odds of a camera and myself being on the same wavelength (wavefront?) are minimal. Often I will take two pictures in quick succession , using different focus points, because they convey completely different emotions.

Often I will take two pictures in quick succession , using different focus points, because they convey completely different emotions. @BernardC that was a great, easy to understand explanation. Thanks! After reading that, I find it interesting to compare how I have always used manual focus SLR lenses (S007, R9, Nikon F2) to focus near and far through the focus plane I want, so that I can tweak it back and forth until the viewfinder seems to show it the sharpest. Of course it's different with every lens because the base aperture is different and lets in different amounts of light to see and focus (f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8). Since I wear glasses, I've always relied on diopter adjustments so I can shoot without glasses, but that introduces yet another variable. What complicates this is that the SL, SL2 seem to have such great focus systems, but they are 100% EVF and no optical VF, which is an incredible experience on the S. I do not shoot fast moving people or objects with the S, so for me, the focusing works well. I could see how other uses might have limitations. I'm a fan of the rear focus button to get me started and manual after that if needed. Not to be off topic, but I also prefer the non-micro prism focusing screens, because the cross in the center is easy to use as a point to focus with the AF system. It may be harder to focus ultimately and if I had my choice, I would love to have a full microprism screen and a full matte screen for manual focusing, similar to the Nikon focusing screen choices I find the small circles are not large enough for my eyes to quickly find the focus, but a full screen let's me compare more quickly and find the sharpest points.

To be clear though, my problem was not with pushing the asthetics, but that literally the files fell apart...getting grainy and having aliasing/tonal issues (literally gaps or peaks in the histogram). Contemporary cameras probably hold up much better to this treatment than most of the ones I used to try doing it with. I use an M Monochrom (original) and make b/w conversions with an M10 and SL2.

They look up to my expectations. The images I took were of people in the street of Manhattan and of urban landscape in early March 2020. I had no chance to continue as they lock everything down and therefore i had no chance to print bigger. one thing though about the Sl2 is that for some subject matter i really like the fast pace capabilities. One funny thing is that I had to go back to the store to disable the screen touch as i was moving the focus point with the tip of my nose while shooting. But the camera is really easy at AF and super fast. i had the 90 and the 24 90 zoom. The ergonomics are great and it seemed after few days that the camera had alway been mine. I need glasses to read so for me it is kind of weird to rely on a screen on the back of the camera if not just for the histogram. For me the less setting i have to set the better. I believe the Sl2 and more the 007 would be a good fit for my habits of avoiding the electronics settings in camera, as i only look for time speed, the f stop, and a correct exposure in every camera. I want to make sure the camera is more reliable and the the previous ones i had and capable to print big landscape images with superb details and colors.

I also have the SL2 and have tried the 50mp Fuji. My job is as an exhibition printer as well as a photographer, so I have a pretty good idea around print quality. I found that the resolution between the S006 and Fuji 50mp is comparable enough not to be a big issue. The difference is more around the lenses. The Fuji 65mm seems to be a bit flatter in field than the S 70mm, so if you are doing landscape work, it might be more reliably sharp across the frame. That said, the 70mm Summarit is lovely for portraits and in no way unsharp, it just has enough field curvature that you need to be at f6.8 or smaller to ensure edge to edge sharpness at infinity in landscape work. The 45mm and 120mm S lenses are absolutely remarkable, and you do not need to think about how you use them...I am exceptionally critical of lenses, and these two have nothing to criticize. The APO Summicron SL lenses are in this boat as well. I have not had enough experience with the Fuji to rate the lenses other than the 65mm, but I have heard great things. At around 100cmX150cm, the S2, 006 and 007 produce around 120dpi if you do not crop substantially. While this may sound low, it presents as very sharp even from close distances, provided that you have maximized your sharpness in taking the photo (especially with the 45 or 120 lenses, using a tripod). The GFX100 will have the resolution edge, but I think there are few usage cases where the file from the S will be unacceptable and the GFX will be acceptable. The GFX has the advantage of the extra resolution and stabilization, the Leica has its own unique look and color properties. In this case, I think the biggest challenges are more regarding how you like to use the camera. If you are coming more from a world of manual cameras and lenses like 4x5, you will likely prefer the simplicity of the S. As a professional, you are probably more likely looking for the camera to step aside and let you make your images, rather than have it sort it out for you. Personally, though I have the SL2 and love it, it is still less joyful for me in use than the S cameras, and particularly less so than something like a Mamiya 7II or 4x5 camera. I miss the directness and simplicity of an optical viewfinder and a clear and basic control interface. While I appreciate the technology of something like the GFX, it is joyless in use. For me, that translates to worse photos. This is something intensely personal, but something which does not often enough get its due. It took me a lot of soul searching to acknowledge that I took better photos with my Hexar AF than I did with a Leica M....for the kind of photography I make with those cameras (candids, travel, family and friends), the AF and simplicity of the Hexar meant that I felt freer than I did with the M. Even though the M is extremely simple technologically, the Hexar was more simple in use, and that freed me to react more quickly and take better pictures. With my bigger work cameras, I find that I take the best pictures with 4x5, followed by the Mamiya, followed by the S. I don't think I have made any photos I would consider great with the SL2, but I have only had it a month or two. Anyway, my advice would be to think more about how you like to photograph than about the specs of the cameras, because I think all of them are more than good enough for any print size, the challenge lies more in how you like to use them.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/310335-leica-s007/?tab=comments#comment-3989087", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "310335-leica-s007", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "hi bitti, i work with the s006, 4x5 and 8x10. i also have the sl2 and have tried the 50mp fuji. my job is as an exhibition printer as well as a photographer, so i have a pretty good idea around print quality. i found that the resolution between the s006 and fuji 50mp is comparable enough not to be a big issue. the difference is more around the lenses. the fuji 65mm seems to be a bit flatter in field than the s 70mm, so if you are doing landscape work, it might be more reliably sharp across the frame. that said, the 70mm summarit is lovely for portraits and in no way unsharp, it just has enough field curvature that you need to be at f6.8 or smaller to ensure edge to edge sharpness at infinity in landscape work. the 45mm and 120mm s lenses are absolutely remarkable, and you do not need to think about how you use them...i am exceptionally critical of lenses, and these two have nothing to criticize. the apo summicron sl lenses are in this boat as well. i have not had enough experience with the fuji to rate the lenses other than the 65mm, but i have heard great things. at around 100cmx150cm, the s2, 006 and 007 produce around 120dpi if you do not crop substantially. while this may sound low, it presents as very sharp even from close distances, provided that you have maximized your sharpness in taking the photo (especially with the 45 or 120 lenses, using a tripod). the gfx100 will have the resolution edge, but i think there are few usage cases where the file from the s will be unacceptable and the gfx will be acceptable. the gfx has the advantage of the extra resolution and stabilization, the leica has its own unique look and color properties. in this case, i think the biggest challenges are more regarding how you like to use the camera. if you are coming more from a world of manual cameras and lenses like 4x5, you will likely prefer the simplicity of the s. as a professional, you are probably more likely looking for the camera to step aside and let you make your images, rather than have it sort it out for you. personally, though i have the sl2 and love it, it is still less joyful for me in use than the s cameras, and particularly less so than something like a mamiya 7ii or 4x5 camera. i miss the directness and simplicity of an optical viewfinder and a clear and basic control interface. while i appreciate the technology of something like the gfx, it is joyless in use. for me, that translates to worse photos. this is something intensely personal, but something which does not often enough get its due. it took me a lot of soul searching to acknowledge that -----> i !!!  took better photos with my hexar af than -----> i !!!  did with a leica m....for the kind of photography -----> i !!!  -----> make !!!  with those cameras (candids, travel, family and friends), the af and simplicity of the hexar meant that -----> i !!!  felt freer than -----> i !!!  did with the m. even though the m is extremely simple technologically, the hexar was more simple in use, and that freed me to react more quickly and take better pictures. with my bigger work cameras, i find that i take the best pictures with 4x5, followed by the mamiya, followed by the s. i don't think i have made any photos i would consider great with the sl2, but i have only had it a month or two. anyway, my advice would be to think more about how you like to photograph than about the specs of the cameras, because i think all of them are more than good enough for any print size, the challenge lies more in how you like to use them.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 26651, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "GoGo", "date": "2020-12-19 02:12:00", "content": "OK then.

The M10-R does most excellent as well but not at the same resolution for the really large print sizes. For my business, most of my landscape photographs are taken in remote areas. Depending on the difficulty of terrain and hiking challenges into an area, sometimes drives the camera system I take for the job. If you need very large and detailed prints, the S3 might be an answer for you. If you print smaller, the M10-R delivers.

Two years ago, I discovered Leica, when I bought a Q-P. For me, it was a shock : what a lens and a shooting experience ! I also started using a M10-P, and again, after some learning curve, I was convinced with this new approach of photography (for me). Always have a small camera with me, instead of leaving my mammoth D850 with holy trinity and primes on a shelf. With my Leicas, I make a lot more pictures (for pleasure) than before. For my professional work (photography is just a part of my work) I began to explore the SL2, and apart some minor problems, I am know in the process to leave my Nikon bodies (already done with Sony, which usability and interface is, in my opinion, a nightmare). For Landscape photography, which includes pano shots, timelapses and \"normal\" pictures, I found a very good tool with the SL2 and the SL lenses (and M adapted on it). From time to time, I rent a PhaseOne XT with 32mm Rodenstock lens. I find this above all else for dynamic range, color rendering and handling, pano shots, frame averaging, ... But to rent is not a solution for me (you cannot plan in advance when the weather offers you beautiful light on a Saturday evening for example). Buying a Phase One is too much in my opinion, and it is not exactly a polyvalent tool which could be easily profitable. That's why I'm now thinking to enter in the S3 world for landscape and timelapse photography, and eventually studio work (people and objects). But I'm not fully convinced and have some questions, and I'm sure your experience could help me in this choice. - Do you think the S line will be developed after the S3 ? I'm wondering this because Leica stayed with old techs on this new body (compact flash card / maestro 2 / video specs for HDMI out / poor and closed flash system) - The Leica \"Pro format\" is not as big as the Phase One sensor. Is the difference in sensor size really significant in the results, compared to the SL2 (noise, lens rendering) ? - What are the differences in rendering between SL and S lenses ? - What are the differences in color rendering between SL2 and S3 ? - Is there a real difference in dynamic range compared to SL2 or Nikon D850 ? - Has anyone some experience in astro photography with S3 (not deep space, just Milky Way shoots for example) ?

The Adobe Color profile in particular seems to be desaturating the shadow detail in the high ISO images. This leads the images to look better at the extremes of ISO. My issue has been that high ISO images look worse than the SL2, despite it being a bigger, lower density sensor, and my low ISO files show banding when shadows are aggressively recovered. I do not mind grain, but dead pixels and banding are problematic. For reference, these are two photos, one from my S3 (left) and one from my SL2 (right).

I use the S-system for work (I'm just a basic freelance photographer), and thus far I've always passed off my bodies to Leica Service here in Ginza, Tokyo to clean the sensors. With the Leica reputation in connection to sensor cover glass, I have not taken any chances. Leica Ginza usually do the job for nothing (quick clean)---anything more involved that'd require a service charge can be written down on my expenses, so I do that and save myself the hassle. All good. {It's also better for me to put the liability more squarely on them, just in-case any sensor cover glass problems did arise: I do not want to eat the Leica after-service tax infamous in these parts---I'm only half joking.} However! Leica Ginza has been effectively shut down since 8th April and doesn't look like going back to normal service anytime soon. My sensors really need a clean, so I'll have to take matters into my own hands. Not scared about it, but I want to get this right in the least number of iterations. Please lend me your expertise m(. .)m I have just tried the Pentax O-ICK1 on my backup S2-P body today. The O-ICK1 (great name) is a kind of dry-clean implement, for anyone unfamiliar. Didn't go well. I had more dust on the sensor after cleaning than before! (I held myself back from doubling down and trying again) So it looks as though that was \u00a53,000 down the tubes. No great shakes, but I'm looking for a different and better way now... I'm in Japan so many of the products available to guys in the West, that turn up on Google searches of this topic, don't seem to be available for me here. I checked older threads and saw a Visible Dust swab made for 30mm sensors (dunno if specifically for the 30x45 Leica Pro Format, but anyway...) which I can't get my hands on in Japan. So I'm looking for workarounds. I've never wet cleaned a sensor myself before, so please forgive my ignorance and beginner questions: 1) Can I just use a full-frame swab? Does the edge of a swab leave a line? Assuming yes, otherwise there would be no market for different sensor size swabs.. or is it all FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) from the sensor cleaning-industrial complex? 2) Can I just wrap a lens cleaning paper on a bit of stiff card or plastic, some isopropyl alcohol on the thin edge, and DIY myself a swab? The one remaining dry-clean solution (that I know of) I haven't tried is a sensor brush, like one of those Arctic Butterfly brushes---how do we feel about those? That specific product is not readily available here, although there seem to be copycat brush products (which surely perform just as well). What is the main thing I am looking for in a sensor brush? (materials, size, etc) I can't say whether the majority of the spots on my sensors are dust or oil, etc., but blowing is not doing the trick so I definitely need to do something more proactive to deal with whatever it is. My two camera bodies are the S typ006 and S2-P, both have had new sensors in them to replace defective gen1 versions, so the cover glass on there is whatever spec the replacement CCDs come with. Any advice and experience welcome. Cheers.

I am also super cautious about Leica Service having read so many stories of guys sending bodies back to the mothership for minor issues, and getting told something else, which was never an issue, was an issue and needing fixing and the cost would be 3x, etc... like a shakedown almost! It seems pretty hit and miss---guys have had the most amazing service experience, for free, other guys get put over a barrel and fisted.

As you say, the chances of me making a mistake and cracking that glass, or fracturing it are small; the chances of using the wrong cleaning solution and damaging the cover-glass coating, though, are a bit higher and worth being cautious about---the downside could be pretty big. I think it's circa 2500 Euro for a new sensor, and given Leica's form, I am sure they would be happy to charge me for it.

(if one of their own techs made the same mistake though, at leica ginza service, then my case for having them pay for a replacement part is much, much stronger, and hence i always had them do it thus far---not because i don't think i can do it, because i don't want to get fleeced any more than i need to be) well, i've rambled on a bit, but suffice to say---thanks a lot for helping me out albireo. i'll give a full frame swab a run and get my sensors ship-shape and bristol fashion! cheers. tom the coating on the sensor filter is no different from coating on a lens or filter. have you ever heard of a lens or filter coating being damaged by any regular cleaning fluid? there is a full post on sensor leaning in the leica m faq. get some full-frame swabs and visible dust cleaning fluid and you'll be fine.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 27843, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "TomLiles", "date": "2020-05-23 12:31:00", "content": "Hi jaapv, Thanks for the reminder that there is info amongst the M content.

Have a good one jaapv. Cheers. Tom The cover glass of sensors is not that fragile at all. There is a (probably true) story of a Leica rep demonstrating this on a DMR. He pulled out a handkerchief, moistened it with his breath and cleaned a DMR sensor, just to demonstrate. The main cause of sensor damage when cleaning is to drag a sharp piece of grit, like a small sand grain, across the sensor. This can be avoided by blowing with a blower bulb before cleaning. I use the Green Clean vacuum cleaner for the purpose when at home. Another cause of grief, I found, is using old fluid in a plastic bottle. The plasticizers can get leached out. I found out the hard way with a five year old bottle of Eclipse. It took me at least ten passes with Isopropyl Alcohol 99% under a surgical microscope to get the gunk off. . Nowadays I rarely wet clean, (using Smear Away by Visible Dust), only to remove the inevitable haze. I use the Eyelead Sensor Stick for Sony. The trick, for peace of mind, is to wobble it when removing, not pull. I find it even removes most of the greasy stuff. At any rate, most sticky dust on sensors is pollen. One hair-raising experience was a rather unique photo opportunity I had observing Wild Dogs in a tropical downpour when I had no sensor cleaning gear with me. I had to wipe the condensation off my CL's sensor using the tail of my T-shirt and Kleenex tissues.

This seems to be happening more as the autos are more 'techie.\" Just a thought. I also wonder if because the S3 does not have an EVF only, that the Maestro II is more than sufficient? I see your point, that it appears that the new Leica technology is all downstream and not necessarily packed in the S3. I'm sure we'll learn more as the S3 gets into peoples hands and they produce with it. I don\u2019t generally like car analogies, but if you force the issue, then I think it\u2019s the opposite in top performance car circles, where the Formula One race vehicles (e.g., Ferrari) incorporate the latest tech, which then trickles down to consumer vehicles. But F1 now has rules against certain tech... so analogies can quickly break down. Analogies aside, I think Leica did as little as possible beyond satisfying the craving, and market \u2018requirement\u2019 for additional MP for the S system. Beyond that, not so much, other than some color tweaks, etc. Seems that the system either morphs to EVF, chugs along with minimal changes, or dies. But I make observations, not predictions... Leica can always surprise...although the S3 was hardly a surprise, basically announced 18 months ago with all key specs.

I find it interesting that some S system photographers appear to forget the history of the camera. The S system saved Leica from oblivion. Dr Kaufmann and senior management realized the company could not compete in a bloated and super competitive DSLR market with fielding the R10. Hence the R10 and R system as a whole was cancelled. The company double downed and bet on creating the S system for professional photographers...not the masses. The S2 ($23K+) when initially fielded was herald by the pros and critics as a futuristic MF camera...ahead of its time. The camera and superior S lenses continue to outperform the competition for resolution, color, aberrations etc. The S cameras are all excellent for their intended design and capability afforded at the time of fielding. The S camera, lenses and photographs that are created are truly a class of its own. I keep reading photographers keep asking for more MPs and lenses for the S. For what end? Leica understands and listens to the pros whom the S system is designed to meet their requirements. All the lenses made to date, exceed most pros requirements. Professionally, if I was to need longer focal length, I can buy a Leica adapter and put a long lens on the S be it Contax or Hasselblad. PC lens...don't need it or want it. All PC corrections I need are fixed using Photoshop or Lightroom. Does the S need more than 64 MPs. Not needed for my corporate clients and private collectors photographs that I create for them. If I needed more, I would go rent/lease a Phase One for a particular job and return it. All the S lenses and now S3 more than meets many pro photographers requirements. So asking and expecting more from Leica for the S, I think one can expect improvements in firmware, perhaps AF and maybe some day a EVF vs OVF. For many pros we continue to ask Leica to keep the OVF vs EVF.

Improved detail rendition for greater image quality The fact that no color filter arrays are required means that there are fewer layers of glass and filter to impede the transmission of light or cause deflections. This is especially advantageous in a traditional rangefinder camera and results in decreased, fine-grained image noise. The M10 Monochrom delivers an exceptionally broad sensitivity range - from ISO 160 to ISO 100,000, while retaining full detail with the finest grain. This enormous sensitivity spectrum enables imagery with an extremely broad dynamic range - yielding results with areas of shadow and illumination clearly defined, particularly when shooting in uneven, high-contrast light. Understated and discreet for low-profile shooting The M10 Monochrom lives in a body technically identical with the M10-P range. The pared-back look and almost inaudible shutter make photographing with the M10 Monochrom a most discreet experience, ideal for capturing authentic moments without drawing attention to yourself. The strict omission of any color-inlaid engravings further emphasizes the camera\u2019s monochrome character.Utilising the full scope of the camera\u2019s capability With its high-resolution image sensor and faithful detail rendition, the Leica M10 Monochrom has significantly raised the bar in terms of camera quality and performance. This, in turn, means that only equally high-capacity lenses will be able to utilise all of the camera\u2019s performance reserves. Leica\u2019s M lenses \u2014 globally recognised as the world\u2019s best full-frame lenses - are the perfect match for the Leica M10 Monochrom, giving rise to an exceptionally high-performance combination.A reliable companion - Made in Germany As with all Leica M cameras, the M10 Monochrom is made almost entirely by hand by experienced specialists in an elaborate construction and assembly process and is robust enough to take on even the toughest of conditions.

I think that there are a lot of probles as people may have different settings in their smart devices. I will leave Friday finally back home to Sardinia/Italy so i don't have time in the next days to make more tests. What i remeber is that the first test i made i left the Q2 sleep without switching her off and geotagging worked flawless. This may be the explanation why this day geotagging was on the correct position as the other tests i switched the Q2 off. Even if the Satellitesymbol lit up after switching the camera on the position is partially wrong, right was always only the first photos after i connected. Under Android it seems to me that it works with the phone \"sleeping\" in my pocket as long the camera is also sleeping and not switched off between shots. Regarding your IPhone, have a look at the settings for Blutooth, Leica Fotos and similar apps who can interfere sending coordinates if the screen is off and phone locked. As long you can transmit music by Blutooth while the IPhone is locked -what makes sense - bluetooth is always on and Leica Fotos should be able access the position.

Your list and your reasoning above fit with what it is said in the Lens Vademecum, which contains massive amounts of information on lens development. It is my bible on early lenses, particularly developments in the 19th and early 20th centuries. I will now look at Kingslake\u2019s book, which is more discursive, to see if it has anything to add. Barnack and Berek did not develop their cameras and lenses in a vacuum and they would have been aware of what was going on around them, particularly in Germany which had a very successful photographic equipment industry involving many different players.

Anyway, I am extending an invitation to you all here to write an in depth article on the Xenon, or perhaps a series of articles for the LHSA Viewfinder.

I'm with Paul (pgk) in saying that this is a story which does not begin with Schneider and end with Leitz. While any magazine article must have boundaries, the story of camera lens development is a continuous one from the 1840s up to the present and, even then, the story begins way before that period. In the Royal Dublin Dublin Society (RDS), where I am a member, we have an original example of the first edition of Newton's Opticks which was published in 1704 and which was the cornerstone of a lot of subsequent optical studies. I recently had a chance to inspect it and found that someone had actually borrowed the book on a library ticket around 1960. Thankfully, the book was returned within the requisite two weeks as the most recent copy of the original edition which sold at auction fetched about $90,000. I have not contacted Jim Lager yet about this specific Xenon topic as the details were coming in very thick and fast over the weekend. I'm also looking around for a topic for a possible LHSA ZOOM meeting hosted from Dublin during the Summer while we are all in full or semi lockdown.

Ok. It seems that for some of us, even when our beloved brand makes a mistake, they don't. Sorry, I cannot agree with it. The 28 mark in the 50 (that I sincerely doubt that all the adapters wrongly marked with \"28\" were done between 1954 and 1957), is a clear mistake. There should be no \"28\" mark on it and from 1971 there should be that \"28mm\" mark in the 90 adapter. The \"21mm\" mark has no reason at all (or do we have here the same reason of \"cleaner finder\"?). The wiki is simply wrong in its 35/50 statement. Not mentioning the 28mm in the 90 adapter is also an error. What's the problem of simply pointing and assuming errors? I'm absolutely amazed. I could make rather a long list of mistakes I think Leica has made! And certainly if you were selling an adapter like this today, it would be misleading to put '28' on an adapter that won't bring up a 28 frameline on the many cameras that have it. But I think this was deliberate back in the day (I doubt they were selling many in the 80s, however they were engraved). Take a look at the IRZOO image. It says 'M3 28-50' (or 'M3 21-50'), but on the other side just 'M2 50'. On the M2, no frameline is fixed, so with any adapter you'll see one of the three (take your pick) but no more. On the M3, with any adapter except the 50, you'll see two framelines, neither correct. So with this camera, the 50 is the least bad option. Anything else is worse than the M2. I have an M6 and the set of three adapters, and if I ever buy a 28mm LTM lens, I'll obviously use the 90 adapter (unless someone can think of a reason why I shouldn't). But if instead I wanted to use that 28 on an M3, I'd use the 50 adapter. Wouldn't you?

Thanks Nigel. It still has not hit 'The Sun on which the Empire never sets', thank God. The idea of putting out this story was and still is to find the families of the people in the photos and to give them some nice black and white prints. Up to the beginning of last week the original story on Macfilos had about 4,000 reads. Then my friend and fellow Leica Society member, Phil Coomes, BBC Picture Editor, put it on the on the BBC website and as of tonight my article has had almost 37,000 reads in its original format . The BBC version had 2 million hits at the end of last week and that has probably reached 4 or 5 million as it has since been in/on The New York Times, The Irish Times, The London Times, The Mail Online, CNN Travel, Swiss, German and Italian newspapers, including Corriere della Sera, Swiss TV and many others. We still have no clear leads, although many suggestions have been made. The story has turned up some interesting issues about 'photographic archaeology', but my goal still remains the same. I might add that it has raised the profile of Leica among many people who may not have previously been familiar with the brand. 21 hours ago, tomtschi said: That picture was surely taken from the Hotel Schweizerhof, and the angle suggests it was just about the height of the Hotel sign.

Getting back to more practical issues, I believe that the triple notice board probably contained maps of Zurich on both sides in the 3 official Swiss languages, German, French and Italian.

Nearly 60 years ago my dad developed black and white film in our basement, and his camera was an inexpensive rangefinder. I remember how much I enjoyed looking through the finder and seeing the world in a different way, but I was too young to understand what made it unique. As our family grew he gave up photography, having to spend time on earning a living to support the family, but I never forgot that camera. Years later I bought a simple Nikon film camera, gradually moving up the model ladder to the F cameras, ultimately owning a F6 and several lenses. While that camera is technically wonderful, it wasn't as much fun or as easy to use as my dad's old rangefinder. I eventually found that I wasn't shooting much at all, and essentially gave up for several years. As retirement neared I started to rethink the camera world and my lack of participation and got a Nikon F5 again. It was a good camera, but film was getting harder to process and find, and the lure of digital firmly grabbed me. I moved to digital cameras, moving up from a D3500 to D5500 (which I still have along with the two common zooms), but as much as I tried to love the cameras I didn't take many more pictures than I did with the F6. The cameras are technical marvels, but overly complicated (at least to me) with menu after menu and lots of non-intuitive steps to get the most out of the camera. The camera also feels \"plasticy\" even though it's built of higher grade materials. Enter Leica - I never owned one but in short order went from a M7 to M9 and M-A, with a 50mm Summicron (digitally coded) and a 35mm Summarit (new design, also coded). Things were far easier to use, but I didn't get the shots I wanted. My eyes have lots of astigmatism, and I also use multi-focal length lenses. The combination makes it hard to get clear focus, even when adjusting the diopter. The biggest change is the lack of clarity, forcing me to preset the depth of field to preset focus and essentially use the camera as a point and shoot. That's not been very rewarding since to be safe I rarely shoot wide open, negating a key feature of Leica glass. In a moment of frustration I sold everything, a move I deeply regret. As the frustration with the D5500 menus continued to stop me from enjoying my camera along with continued inability to get the look I want (Photoshop is not an easy to master program - it's even more frustrating than using the D5500), I found a site hosted by Ming Thein, and I enjoy his approach to photography and \"cinematic\" processing format. That led me to buy a Hasselblad 503CW and I loved looking at the large negatives. I even enrolled in the local community college to learn how to develop and print. That experiment lasted for a few months, but eventually the demand for the darkroom led to long wait times and I again grew frustrated selling the camera - mistake number 2. Eventually I bought a Leica Q titanium from Ken Hansen - a wonderful gentleman who took the time to help educate me. We are all poorer after his passing. While I love the build/quality/feel/etc of the Q the 28mm focal length is very challenging for composition, at least for me. Facial distortion requires getting pretty close to the subject, not an easy task for casual shooting, and making candids especially difficult. Unlike my other mistakes I still have the Q, but I'm not sure what to do now. So, no surprise, I bought a different system - Nikon Z6 with the F4 zoom kit lens. It's a very nice camera, is praised by nearly everyone, and does indeed have the ability to produce great images. Except, again no surprise, I'm back in \"menu-land\" with many buttons able to be programmed and have dual functions. I get even more confused as the capabilities of the modern cameras overwhelm me with learning curves, odd settings and other things that make photography a mental exercise instead of a composition/vision exploration. I went to my local camera store (a very good shop with a knowledgable owner) and asked his opinion. He suggested a SL/SL2, either new or used, allowing for autofocus and the ability to capture anything from grandchildren to landscape. I was tempted, but the lenses are enormous and quite pricey. The system didn't seem to offer much more than the Z6, and I just tried it in the store. He then suggested Fuji X cameras - and I remember having the EX-1 with a kit zoom and a prime, but as much as I liked the size I found the colors a bit odd and the unusual sensor images hard to process in Photoshop. Clearly things have changed, but I never fell in love with the camera, and gave it to my daughter who uses it for her family shots. As I think about what I'd like to shoot it comes down to landscape (more to document where I've been, but I'd like to learn the proper use of filters etc.), people (both family and others), and I prefer candid non-posed images. That leads me to the of lighting (fill flash isn't a strong point on a Leica) and carrying lots of gear. All of this led me to the Q in the first place, but unless I can master the 28mm (actually closer to 24mm) perspective I expect I'll continue to struggle. I'd like to settle into one camera/system. I've shot mostly 35/50mm perspective for most of my life, with the 50 accounting for 75% of all shots (my first instructor insisted that I use a 50 for a year until I learned it well - good advice, but my composition hasn't progressed very much). The Q seems to be the choice, but the 28mm perspective has me struggling to compose and capture what I'd like. The Z6 offers a lot - ability to capture grandchildren in candids, extend my reach with primes/zooms/adaptors, and the 24MP size is fine for my needs. The issue is the \"buttons\" - lots and lots of them and I have spent lots of timing trying to learn them without much success. The D5500 is the obvious \"do it all\" camera, but it's unrewarding to shoot and haptics matter, at least to me. The new M10 is a nice camera, but my vision is not great and the glasses I wear make it even more challenging to get consistent focus. There's also the cost - a full kit would finance a year of college for one grandson. So, the question is: \"What do you suggest I do?\" I want one system, prefer quality and haptics, but also want to capture what I see in my mind with consistent results. Thanks in advance for your collective wisdom - it's much appreciate.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/314747-struggling-to-decide-between-camera-formats-leicanikon/?tab=comments#comment-4072838", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "314747-struggling-to-decide-between-camera-formats-leicanikon", "result": true, "Selector": "i wear make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " greetings -

I shoot M, Q2, SL2, and S007 systems, and now recognize the \"Leica look\" as desirable -- a good photo has it. The flip side is that I see photographs taken with other systems and immediately recognize them as lacking -- the skies are flat, the foliage is either to kitschy or not rich enough, the blur is either not there at all or kinda sad. What's interesting is that such clearly flat, uninteresting photos are accompanying for instance travel writing in the New York Times online. Perhaps they are not optimizing their images for the web? National Geographic is beyond reproach here, they really do stellar work. The most organic and immediate Leica look I see OOC is with the S system, where every shot separates the subject as only the 50 APO does on the M, or the Summicrons do on the SL. But you learn to appreciate, recognize and expect the Leica look across all Leicas. This notably comes up with the X1D system. Although it is wonderful, I immediately notice the lack of the Leica look OOC. OTOH, folks like @Vieri say it is superior for landscape. Vieri shot with the S system and reviewed SL 16-35 before going all in with the X1D and XCD lenses. He can achieve fantastic results in post. I wonder whether the Leica look is our shared set of values, or a niche / camp hobby? Is it something that helps us differentiate or narrows our view?

My guess is that it will never be finished, but that is not a reason for not trying my best. Thank you very much wda, that is very similar to my editing experience too. I have found it quite useful to set up smart collections based on star rating and then rate each picture 1-5 stars. It's the quickest an most efficient procedure I have found and is easy to do as you import. It's really the 5 stars I'm interested in and you feel it as soon as you look at the picture. But I find it easier to then review older photos that I've pre-rated. I also have smart collections set up for camera and lens metadata as I find it sometimes easy to remember which lens I was using when recalling photos. Finding the best is literally like looking for a needle in a haystack. Then of course sorting those into categories and sets is another thing entirely but having a good idea of rating helps I find. It's the reviewing of rejects, 1-2 ratings, that is really quite tedious and as you say you have to be so careful as I have found enough in there that shouldn't have been to be a concern and frustration. That is a great point about offloading the older photos of then younger people. Good idea! It's the historic rediscoveries I fund fascinating. We see things differently as we change and I have photos from 15 years ago that I marked as quite ordinary as now some of my favourites. It makes a very good case for never deleting anything and if you find yourself with time and inclination you can delve into some old 1 star shots and go gold digging which makes for a lovely surprise and gift from the past. Yes I have been through periods of quite obsessively making keywords and those are the easiest to navigate and find. I wish I had of kept it up, I really thought it was wasted time for a while. Presentation really is the tricky part. I think I will go for framed prints for the very best few, some photo books for collections and portability and as they make a nice focussed viewing.

Daytime ambient brightness is a limiting factor however\u2014My impenetrable under-ocean lair is much more controlled and obviously the better suited environment.

I know the Q has a number of 'focal lengths' using a crop method, but something better has to be possible. The real problem for a company like Leica is that it might not survive the loss of lens sales. While I am mainly a fan of older film cameras, it strikes me that the benefits of digital technology have not been fully utilised and that digital cameras still have too many of the features of their film forebears. Digital zoom used to be of very poor quality, but surely the technology has moved on during the past 20 years.

In years past I shot Hasselblad square negatives and printed black and white 8\"x8\" (my standard viewing size) or 16\"x16\" images (rarely used) - cropping wasn't an issue. I used 35mm film as well, but usually defaulted to 4x6 prints to keep the original aspect ratio. At the 35mm size lens resolution and film sensitivity were both somewhat limited, and although I enjoyed using a rangefinder camera, I typically got to see all the resolution that the combination of film/lens quality could provide. On the larger 2.25\" square negatives of medium format images, I didn't even care if I printed the images - the contact prints were spectacular and looking at them was a joy. Choosing between print and slide film was my biggest challenge - do I want the immediacy and portability of film, or the dramatic look of a projected negative? And ever since switching to digital imaging I've been confused. Please help me understand digital resolution versus actual photo resolution, and help me gain a framework (pun intended) as to how to view the digital world compared to the days of film. I own a Lecia Q and Nikon Z6, and for my needs the resolution they offer seems to exceed what I can actually view in an media. Let me try to explain more fully - and I'd appreciate any corrections of my lack of understanding. I typically view images from my digital cameras on a 27\" iMac Retina display - that's the largest high resolution screen I have for any Digital images. From that perspective and pixel peeking with LR/PS I can see differences, but the question is do they matter. That is what I struggle to understand. The issue is that I don't really have the ability to see the full resolution of the images I'm making in camera. The 27\" Retina display is roughly 216 DPI resolution. The greatest resolution screen currently available is the Apple 12 Mini at 476 DPI or the Samsung Galaxy S7 at 577 DPI. These screens are tiny in comparison to the 27\" retina, and so I wonder whether I'll ever be able to capture the full quality of any digital images I make. Furthermore, most Digital screens have calibration issues and color matching is difficult when viewing images on different screens of varying accuracy. I rarely print actual photos, but when I do they tend to be cropped since a 24x36mm sensor doesn't easily transfer to standard photo size prints, and the only standard size print that matches that aspect ratio is a 4X6\" size - hardly large enough to notice fine detail. The closest standard size photo to match my sensor is a 11x16 with an aspect ratio of 1.45:1. So in addition to losing some of my original composition to cropping, I also have to try to match the 300DPI image quality actual printed photos. To print that image at 300 DPI requires a resolution of roughly 16MB. (11\"*300 dpi) * (16\"*300 dpi) = 15.84MB. From that perspective my original Q and Nikon Z6 both seem to be all the resolution I need for the print sizes I will likely make (even if that is a rare event). From my limited understanding I fail to see how higher pixel count sensors result in an actually superior printed image made from a 24x36mm sensor. What am I missing? Adding to these questions the newer medium format sensors are closer to 4.5x6mm format film, not the former square standard of 6mm film. So cropping is required in this format as well, with the closest match likely 11x14. This creates the same misunderstanding of how the Hasselblad/Fuji 33X44 size sensors translate to actual improved printed photos. This seems to create similar issues to using a full frame sensor sized image, with the differences related to cropping a medium format image to a standard size print. So, please help me understand: (1) Given current screen technology, how do I see the full resolution that my sensor is creating (and does this become more limiting for higher resolution sensors); (2) since typical printed photo sizes don't match any full frame or medium format sensor (or for that matter old film negatives) how do you compose knowing that a printed image will force you to crop; (3) how do I resolve these discrepancies when trying to decide upon the ever larger sensor pixel resolution and actual printed photos; (4) - and to me the most important question - Given the increasing difficulty of printing large size photos on real photographic paper, at what point do theoretical improvements in modern digital cameras become unobtainable in real life viewing?", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/315150-help-me-understand-digital-resolutioncropping-versus-actual-photos/?tab=comments#comment-4080883", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "315150-help-me-understand-digital-resolutioncropping-versus-actual-photos", "result": true, "Selector": "i'm making", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " i searched this forum for a discussion of this topic, but haven't found any. if i missed it, please point me in the right direction. thanks to everyone in advance for your comments. in years past i shot hasselblad square negatives and printed black and white 8\"x8\" (my standard viewing size) or 16\"x16\" images (rarely used) - cropping wasn't an issue. i used 35mm film as well, but usually defaulted to 4x6 prints to keep the original aspect ratio. at the 35mm size lens resolution and film sensitivity were both somewhat limited, and although i enjoyed using a rangefinder camera, i typically got to see all the resolution that the combination of film/lens quality could provide. on the larger 2.25\" square negatives of medium format images, i didn't even care if i printed the images - the contact prints were spectacular and looking at them was a joy. choosing between print and slide film was my biggest challenge - do i want the immediacy and portability of film, or the dramatic look of a projected negative? and ever since switching to digital imaging i've been confused. please help me understand digital resolution versus actual photo resolution, and help me gain a framework (pun intended) as to how to view the digital world compared to the days of film. i own a lecia q and nikon z6, and for my needs the resolution they offer seems to exceed what i can actually view in an media. let me try to explain more fully - and i'd appreciate any corrections of my lack of understanding. i typically view images from my digital cameras on a 27\" imac retina display - that's the largest high resolution screen i have for any digital images. from that perspective and pixel peeking with lr/ps i can see differences, but the question is do they matter. that is what i struggle to understand. the issue is that -----> i !!!  don't really have the ability to see the full resolution of the images -----> i !!!

I read through that thread and I'm hoping this new thread will get more attention because I want to make a quick decision. I now use a V600 and Silverfast for 35mm B&W film, so far Ilford HP 5 or FP 4. I turn off unsharp mask, adjust for highlights and blacks, and then export at about 3200 PPI in tiff. I then import into Lightroom, play with the sliders and usually export for the internet at about 2mb. If I want prints I'll send 10mb files to Walgreens. Although I've not done this, if I want analog prints I'd send to a reputable shop. I believe I'm not getting enough detail/resolution so I'm strongly considering a scanner upgrade. I'll either use the V600 for quick review and then run the keepers through the new scanner, or I might give the V600 away to a college or high school. Right now I'm leaning towards an Epson V850 or a Plustek 8200. The Plustek 120 Pro is an option but I'd have to see the how the extra cost is justified. I sent a roll of HP 5 to Ilford USA for developing a month a go because I wanted sharp scans (didn't even ask for prints) and indicated I want large tiff files to work with. They gave 25mb JPEGs that were the grainiest and poorest scans I've ever worked with . I scanned the film with the V600 and got better files to work with. I'm not a fan of spending a lot of time in PP. To me HP 5 shots at box speed (using DDX and using the Massive Development suggested times) should be normally less contrasty than some other 400 ISO films. However, I believe fine detail such as strands of hair should be comparable without a lot PP. Is this a fair assumption? Has anyone A/B'd the V850 or the 8200, and if so do you have a recommendation? Has anyone A/B'd either of the two mentioned with the 120 PRO? If so, is the difference worth the price? If you have suggestions that I should try before ditching the V600 then I'm all ears. Finally, I've considered a darkroom for wet prints but I'd have to do some remodeling in the basement and I'm not crazy about the idea.

If so, would you please provide me some guidance? It's different versions of the Silverfast program that runs each scanner. You have to download the version for each scanner (using the license number that came with the scanner), and then when the Silverfast homepage opens up, you can select in a drop-down menu which scanner you want the software to drive. I run both an Epson V850 and the Plustek Opticfilm 120 Pro on the Silverfast 8 Ai Studio software. Once I downloaded the version for each software, it works flawlessly for me on a Windows 10 machine. One of the criticisms of Silverfast is that they charge you separately for each version of the software, but the appropriate version of Silverfast (actually, the license number) was bundled with the V850 and the Plustek 120 Pro when I bought them.

The deal is that there are two classes of B&W film these days (although \"these days\" date back to the 1980s). High-tech \"engineered grain\" films that produce finer grain and better resolution for the same ISO than the films before 1980. But are also rather high-strung and picky about perfect exposure and processing. These would be the Ilford Delta (Delta-grain) and TMax (T(abular)-grain) films. Without getting too technical, the silver-halide crystals are \"grown\" to be flat and thin, but wide to capture a lot of light with a minimum of silver (tabular) and usually delta-shaped (triangular - \u2206). The flat grains also make the emulsion thinner, for better sharpness (less diffusion of light in the \"Jello.\" (BTW - the delta-shape vanishes in developing the crystals into silver grains. You won't see triangles in the final pictures ) The others (Kodak Tri-X, Ilford HP5+, FP4+, Pan F) use \"old-school\" cubic crystals. Grainier and slightly fuzzier for a given ISO, but with more latitude and tolerance for exposure and development variations. Ilford uses a cute trick with FP4+. As a medium-speed film (ISO125), Ilford makes it with a mix of larger \"ISO 400\" crystals and smaller \"ISO 50\" crystals. Averaging out to ISO 125. This gives it extra latitude in high-contrast situations - the big \"fast\" crystals capture more light and tonal detail in the shadows, while the \"slow\" small crystals keep adding tonal density in bright highlights, where the fast crystals are grossly overexposed and have blocked up. Think of it as \"chemical HDR.\" It is the closest thing still made (at least by the big players) to the old Kodak Verichrome Pan, engineered for box-cameras and P&Ss with minimal exposure controls (shutter speeds and apertures) and thus sloppy exposures in varying light. Very forgiving. Ooops - gotta run. But I would recommend FP4+ as a starting point for someone getting back into B&W film. Excellent background info!

To answer your question explicitly, yes for HP5+ shot ISO400 if you develop with rodinal or id-11 for the recommended times, your results will be almost the same in terms of speed. If you're being pedantic and use a densitometer, you'll probably spot a small difference (a bit extra density in the shadows for id-11) which will be imperceptible with naked eyes. If you plan on pushing those films, you'll get better results in every possible way (grain size, contrast, shadow detail) if you use general purpose or pushing developers, instead of Rodinal. You can still try it with Rodinal though, if you have it already, and see how you like the results yourself.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/308086-visiting-maybe-again-developers-for-bw-film/?tab=comments#comment-3945145", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "308086-visiting-maybe-again-developers-for-bw-film", "result": true, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "51 minutes ago, fatihayoglu said: thanks guys, very detailed answers here. however, i still couldn't get answer to my last 2 questions. let's say i took a picture of exposure chart of 13 shades of grey (plus white to black) by exposing to the same grey area with 2 hp5 rolls ei400. if -----> i !!!  -----> develop !!!  them say one in ilford 11 and the other one in rodinal at 20c for given time on the charts, would -----> i !!!  get more or less similar results in terms of exposure (-----> i !!!  know sharpness, grain, etc depends on the used developer)? also, as i have mentioned i usually shoot these films at ei800 or ei1600, which requires me to develop a bit more, so does it mean i simply move right on the chart and develop accordingly. the reason i am asking these, if i don't understand how the developers work for my shooting conditions, i will never be able to start to develop at home. to answer your question explicitly, yes for hp5+ shot iso400 if you develop with rodinal or id-11 for the recommended times, your results will be almost the same in terms of speed. if you're being pedantic and use a densitometer, you'll probably spot a small difference (a bit extra density in the shadows for id-11) which will be imperceptible with naked eyes. if you plan on pushing those films, you'll get better results in every possible way (grain size, contrast, shadow detail) if you use general purpose or pushing developers, instead of rodinal. you can still try it with rodinal though, if you have it already, and see how you like the results yourself.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 101146, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "mdachs", "date": "2020-04-26 21:08:00", "content": "To proceed the discussion from August, my problem ist not the drying but very often dust, especially bw film.

Compared to user reviews of common Kodak and Ilford B&W films, I feel that the results I get from Montreal's commercial lab (where almost all films are sent by the photo shops) show more grain than I would expect. So I wonder if my films are being processed with the correct developer chemicals and process, as recommended by their manufacturers, or maybe all the B&W films are subjected to a general-purpose developer and process, so the results are not optimal. I understand that grain appearance is all relative and subjective, but I would like to obtain the best results from each film I use. What questions could I ask the lab (assuming I can reach the developer technician) to find out what they do, and how to get optimal results? Or, to try for optimal results, how difficult is it to develop my own B&W films at home? Last month (using a 1933 Leica III, with a 1953 Elmar 5cm in excellent condition) I shot a roll of Ilford HP5 Plus 400 for the first time. To me the grain appears more visible than I expected compared to user reviews of that film. Here is an example picture (reduced to the Forum size limit), centre-cropped about 75%, shot at f5.6 and 1/500 sec. Processing B&W film is easy and fast, and lets you see how the different types of developers affect grain and perception of sharpness. On eBay try to find a Nikor tank for a single 35mm reel - it is the smallest practical tank, and uses only 250 ml to fill. (I can load, process and hang to dry a single roll in about 20 minutes, using only about 2 liters of filtered water for everything including wash.) I'd suggest getting a Hewes 35mm reel, as it is easier to load than the old Nikor and cheaper reels. (I used Nikor for almost 50 years before finding Hewes.) The stainless reels load from the center out (bowing the film slightly to fit between the spirals, hook onto the center and wind outward while your fingers keep a slight bow to the film.) Plastic reels load from the outside in. That's faster to learn, but slower than stainless once you master it. The plastic tanks are much larger, and generally need more liquid to fill. Although I converted my guest bath for darkroom use (with a slip-in blackout panel for the window) I now always use a large changing bag to load film into the tank and process film with the lights on. I only convert to DARK when I want to make a wet print with the enlarger. Wet printing is much more complex than film developing, so I normally scan to computer unless I find an exceptional image. I'm out of practice for wet printing, but was fast and proficient when it was the only choice, and I had a dedicated darkroom set up for printing! Now I guess I'm too lazy. HP5 can be quite grainy depending on developer and technique. If you use Rodinal (very convenient and versatile) the results look sharp, but with emphasized grain. For HP5 Ilford DD-X gives much finer grain and is what I usually use for HP5. Both of these are liquids that you dilute for each use and discard. For fine grain films (PanF is my favorite) I prefer Rodinal with PanF for its tonal range and apparent sharpness. (Better defined grain make the image appear sharper.) I find Ilford films (PanF, FP4, HP5) generally easier to load onto reels and scan than current Kodak, as they lay flatter and feel a bit stiffer. However, Fomapan 100 & 400 lay even flatter for scanning and seem to load easiest. I only discovered Foma in the last year, and now use it most. It's also cheaper for my retirement budget. If you are used to having the lab scan, you'll find it hard to achieve equivalent sharpness with most home scanners, but results should be fine for viewing on computer screens. Like making wet prints with an enlarger, scanning can be an art form to really tweak results, but I'm usually satisfied with the default scans from my Epson 850.

The grain looks within a normal range to me. But could be a bit pronounced due sharpening in the digital process. If he uses a mini-lab-scanner it could be that it is a automated process and he has only rather few possibilities to make changes there, but I don't know. There was a similar discussion in the german forum a while ago where I posted to examples how different TRI-X can look just depending on exposure:https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/235207-rollei-blackbird-was-ist-hier-schiefgelaufen/?do=findComment&comment=2686823 One picture is on the edge of underexposure the other is well exposed. With negative-film underexposure enhances the grain pretty effectively, so don't expose for the highlights like in digital or with slide-film. Depending on the scanner and the scanning software, grain can be also increased strongly with wrong settings. Often it is better to scan without sharpening, but you have to find out. In general I have the impression that scanning B&W films accentuate the grain, while the photographic paper in the classical printing process tend to reduce the grain due to it's slight unsharpness in finest details. But I never proofed this with a test. The developer also has a influence on graininess. As stated T-MAX film could have a much finer grain as the TRI-X with the right developer. But when I use it for example with Rodinal I got a grain nearly as strong as with TRI-X and then I like the TRI-X grain more, because it's sharper. With my fine grain developer T-MAX has tremendous fine grain but only reaches 200 ASA since the highlights get blown if I develop to full speed. There you have to find a good combination. Maybe the most important, the TRI-X of today is not the same as the one in the sixties. When I was a student one of my professors told me that the photographic material has grown worse over the years. Unfortunately I couldn't really proof this because it was not possible to get fresh material from the past, but some experience with old films give me an idea. But a few years ago there was an great exhibition that shows the winers of 50 years of the Deutschen Jugendfotopreis, a competition from juveniles. There it becomes pretty clear: from the 1950ties until 1970 the bw-prints was mostly excellent. No grain, sharp, deep blacks and a great tonality. After 1970 it becomes gray and grainy. And all these pictures was made from pupils that don't have fancy professional stuff, mostly just cheap amateur equipment. So I don't wonder that Jim Marshalls pictures looked much better then today.

I had the advantage of access to institutional, professional darkrooms with the elbow-room for high-end enlargers, drum dryers, drying racks, rotary washing tanks and so on. And relative \"clean-room\" conditions - although I still went through several quarts/litres of stuff like this over the years, spotting every individual wet-print (the #000 brushes also needed replacing every couple of months or so): https://www.freestylephoto.biz/category/58-Photo-Artistry/Spotting Once I moved into graphic design and editing, and did not want to invade the busy space of the newspaper photographers, I had to start building my own darkrooms in apartment bathrooms. Worked fine for the \"wet\" stage (once I designed a quick-assembly/quick-breakdown wooden table for the trays, that fit onto a standard bathtub's corners, and another table that would fit over a standard sink/toilet to make another flat workspace for the enlarger). But no space for controlled drying - had to give up using fiber paper. Never could print larger than 11 x 14. But even then, wet-printing was a PITA.

I have been successful a few times using a C41 kit to develop 6 rolls of 35mm Color and B&W film. The Procedure for C41, I gleaned from a website was as follows: Pre-Soak, Developer, Blix, Wash, Stabilizer, Wash. Another Sequence I read about said: Develop, Bleach, Wash, Fix, Wash, Stabilizer, (and I assume a Wash although not mentioned, w/wo Pre-soak as per the most excellent recent topic in \"Film\".) So I seem to have read that Bleach+Fix = Blix, (and another myriad of comments which is the best combination for stopping and fixing.) So if e.g. Bleach is used, is it the one we use in our washing machine, or something very special to Film development?? and at what dilution if any etc.??? and then what is used as \"the Fix\"??? I can understand (maybe I assume) that the developer is proprietary to the film used, but what about the \"Fixer and Stabilizer? Starting out one would like to keep it simple! I tried that by picking all C41 film (Color as well as B&W) such that I only need one set of chemicals.

Building on what I learned from the first pack, I: - Printed photographs of people, landscape and nature, avoiding buildings and manmade objects. - Looked at how well borderless printing works. - Looked at how well the thin papers stood up to dense coloured images (lots of ink), as well as sparse images with lots of light background. - Printed on both sides of the Inbe Thin paper; although not marked on the pack as suitable for double sided, I'd seen remarks online that the Inbe paper was designed for double sided. Further conclusions: - Borderless printing presented no problems (I didn't expect any, but worth checking). - The Murakumo Kozo Select thin papers held ink well (dark blue image of man in the centre, and B&W girl singing top right corner) showed the image on the reverse, but with little obvious lateral seepage. The Kozo Thin papers showed even less (landscape with two rocky islands, centre left, two dancing couples, top centre). - The Inbe Thin White, which I printed double sided with dense coloured images (girl in the red jacket, centre right) showed no obvious sign of the images on the respective reverses. Common sense says this needs further examination, but if it remains the case, then this looks like a good paper for photobooks. - The double layered papers remain challenging, both to peel and mount. My experience from the first batch was repeated: the Mitsumata White Double Layered (landscape of Helvellyn, bottom left) was fairly easy to separate with care. The Kozo Double Layered is tricky and easy to tear as you start to peel, and remains curled (lovers in dark red, bottom right). I understand these papers are designed to be made into Japanese hanging scrolls. - I tried two different image types with the Unryu paper (the one with the waferboard-like surface texture). A borderless print of a wildflower garden (top right): the paper pattern was lost entirely; I can see no benefit to this paper for such an all-over image. The clunky vignette of pink plants (lower left): the paper adds something here because the texture is visible in the un-inked or light colour parts. This is not really the sort of photography I do, but I can see a benefit to the paper here. - Generalising from the foregoing conclusion, all these papers show themselves at their best where the texture of the paper can be seen. I would be inclined to print dense colour images with a large border, or use these papers for images where there are plenty of light areas. - I don't think I have examined B&W landscapes particularly well here, though I included several (all given a similar high key, high contrast treatment). It's not a type of photography I do much of and I doubt that I am particularly good at processing them for printing on western paper, let alone these Japanese papers. So will I buy some more? Probably! I want to make some photobooks, so the Inbe Thin papers are attractive. The Bizan (handmade) papers are stunning, and expensive. They would make great presents, for holding.

I have recently bought Canon's own inks because I was very dissatisfied with the results with the inks from 123inkt.nl. They are generally fine for non-critical results, but there is a bit of solarisation on the prints plus the colours are not as accurate as the Canon inks. I did consider inks from Precision Color (https://precisioncolors.com/Pro1000.html) but they are quite frank in saying that they have not been able to reproduce the blue, yellow and red inks and the chroma optimiser. As tempting as it may feel to get a lot more ink for a lot less, for me (I hasten to add), it is not worth it in the long run. So over the last several weeks I've been doing my best to empty the printer by printing and printing and printing and printing. I say that because even though the printer says that the inks are empty, and has said so for a long while, they are not. It has to do, I believe, with the fact that the printer uses internal tanks into which the ink is pushed from the cartridges and this reserve will also need to be emptied. Once the printer is as empty as it can be I will install the Canon inks. Unless Precision or another non-OEM ink maker comes up with proper replacements for all cartridges I will stick with with Canon's.

Mine was a Blurb project and, on the whole, it is an impressive-looking volume; circa 120 pages, 13\" x 11\" hard-back with dust-jacket and printed with all the top options available selected. There are, however, two very distinct and very noticeable, fatal flaws. The first is that despite 95% of the photographs (one per page) being rendered as pure monochrome files (the others were duotone / tri-tone / quad-tone) the 4-colour process used for the book has resulted in a gently and randomly variegated tri-tone effect where ALL black and white images are seen, in different areas, in different - quite subtle - tints and tones of magenta, cyan and black. The effect isn't wholly unpleasant - in some cases it adds a....well; shall we say different?...character to the image as originally imagined. NOT what was asked nor expected, though, and I'd rather my b'n'w images were printed B'n'W thank you very much. The second is altogether more weird and far harder to describe but I'll give it a go; on certain areas of a number of images there is a shadow - a 'ghost' - of another image sort-of superimposed on the first. Think about it like this; You are in a darkroom making a traditional wet-print. You expose your sheet of paper in a printing-frame at the base of an enlarger normally with the image captured in negative #1. Then, before you develop the paper, you put the exposed in another printing-frame at another enlarger and give it perhaps 2% exposure-time with image/negative #2. You then dev/stop/fix/wash/dry print and find the very slight double-exposure from the second neg all-but-invisible but, at the same time, THERE all the same. I've been trying to work out how this situation could possibly arise. All I can come up with off the top of my head is that somehow there is a situation arising where a printed page stacked on top of another printed page under a strong light-source is acting as a 'negative' and the paper directly underneath is behaving in some weird sort-of 'printing-out-paper' manner. Just to be absolutely clear; the 'ghost' image is never reversed so there isn't any issue with possible face-to-face (paper) ink print-off situation happening. The 'ghost' image is always seen as a negative in that light is dark and dark is light. The two images concerned are almost always either next to each other in the page-numbering sequence or, at most, one more page apart. HAVING SAID ALL THAT; the book itself is quite impressive and the feeling is of a high-quality product.

I am trying to refine my haphazard workflow now that I have a nice new Q2. I\u2019ve decided to ditch Lightroom because I never got on with it, having previously used Aperture for years. I\u2019ve been using Luminar 4 for a few months but am trialling Capture One at the moment and it looks likely that I\u2019ll move over to C1 when my trial is over. The question I\u2019m wrestling with is whether to bother keeping my raw/DNG files or to refine a workflow focused on the \u201cfinal\u201d jpeg/tiff. The context is that I\u2019m a purely hobbyist photographer and a pretty poor one at that. I\u2019ve been taking photographs on and off since the late 1970s but more regularly since 2003-ish. My digital archive currently consists of around 2000 files - I delete most of what I take because it isn\u2019t very good and about half of my archive only survives because it has sentimental value rather than artistic merit. Same with film - I take much less film-based images these days but most gets dumped immediately and I probably have a third-full A4 binder with 35mm and medium format slide and negs: if I lost that tomorrow it wouldn\u2019t bother me because they aren\u2019t very good. That might sound depressing but isn\u2019t meant to - I\u2019m always trying to up my game! Over half of my photographs are black and white, so I process the few DNG that make it past initial deletion. Sometimes, I have left it at that, sometimes I have created a final jpeg/tiff version that bakes in the changes. I\u2019m just wondering whether to always do that, produce a tiff version and delete everything else, including the original DNG and rely on whatever software I use (eg C1) any small jpegs I might need in the future.

Ideally (if exists), I would like to invest in a printer that would last for years, with the following characteristics: - The best possible image quality (also In terms of durability), as I am planning to sell prints - Mostly, I would use the print to print a relatively high number of photos in smaller format, for review purposes, but still the highest quality possible - Within an budget of about 1200 GBP (of course, I would like to spend much less) I have a few basic questions: Would a printer like Epsom SC-P800 support papers like HP Premium Satin? The fact that the SC-P800 is an A2 printer means that it can easily print any smaller format, right? Many thanks in advance! Take a look at the Fotospeed website for your SC-P800 printer. I use Fotospeed Inkflow inks and Fotospeed papers, currently Platinum Etching 285 for colour and black and white prints, Platinum Baryta 300 for colour prints and Legacy Gloss 325 for back and white prints. There are many more papers in the range and the best way to decide for yourself is to experiment with their sample packs. Fotospeed Inkflow employs refillable cartridges and it is much cheaper to feed your printer this way than using genuine Epson inks (this is where all printer manufacturers make their money). Fotospeed will provide you with FREE CUSTOM PROFILES with their inks and papers. Simply download the profiling pack from the Fotospeed website, print the chart and send it to Fotospeed who will email your custom profile(s) back to you. From my experience custom profiles are returned within 48 hours. They will also provide you with custom profiles for non-Fotospeed inks and papers but there is a cost for this. Also take a look at the Marrutt website for your SC-P800 and their Continuous Ink System and refillable cartridges. Excellent support and their papers and inksets are probably just as good as Fotospeed. I was for several years a beta-tester for Epson's ProPortrait printing system (as the 1st UK PropPortrait installation) which was only available to professional photographers. My experience is that you will see no difference in print quality between Fotospeed Inkflow and genuine Epson inks. Many of my professional colleagues also use Fotospeed Inks and papers. I would urge you to take a close look at Fotospeed Inflow before buying a SC-P800. Disclaimer: I have no connection with Fotospeed other than being a very satisfied customer with their products, service and support. Whichever way you go, good luck and well-done on deciding to print your work!

Just a thought: now that you have ordered a P800, it might be prudent to stick with Epson inks and papers to protect your warranty whilst you find your feet rather than go straight into CIS or refillable cartridges from a third party supplier such as Fotospeed or Marrutt, which will likely void your warranty if you subsequently have problems with the printer. Personally, from long experience I would always buy the printer together with CIS or refillables from the same ink system supplier, where the supplier will provide their own warranty. Buying a new printer from one source may well be a false economy if you load it with third party inks from another source and run into problems from the outset. That said, you can always consider using third party inks when your printer warranty expires.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/305250-recommendations-for-printer/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3951005", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "305250-recommendations-for-printer", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "3 hours ago, deckard said: ok, i got a few more questions. i appreciate that there is a lot here, so maybe if anybody has a link to any website with comprehensive info on the printing workflow , i would appreciate (by the way, i went for and epson sc-p800) monitor i currently work on a 2012 macbook air. the monitor is 15.4 inches 2880 x 1800. i feel very happy with it, so the question is: would this be enough to get good prints (i hope so) or do i really need a better monitor?

So here are the unadjusted RAW and adjusted JPEG files. Neither can illustrate '' because light and colour reality at 27m depth are both low (1s at f/14 handheld + flash is as far as I could go) and there are only reds due to the flash. The exposure is at the high side, but all highlights are retained, because of the background which would otherwise be absolute black and whilst I can pull back the highlights, noise kicks in in the shadows if they are brightened too much. For anyone who doesn't scuba dive in murky, dark, cold (12C) water, then it may not also be apparent that decision making is marginally blurring at this depth and there is a very finite limit on the time available so precision is not always as easy as above water. But I digress. Sony A7II with 20/1.8 FE lens. Its primarily a scientific shot and the adjusted shows how I intended the image to look. --img--  --img--  Your usual superb standard, Paul. I suppose the question about which actually represents reality is answered by what you saw when you were there yourself. However that was the reality you saw and which you attempted to capture. If I was there (unlikely!) I might see a different 'reality'. No camera or film that I have used can capture exactly the 'reality' that I can see. When I take a photo I often make a little mental note to self along the lines of 'I know what I will do with that one'. It is all a bit circular really, but it reflects what what the photographer wants to see and show. As for technical points about the output abilities of different cameras and films I usually don't pay them much attention once I am in a shooting situation.

Long ago I selected Adobe Lightroom to manage my photos - bought the software, and it was mine to use, until I bought an even newer version of Lightroom. Lightroom allowed me to move my images into a logical location on my computer, keep track of images, so I could find them in the future, and edit the images. My thoughts on this changed when adobe went to a subscription mode, so I would be paying a monthly fee to adobe from then on, forever. I'm still paying, but I want to eventually get out. Early this year, I bought my Leica M10, and created a new file storage location on my computer. I wasn't sure what program I would use for editing, but after trying several, I settled on PhotoLab 3, which recently became PhotoLab 4. PhotoLab is an image editor. It doesn't replace the full Lightroom system including where and how to store images. I create folders where I want, and copy my new photos there using my own organization system so I can find them later. I followed the same format for photo organization as I have been using in Lightroom, separating images by country, then by the year they were taken, then by the location/purpose for the photos. This has worked for me over all these years in Lightroom, and I replicated it with a brand new top level folder for PhotoLab IMAGE TRANSFER: How the images got from my memory card onto the computer was and still is handled by one of my favorite programs, Photo Mechanic. Photo Mechanic \"ingests\" the images from the card, and quickly allows me to delete the junk images should I wish to. It is very fast, even with hundreds of RAW images. It can rename the images as they are ingested into something more useful than the ordinary file name, and it allows me to add lots of information to the \"metadata\", doing all this to every image as it is ingested. After image review, until this year, I would then use Lightrooom's \"Import\" tools to get these images into my Lightroom System. For other editors, such as Luminar or PhotoLab, I can move the images into an appropriate folder, in a location where I hope to be able to find those images years from now. NEW: Camera Bits, the company that provides PhotoMechanic, has now released PhotoMechanic Plus - which combines the previous software with a new DAM system (Digital Asset Management). This does what Lightroom used to do for me, and goes far beyond it. From what I've read, I will easily be able to find my photos based on many criteria. Since I'm new at this, and am still learning, instead of describing it in my words, I'll just post this link: https://home.camerabits.com/tour-photo-mechanic-plus/ People have told me that my photo organization is essentially the same as what my parents and grandparents did, placing photos in a shoe box with a label. At first I laughed, but not any more. My life seems to have changed so much now - taking photos with the Leica, editing them in my new software, and using the DAM function to allow me to find my images in the future - and all of it I \"own\" (well, the license, not the software), no need to make any monthly payments so that it can/will continue. Having said all that, how do the rest of you deal with this?

Early on, I auditioned Capture One. at the time it was clear that it was geared for studio shooting and had no DAM component so I gave up on it. I tried apple's pro photo software and found that also wanting. I settled on Lightroom primarily because I needed to be able to organize and retrieve the thousands of images I was creating as an architectural photographer and also for my personal work. I give Adobe a lot of credit for understanding very early on that we creatives are a messy, unorganized bunch that need all the help they can get in an easy and intuitive way. I grew up shooting slide film so have always been very good at getting the exposure right in camera. so my primary need was organizational, that being said, I have only shot raw since my first digital SLR, the canon Eos 2oD so the raw conversion has and still is a very important factor for me. I have stuck with Lightroom all these years because it gets me as a photographer, - from organizing to raw conversion to printing.

I have a monitor that has a hardware setting for sRGB and I find this very accurate. I don't change the setting when the room lighting changes. But the monitor is unusual as it is a flat CRT, originally supplied with a high-end unix workstation. The iMac screen has a calibration tool in \"settings\" and to view images I set brightness for 100% but if I did not have the CRT monitor I would likely look into profiling the screen with a hardware dongle. I would not adjust the monitor according the image I am viewing as the monitor is the reference. I can't really comment on settings in the current version of Lightroom as I only have the \"perpetual license\" version which is quite good for cataloguing and searching for images but for raw processing I much prefer Capture One. As mentioned elsewhere, it can be useful to do \"Auto Adjust\" (\"auto-tone\" in LR) to see what the software comes up with and this might give a starting point, otherwise reset to original and work from there. A quick web search reveals a number of sites where the C1 workflow is described (often in contrast with LR) so there is more than one way to approach it. \"Less is more\" is a very useful rule of thumb. Viewing the result of adjustments on a well-calibrated monitor while paying close attention to the histogram is essential. Unless you are looking for a special effect, the aim is for the histogram to extend across the full range from black to white with a solid middle (where much of the detail is found). C1 does not distinguish between \"library\" and develop, using tabs to choose each option. LR obviously needs to be in \"develop\" mode to do processing other than the \"quick develop\" in library mode. As I said in the original post, the most important thing is to come up with a workflow that is consistent, reliable and repeatable. Many tools interact with each other so getting them into the right order is also important.

 -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  and this might give a starting point, otherwise reset to original and work from there. a quick web search reveals a number of sites where the c1 workflow is described (often in contrast with lr) so there is more than one way to approach it. \"less is more\" is a very useful rule of thumb. viewing the result of adjustments on a well-calibrated monitor while paying close attention to the histogram is essential. unless you are looking for a special effect, the aim is for the histogram to extend across the full range from black to white with a solid middle (where much of the detail is found). c1 does not distinguish between \"library\" and develop, using tabs to choose each option. lr obviously needs to be in \"develop\" mode to do processing other than the \"quick develop\" in library mode. as i said in the original post, the most important thing is to come up with a workflow that is consistent, reliable and repeatable. many tools interact with each other so getting them into the right order is also important. my workflow in c1 goes like this (work through the same sequence each time): - styles and presets (the develop menu in lr has something similar) if there is something you prepared earlier - lens module - color module - exposure module (this is the module where the most dramatic adjustments are made and care needs to be take not to \"over do\" it) -- start with \"exposure\" to get a good histogram -- i find \"highlight\", \"shadow\", \"white\" and \"black\" much more useful than \"brightness\" and \"contrast\" c1 has a \"details\" module where sharpening, noise reduction film grain, spot removal are found, not sure about the lr equivalents -- sharpening and noise reduction best left at zero unless there is something about the original raw file (eg exposed at high iso) that needs work -- modern cameras with little or no anti-aliasing filters on the sensor don't need sharpening in my experience and film scans can become very grainy if sharpening (as opposed to clarity) is over-used -- spot removal can be very useful if there was dust on the sensor or spots on a film scan -- \"clarity\" in my experience works much better than \"sharpening\" - output (in c1) - lr uses \"export\" this is the place to decide whether to produce a tiff file (e.g. for use in another program such as photoshop or dxo nik collection) or a jpeg (for web, e-mail etc). - print -- the most important thing here is to have good color management as \"managed by printer\" is rarely sufficient hence a bespoke profile for your combination of printer, paper, ink", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 111073, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "250swb", "date": "2020-09-17 21:26:00", "content": "Maybe this idea isn't complicated enough given the knots people are tying themselves in, but within Nik Suite's 'Color Efex' range of effects it can do all sorts of weird things to colour and make an image look orange.

The whole kit should go together easily (I found the thread on my copy stand needed an extra washer or it bottomed out in the camera, alternatively replace the top with a tripod head). An app on your iPhone to level the camera is ideal. Then you need a negative holder, often you can find something from an old scanner on eBay. Additionally you will need some software because neither Photoshop or Lightroom can 'invert' a colour negative or B&W image correctly. I refuse to use Lightroom and so Negative Lab Pro is out, so I use ColorPerfect in Photoshop, but enduring Lightroom for back-to-back tests I found the real world output is very similar.

From the other thread you started (also in this 240/262 forum): I would skip the 262 for lack of live view (even if you do not care about EVF or film). Really great to be able to turn it on the the times you really need it. Of the cameras you list above, I would go for the M-P version. It is the best of all worlds of all the cameras in this generation. I love the 100% increased 2GB buffer (makes a big difference when you take several pictures, even if no M cameras are speed monsters) also the red fram line option (really great when I shoot in the dark and do not want to destroy my night vision), which I just now learned from another thread, is unfortunately no option in the 262.

Digital Monochrom gets very clean - digital if you like, files at low ISO and it has the ability to shoot cleaner than film at high ISO with obvious high ISO noise which looks like a film grain - more or less. I like film photography as is, only reason i don't use it as i used to is cost and convenience of digital, plus i didn't have M246 all that long in my photographic life. The M246 needs to pay for itself and shooting and processing rolls of B&W film is not going to do it for me*, home freezer would probably disagree with me. The new M10M brings some advances over the predecessors but for a second i don't doubt that both M9M and M246 have a lot to go for. *Note. After 4 years i shot equivalent of 250 rolls of film, at \u00a320/film, processed and professionally scanned i broke even, I paid \u00a35K for a brand new M246 in January 2016. Leica would love me if I bought new camera but I am not sure what a 50% more expensive camera can do for me. Each person has their own tastes, I know a lot prefer high contrast / clean files, but for me the greatest benefit of the MM1 is to be able to make files look as closely as possible to the results I got from Tri-X / Ilford...something that I feel I have never been able to achieve with color digital images, and that\u2019s why I still shoot color on film. Digital does have a lot of benefits (including cost in the long term as film becomes more and more expensive) that film doesn\u2019t, but to me the most important thing in the end is getting an output I\u2019m happy with. With color, unfortunately no sensor gets close to recreating the film output and colors (M9 came the closest), but for B&W, the MM1 comes so close that I see no point for me in shooting B&W film. I still think film is better if you do your own development / scanning / printing, and enjoy the whole process, something that digital can\u2019t offer...but given that I don\u2019t develop / scan my rolls and send it to a camera shop, I do prefer to shoot B&W on digital if I have the chance given I have more control on the final image, and for me what I try to do with my editing is get close to results I get on film, including adding significant grain So I was just wondering if people who used the M10M, also tried the M9M and see any differences in the output at base ISO; from what I understand a lot of people who tried the 2nd iteration of the MM went back to the M9M as they didn\u2019t enjoy the output from the typ246...", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/305409-jono-slack-leica-m10-monochrom-field-report/page/6/?tab=comments#comment-3895388", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "305409-jono-slack-leica-m10-monochrom-field-report", "result": false, "Selector": "i don\u2019t develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i still think -----> film !!!  is better if you do your own development / scanning / printing, and enjoy the whole process, something that digital can\u2019t offer...but given that i don\u2019t develop / scan my rolls and send it to a camera shop, i do prefer to shoot b&w on digital if i have the chance given i have more control on the final image, and for me what i try to do with my editing is get close to results i get on -----> film !!! , including adding significant grain so i was just wondering if people who used the m10m, also tried the m9m and see any differences in the output at base iso; from what i understand a lot of people who tried the 2nd iteration of the mm went back to the m9m as they didn\u2019t enjoy the output from the typ246...", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 25478, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "setuporg", "date": "2020-04-19 01:50:00", "content": " So it's interesting how life works. I got my M246 and film M-P at the end of 2018, and used them sporadically into the first half of 2019. Now with the M10M announcement, I had not much interest originally. I've acquired a full Leica S system late in 2019 and had enough things to play with and compare, such as S 007 to X1Dii. However, something about sheltering in place caused me to pick up the M246, and I've made thousands of shots with it in March and April, and also dozens of B&W videos. I even got the Leica Mikrophon adapter for M246, to record stereo. And after reading many reviews, I'm getting the M10M, hopefully next week. I'm not letting the M246 go as the B+W video might never come back and it's the only rangefinder with video I got (Edition 60 eschewed it). I can also compare them and do two-body, two-lens shooting. I'm usually carrying a color M, M60 or M10, when I take the M246 with me, so now it would be three Ms, no big deal compared to say S with an X1D and a few of their lenses.

Maybe a demo M240 as a straight trade with NO money involved. My M-E 220 was purchased new in Moscow (autumn 2016) and went for new sensor in 2018 via Downtown Camera in Toronto. With Canon RP purchased just recently, my M-E 220 is last digital Leica I have purchased for practical reason. I might get another digital Leica, but strictly for feel good reason. Like buying Mazda Miata (except parts are still available) in addition to daily driven car. I'm keeping M4-2 which needs at least 500 USD for parts and service to work flawlessly again.

Not only are the issues with the M8 and 9 annoying for their owners but these issues deter people from buying an M. I would not hesitate to buy an 18MP M9 if I could see it as a camera that one could expect to use for another troublefree 5 years or more. Instead one can expect to buy a lot of problems. So I use my M lenses on Fuji Xpro's, sad. Call me frugal but for the price of even a secondhand M I like to expect years of trouble free use. Even if users decide to bin their Leica because of digital rot after a couple of years, the factory should make them to last. That is why it is a Leica. Unfortunately Leica themselves appear to underline the 'disposability' of their cameras by ending the free replacement of te affected M9 sensors. If you stand behind your product and you messed up, you should replace the sub standard parts, even after 10 years. Funny that the beautiful 60 year old rangefinder design in an M9 will still work after 30 years while the camera is useless. Maybe Leica should make modular M cameras, where the user can replace the sensor and engine module. And maybe this is the best they can do to survive in a market where cameras became expensive disposables. I am happy I decided to keep my film Rolleiflexes, Hasselblads, etc. If you google enough you will find DIY instructions for how to place FF Sony A7 sensor into film M. Current state of electronics and 3D printing allows to do it. But I'm waiting for Leica made retrofit kit to install global shutter into film M.

An A7 sensor and better, an original retrofit kit sounds interesting. I am an amateur photographer, so I have the luxury of not having to deliver. Having said that, I don't like to spend hours on PP, but developing a film ( or having it done somewhere) and then scan the few ones you think you like is not very time consuming. I think the best part of film/slide for me is the fact that you have to deliver while you take the picture, so I am more conscious of perfect exposure, etc. This intensifies the experience for me.

I have a variation of your situation. Here is my own personal take. In cynical disbelief that the M9 corrosion fiasco would ever be solved by a redesigned sensor (I did not believe this promise), I traded my faithful grey M9 for an M240. It was late 2014. I had loved my M9 (my forum name is testament to that!). The trade-in was in anger at Leica at the time. I vowed to myself I would never buy another digital M. The 240 replacement would be my last. It was one of the factors that led me heavily to film use in the last five years. I learned to develop and wet-print my own film at home - even colour prints. Well, the redesigned M9 sensor came out and it was hat-eating time for me. I hardly ever use my M240 - it is basically a forgotten camera. It is infinitely more flexible and useful as a digital camera than the M9 - live view, electronic spirit level, R-lens capability, even movies. These are nice features to have, but since I rarely use them, the camera sits unused, or rather acts as a lens-testing platform to judge things like haze and bokeh on old lenses. My film cameras have all the fun - the M240 rarely leaves the cupboard, and almost never leaves the house. A few days ago a friend offered me his beautiful black M9P. Like new condition, new sensor, 7k actuations, and a (not low but still reasonable) price (\u00a32,200). I felt an immediate bond to the M9. It feels like a camera I *know and understand* perfectly. And the images are stunning! Holding it and using it was/is a deeply tempting experience. Ultimately, however, I am declining it. For several reasons: 1. Shooting it side by side with the M240 the difference is visible. The M9 makes (to my eye) undeniably more beautiful images. M9 images look \u201cfilmic\u201d right out of the camera. M240 images look dead by comparison, and although I know they can be adjusted in LR, I hate using LR. But is that difference worth buying an M9 again? 2. On the M9 (unlike the M240) my wide angle lenses (notably the Elmarit 28 ASPH, 2011 version, but also the Summilux 21) show a green cast along the edges and corners. The green shows up in overcast skies in landscapes, and in rooms with white walls indoors. I don\u2019t like it, and here prefer the M240, which just gives me neutral colours all the way across the frame. 3. Believe it or not, I still feel sore about what happened with my M9 in 2014. To my mind there was an element of the weasel in Leica\u2019s behaviour with the M9, particularly when they implied that sensor corrosion was a user-fault in wet-cleaning sensors. And when they ignored that my camera was corroded, and it went back and forth between Oxford and Solms before I had to go in person to Mayfair and got a fair solution there, it was infuriating. I am not a forgiving person - I\u2019m sure you are, so forget my point 3. 4. I love film! If the M9 produces files that look filmic, that\u2019s not so much a reason for me to buy another one, than a reason to shoot more film! Anyway, your thoughts may very well vary from mine. I totally see where you are coming from on this M9 dilemma! I look forward to reading this thread. It might even convince me to change my mind and buy my friend\u2019s M9P!

I have not shot color film in many years since my only option is mailing the film off. Plus the cost of color film and processing. I believe a roll of color film and development and scanning for tiffs is about $30 per roll. 2. Fast shutter speed, either for fast action or shallower DOF in bright scenes. 3. Histogram when the action is fast and light is tricky. 4. I need to chimp to make sure I'm getting the shot, especially focus when it's fast moving action in lower light. Also, camera shake is getting to be more common for me. 5. Ability to change ISO. I often have a film and digital M in my bag, usually with different focal lengths. It gives me options.

Since then the photography bug turned from an interest to a hobby to now a passion. I have also enjoyed the tech and physical side of it. For me, I simply enjoy shooting window finders for the connection to the reality in front of me, the method, and the feel of history in the technique (m10 and xpro). When I need AF for family events and require accuracy and consistency (while participating in the event as well), I used to pick up an A7r(x), but now an SL2. You are right though, our journeys are all our own. It is clear to me that if you participate in a forum that is dedicated to discussing a particular camera or lens, you must also find the gear and tech important. And, if you decide to spend the time (which of course is limited for all of us to shoot) on these forums instead of out shooting, what is really more important? The gear or the photos?

It is really hard to beat how film translates light into tonality. I think the natural rolloff that you get from the photochemical processes tend to smooth out most of the extremes in tonality, in a way that is closer to the way that people see. I can make beautiful black and white conversions from modern digital cameras, but they are not AS beautiful as big film. There is a lightness to the tonality, a life. I know this kind of statement drives people who prefer digital mad, as it is difficult to quantify and difficult to \"prove\". I don't think it is a matter of proof. But I can say that as a professional printer for more than the past decade or so, as one who is very at home with a whole host of digital cameras, inkjet printers, scanners as well as the black and white and color darkrooms, that I have not seen more beautiful images than those made by talented photographers on 4x5 and 8x10. That most definitely includes Phase One right up to 150mp. Of course, this is said with the understanding that film is inconvenient, impractical and expensive in those formats, and that in most cases it is translated to digital at some point anyway (which does not cause it to lose its charm). But if you put a gun to my head as to one camera to use the rest of my life, no exceptions, it would be my Ebony 4x5.

This discussion seems to be split between collectors and accumulators and I wouldn't call someone who has 40+ camera bodies an Accumulator. I repeat: each to their own.

These cameras, apart from one of the 503cw bodies and my Leica MP, are all left-overs from the days when I used film professionally. Following a decades-long hiatus from GAS, my last acquisition was in October this year. I caved-in to temptation and bought the second 503cw body mainly because it was probably the very last completely unused Hasselblad 503cw body in existence. I know the history of this particular camera because the original purchaser is a friend of mine, another pro now retired, who bought it new in 2000 and put the unopened box in a cupboard for 20 years. He offered it to me at the same price he paid for it new in 2000, \u00a3912. The very first thing I did when I got my hands on it was to put a lens on it, load an A12 with film and make some images.

None of them mentioned sensor corrosion either. Of course, the reviewers concerned would soon find their work dried up if they were negative about something they were employed to talk about. This forum helped me to make the informed decision not to buy that camera, even though, at the time, there was no Brexit and Wetzlar would take cameras from the UK for repair.

I was saddened to read that overheating and freezing is still a problem with M10s although once again those issues are never mentioned by the online reviews, only by the honest responses of the members on here. To all those who've come forward and said it like it is, thank you, your feedback is very important to those like me, contemplating a big investment. The Brexit problems have been the decider for me for the time being. Reading the posts on this thread in conjunction with those about the freezing and overheating of M10s, effectively means that for me to buy an M10 right now, I'd be buying something which has a well documented fault that some cameras develop and with no easy recourse for repair if that should be the case (my enquiries from a UK Leica dealer reveal that any technical electronic repairs mean having to send the camera to Wetzlar).

It is rather simple, and does not need much space. I have a water bath heater with the size of a coffee cup which can control the temperature within 1 degree in the range of 10~50 degree.

I use one-shot chemistry for B&W, HC100, Rodinal, and PMK are my favorite, and I will stay with HC100 once my Rodinal and PMK runs out. C41 is not one-shot. The develop drum I have is not convenient for draining the used chemical back to the bottle. I used to use Jobo develop drum but I add to it the DUOLAB type lid (unfortunate, discontinued!) that you can screw the Job chemical bottle to the lid. The development starts with turning bottle-drum pair to pour the chemical into the drum, and stops by turning the bottle-drum pair to drain the chemical back to the bottle. I repeat this for every steps (dev, stop, fix, etc.). (Jobo's recommended setup, CPP or CPE, takes too much space, though it could be more efficient.). Depends on the amount of films to develop, I choose the drum of the right size (1~6 rolls at a time). The whole process is less an hour, not much more than driving to the photo labs (forget it, no longer a choice). Converting to digital file is through a digital camera.

It must be absolutely pattern-less. E: Some note about the acrylic film holder: Cleaning the acrylic or glass surface is a nightmare. You don't want to do that on the inner surface. Outer surface is OK since the acrylic is so thick and far out of focus. To keep the inner surface clean, never scratch it and never expose it to air or touch it, except changing the film. Always wear proper gloves. I made s spacer about the thickness of the film by taping a electrical tape on the edge of the inner surface. This way, the center area of the inner surface is more free from scratching each other. I actually also made a spacer on the outer surface by the same thing. This is so to prevent the outer surface scratched by the light panel. though it is less necessary. ***** By the way, on the digitizing exposure, color reversal, white balance, and color adjust. I found the camera auto exposure is no good for color negatives. My practice is to calibrate the exposure on the first picture of that film type. Method 1: Take a shot, check the exposure histogram. If it is not centered, redo it by changing the exposure (shutter speed). Method 2: Take a shot, convert to positive, check the exposure histogram. If it is not centered, redo it by changing the exposure (shutter speed). Depends on the film, you should find one of the two methods more favorable. Once you are happy, stick to that exposure value. In my case, the raw negative exposure usually looks very thin. After the reversal, I find just a simple white balance by clicking on the grey or white area (a white clothes or a paved road, for example) does an excellent job.

If your chemicals are too hot and also very fresh they can cause this effect. Yes that might be the freshness as I started wit ha new 1 liter kit and put 12 400iso rolls through it. However I got consistently bad results for the most part with 2 or 3 rolls of the bunch coming up ok. I'm leaning towards bad batch from a supplier because sometimes i developed two rolls where one came out alright and the other didn't. Also I have a pretty basic cheap thermometer that's analogue and hard to read accurately. I guess I could have been off perfect 38C\u00b0 by ~1 degree. @250swb do you recon being a bit off on the temperature can give such radically bad results? Contamination is my other suspicion, because I didn't have the bottles labeled properly at first (just the lids) which since then has been corrected. i tried scanning them last night with both a dedicated scanner and an digital camera: unfortunately they are too contrasty and dense - the positives come out as if they were shot on an instant film (very high contrast and colour shifts). It's a great shame because I have 12 rolls of this and they're all in a mixed bag so I can't tell which one is which. Another lesson learned I guess... 6 hours ago, adan said: I tend to go with the \"different shops\" theory, unless you know exactly how they were stored in each store, and for how long, and how old they were (expiration dates). Film stored in too warm an environment can go bad before the expiration date (which assumes, at most, \"room\" temperatures - 72\u00b0F or less, except for that Pro-Image film supposedly designed for the tropics). Leaving color film in a car (or camera) baking in the sun can fog it pretty quickly - but I guess just shooting around the house during lockdown rules that out in this case. Color film has a lot of organic chemicals in it (dyes and such) and it is best to treat it like mayonnaise - don't let it get too warm for any length of time! Yes that was my thinking exactly, but I still want to rule every other option out before starting to blame the supplier. I stored the rolls in the fridge, as I do, and the film was supposed be good till 2021 when I got it. I do leave film in the camera however, sometimes for up to a week, @adan do you think this can cause such an issue? I also take a roll or two out of the fridge and keep them in my bag as spares at all times. Perhaps that's not advisable as well - I just wasn't sure if it's ok to load shoot film straight from the fridge. Also, I enjoyed the mayonnaise analogy In any case, I am now replacing the chemistry and getting a new more precise digital thermometer to at least try and eliminate these two parameters. P.S.

I got through ten rolls of Proimage (plus 1200 digital images) on our trip. As we were going to be there for the Holi festival where folks chuck buckets of coloured powder over each other and not wanting to expose my R9 or digital CL to this, I bought a virtually unused and boxed compact Yashica 110W auto-focus, motor-drive camera complete with Zeiss zoom lens for \u00a38 from our local charity shop. It is almost the same camera as the very fashionable and expensive Contax T3 but with a blobby aluminium instead of square edged titanium body. I bought Kodak Ultramax 400 to use with this. The end results of the Ultramax are far better than the Proimage, which is sold as a cheap budget film in India. The Proimage has a very 1950's Ektacolor washed out look. From now on I am going to stick to Ektar, Portra, Ulltramax and Ektachrome for colour. Anything else is a false economy, home or professional processed.

Like I said, there is enough leeway in the technique so that by the time you have exhausted the kit it makes little or no difference if you have mixed low and high ISO films during processing, it is only if you have predominately processed high ISO films (or push processed) that you would throw the chemicals away sooner. I think you'll get to the theoretical time to throw the chemicals away whatever the ISO is and be thinking 'these must be good enough for a few more films yet'. And they will be, but that is where the cliff edge is, it's an unknown area beyond the safe 'use by' limit in the instructions. Either way the chemicals don't suddenly fail so perhaps until you get the hang of them photograph a test chart on each film to compare the first and then last to see if any difference in colour is creeping in. Thanks Steve, so for the first few tries, I will stick to given use by charts, which is 12 rolls for ISO400 and above or 16 rolls for ISO200 and below, both at 38. At least this way if I do a mistake I can narrow it down faster and also have an understanding what an optimal result should look like should the development go smoothly. In the future, probably I can process first Portra and Ektars and towards the end continue with Gold etc. On another question, all the instructions are given for either 1lt solution or 500ml. However my tank (if you'd recall) requires 600ml solution. Do you think I can pour 600ml back to the bottle once I develop first 2 rolls, where 400ml fish solution is, mix them and then develop another couple of rolls with the same duration for the first couple rolls? If that is not clear, what I mean is (fresh unused 1lt solution); develop 2 rolls with 600ml at 03:15, pour the developer back to the bottle where 400ml fresh developer is and develop another 2 rolls with mixed developer again at 03:15?

It's a confusing typo, and to be honest if you are being so mean as to not just round up the numbers so two 35mm films need 600ml of developer then you are forever going to be dithering on the edge of success or failure.

Time in the developer doesn't necessarily increase grain, if you over develop that will increase grain, but each developer and film has their own characteristics, time vs temperature. Back in the day Kodak Microdol X was the developer to bring down grain in films it's times were 9 minutes at 20 degrees C, if I remember correctly, but it produced \"mushy\" grain and most photographers used D76 with TriX.

The very nature of .dng files is that you make choices when you get in front of the PC, and film profiles are often a great starting point when it comes to post processing. They are only what you could do using Levels and Curves anyway and if you find one that works why do all the extra work. It's also good if you have an image and you're not quite sure what to do with to go through the profiles and see if they give you any ideas, it's only what a film photographer would do in trying different contrasts of paper before making a choice. Remove the grain or keep it, that is the question. Overt grain isn't a prerequisite of film, some photographers would choose grainy films and other very fine grain. What grain can do is change the emotional response to an image, it also gives the eye something to latch onto in broad areas of otherwise empty space. I guess most photographers didn't buy a digital camera to have grain so removing it is the popular option, but as a creative option it's still valid.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/314272-how-to-get-skin-tone-like-classical-bw-film/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-4067098", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "314272-how-to-get-skin-tone-like-classical-bw-film", "result": false, "Selector": "[ideas, making]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "it's also good if you have an image and you're not quite sure what to do with to go through the profiles and see if they give you any ideas, it's only what a -----> film !!!  photographer would do in trying different contrasts of paper before making a choice.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 110317, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "adan", "date": "2020-11-22 05:00:00", "content": "--img--  My system really has not changed since 2000 or so (including film scans as well as digital originals).

I'm still on perpetual version (6.14 on Windows). It does everything I need and still supports all the cameras I have. I've been with LR since the Beta test versions, so alo a long history with the tool Even when I get an \"unsupported\" camera in the future I can get the latest and free DNG converter. My old LR perpetual licence will still open these newer camera DNG files. Just one extra step in the workflow. I know I'm foregoing some improvements in later Lightroom CC classic versions but so be it. For me it's not so much the ongoing subscription money (that's not significantly different from buying perpetual upgrades in the past), it's the \"end play\" when you stop the subscription that bothers me. When you stop the subscription the develop module gets disabled so basically you're stuck with the library and rudimentary library develop tools. However you can still import new files into the library. What I think would be a much more sensible \"end play\" is keep the develop module active (so you can still work on all the files you took/imported during the subscription) but disable the import module so no new files can be added after stopping the subscription. In case that would happen I would be seriously considering the subscription, but until then it's a no go zone for me. I also use C1 (version 10), but only for development of certain shots, Lightroom is my workhorse raw developer as well as it contains all the digital images in its database that I have ever made (film scans and digital captures) Edited February 2, 2020 by pegelli", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/304357-lightroom-v67-perpetual-where-to-go-from-here-don%E2%80%99t-want-subscription-adobe-cc/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-3904468", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "304357-lightroom-v67-perpetual-where-to-go-from-here-don%E2%80%99t-want-subscription-adobe-cc", "result": false, "Selector": "i have ever made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i also use c1 (version 10), but only for development of certain shots, lightroom is my workhorse raw developer as well as it contains all the digital images in its database that i have ever made (-----> film !!!  scans and digital captures) edited february 2, 2020 by pegelli", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 112377, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Loomis77", "date": "2020-12-23 19:58:00", "content": " Hello there! I am a newish photographer who has a Pentax DSLR and a Leica D-Lux 7 (\u2018Not a proper Leica\u201d I hear you say \ud83d\ude09) both of which I enjoy using. However, I have always wanted a Leica (primarily because of its stellar name and quality). However, I just don\u2019t know where to start. Whilst I love the idea of film, I am not sure I will get round to developing, etc. and, therefore, am probably looking for a digital model. I tend to prefer prime lenses but, again, not quite sure where to start! I am aware of the costs involved in starting in the Leica system and that is why I am asking you experienced folk what may be the best bet and where to look for said best bet. Many thanks in advance all. Stay safe and a happy Christmas!
