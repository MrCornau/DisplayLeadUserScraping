The very good thing about Leica prices is they FORCE me to make Leica purchasing decisions very carefully and very slowly.

Personally, I have a few questions about the M10-P conversion program and waiting to hear back from OP and other people's experiences.

If you remember your other post on your projects (in Barnack's), I like them very much. In the Don McCullin video you posted, one of the significant features of his picture-process is that he engages with his subjects almost every time. They instantly cease to be anonymous, even if we don't always learn their names. I apologize that the pix below are not Leica (albeit rangefinder, Mamiya 6, made a couple of weeks ago) - Like McCullin, I shoot film in medium-format these days, and that is what I was using on this day. (By very odd coincidence, this series was taken about 30 meters from my previous-page 2007 PrideFest series). Also like McCullin, I try to engage with my subjects. I spent 10 minutes sitting on the sidewalk talking with Brandy face-to-face, learning how she came to be in Denver, what her life has been like, found out she was an activist fighting aganst Denver's \"urban camping ban\" (a bureaucratic attempt to drive the homeless off the streets at night). But I'll let her tell some of it in her own words (see below pictures). In the case of a project, the occasional anonymous picture absorbs context from the rest of the project.

It captures photons of light and outputs an analogous number of electrons, which are read out as a charge (CCD) or a voltage (CMOS). Those are measured to produce the brightness values assigned to each pixel of the image. It doesn't matter what ISO is set - the sensor puts out a constant value of electrons based on the inflow of photons received per pixel. 1 photon = 1 electron (more or less) regardless of whether the ISO is set to 200 or 6400. 3) There is (generally speaking) no way to force the sensor to put out a different value - it can't be \"amped up\" with more or less power, for example. But the identical signal it puts out at ISO 200 or ISO 6400 can be \"amped up\" farther down the digital imaging chain. 4) When you change the ISO on a digital camera, you are doing two things: 4A) you are telling the camera processing electronics (not the sensor) to amplify the signal after exposure. Not unlike push-processing film - the weak signal gets multiplied after the fact to produce more brightness than the exposure would normally produce at \"box speed\" (or \"base ISO\"). And 4B ) you are telling the metering system to compensate for that amplification (which in turn tells you reduce the exposure via shutter and aperture). As jkcampbell2's example shows, there is not much difference between the camera amplifying the signal (by setting the ISO dial to 3200) or the photographer amplifying the signal in Photoshop/ACR/LR later on. It's all just computer math - a brightest pixel value of 15 gets multiplied 2^4x (16x) to 240, along with a certain loss of quality (grain with film, noise with a digital signal). However..... 1 hour ago, jaapv said: Yes, and the point is that cranking up the ISO doesn\u2019t alter the exposure (amount of light falling on the sensor). To do that you must change the only the two exposure parameters: shutter time and aperture. ...or use a neutral density or other filter. Or add light to the scene, with anything from car headlights to a flash to a full Hollywood lighting setup. Or simply chose a brighter or darker scene to begin with. All of those also determine the amount of light falling on the sensor or film. There are not \"only two exposure parameters\" - and never really have been. Box Brownies and similar came with a fixed shutter speed (\"Instantaneous\" - somewhere around 1/30th sec). Many came with a fixed aperture (f/11 or so). About the only thing you could change was the ISO used - generally something in the ISO 125 range like Verichrome Pan, but eventually faster (and slower) films. Nevertheless, billions of family snapshots were made with such devices. The fact that one can get a \"bad exposure\" by using the wrong ISO, or the wrong filter - just as easily as using the wrong shutter speed or aperture - shows that ISO is just as much a determinant of correct exposure as the others. Exposure is not just the amount of light falling on the sensor - it is the correct final range of tones in the finished picture. I want to make a picture. I want to use a specific shutter speed (for motion control, not just exposure and amount of light). I want to use a specific aperture (for DoF control, not just exposure and amount of light). ISO becomes another variable I can use, just like changing the lighting, or adding an ND filter, to make the exposure correct. I can walk around all day with a camera set to a fixed ISO (with film cameras, I have to). And vary the aperture and shutter speed to get a correct exposure. Or set the camera to \"A\" and let it vary the shutter speed (with a fixed aperture - the old photojournalists' mantra, \"f/5.6 and be there\"). But these days, I can also walk around all day with a camera set to a fixed aperture and shutter speed (say, f/4 and 1/2000th sec.). And let the camera automatically vary the ISO to get correct exposures everywhere I go. ISO has a more limited range (8 stops with the M10 Auto ISO, from 200 to 50000), while using auto-shutter gives me at least 12 stops (1/4000-1 sec) and 19 stops if I use shutter and aperture together.

I have yet to clean my sensor and am rather apprehensive about doing so! @howiebrou, This is not official sensor cleaning doctrine from anyone or from any manufacturer; it is just the method I use and is based on sensor cleaning instructions found in the M-P 240 manual and the instructions that come with the swabs and cleaning fluid I use. I have had 100% positive results with 0% problems as a result of using this cleaning technique. I seem to need to clean my sensor about once every 6-9 months. I clean my sensor when multiple dust specks show up in post processing that require an annoying amount of time and work to clone over, not every time a spot or two turns up in post. This description is from a blog post that I wrote for my website; I hope this will shed some light on the sensor cleaning process (we are actually cleaning the protective glass cover, not the sensor itself) for you and others. Quote Digital cameras have sensors; unless your camera has a built in dust reduction system, sooner or later your sensor will need to be cleaned - it's inevitable. Then what?? It's a lot quicker, easier and less costly to do it yourself - if you follow your camera manual instructions exactly and are careful, you can successfully clean your camera's sensor yourself. A lot of photographers fear damaging their sensor and will do about anything to avoid cleaning it themselves. However, there is no reason to be afraid to do this procedure yourself, provided you do it properly. You will need the right sensor cleaning supplies - I use Eclipse Optic Cleaning Fluid and Photosol Sensorswab Ultra sensor cleaning swabs. If your camera has a full frame (24x36mm ) sensor, you will need the Type 3 swabs; they are 24 mm wide, as is your sensor. APS-C and smaller sensors will need smaller swabs. Photosol's website has information that will help you determine which swab is right for your camera. One of the most important factors in successful sensor cleaning is to perform this procedure in a clean, dust free environment. Not many of us have access to a clean room such as computer manufacturers build computers in. If your home has airborne dust issues you will need to clean your sensor in an environment where dust is less of a problem (you can check for airborne dust by looking through the beam of a bright flashlight at night; if you see a lot of dust particles dancing in the air, you should probably go elsewhere to clean your sensor). Where would that be? Try a museum or a library; find a spot away from frequent foot traffic, entries and exits and away from heating and cooling ducts that will cause airflow that will stir up any dust that may be present.. Another important point is this - do not use compressed air (\"canned air\") to blow dust from your sensor before cleaning. Canned air can spray liquid propellant onto your sensor cover glass, something you do not want to happen. That liquid can also get behind the sensor and into the electronic components of your camera. If that happens, you are in for a serious repair bill. Instead of canned air, use a blower bulb like the Giottos Rocket Blaster, which will safely remove loose dust particles from your sensor. Also, do not blow dust from your sensor using your breath, as you can spray tiny droplets of saliva into the camera. The sensor swabs I use are dry, which means I need to apply the proper cleaning fluid to them before use. Too much cleaning fluid can damage the electronics inside your camera, so proceed with caution. I have found that five drops on the 24mm wide swabs my camera requires is sufficient (three drops on one side, two on the opposite side, equally spaced across the width of the swab); I would be comfortable using two drops per side, but no more than five drops for a 24 mm wide swab. Again, follow the directions that come with your swabs and cleaning fluid to the letter. Each camera has a specific procedure for sensor cleaning; if you precisely adhere to the instructions in your camera manual, you should have a successful sensor cleaning result. If there are still spots on your sensor after cleaning, you can re-clean the sensor provided your camera manual does not advise against doing so (I once ended up with an eyelash on my sensor that required two cleanings to remove; the first try simply moved it closer to the center of the sensor; this happens sometimes). If you follow the directions in your camera manual and in your swab and cleaning fluid to the letter, you should have no problems cleaning your sensor at home (or at your local museum or library, if need be). DISCLAIMER 1: The above description of sensor cleaning is simply a description of how I clean my sensor; it is not intended as training or professional advice in sensor cleaning. 2: Always follow the directions in your camera manual and in your sensor cleaning materials to the letter.

So the exposure had been only roughly corrected, and no attempt was made to set the optimum white balance. I should have made this clear in my original posting. I didn't upload the original DNG because our forum has a file size limitation. I curious as to why this false yellow colour had been generated. Hours of experimentation with Capture One have shown that it could not be removed by changing the exposure, camera profile, or colour balance. I'm a journalist. Forty years ago I would have been accompanied by a lensman, but in today's world the man with the notebook is expected to take his own pics. That orange-jacket photo showed a potential future nightmare - the presidents of Boeing and Scruggs Airways pose in front of the Boeing 767 at next month's Paris Air Show to announce an order to 50 aircraft, and decide to do this wearing orange high-vis jackets with the Boeing (or Scruggs) logo. All the other journalists get a useable photo (just as the other photographers on last week's outing seem to have had no problem with the orange jacket), but I get one that makes it look like the poor guys had been attacked by yellow-paint-wielding protestors. That's the sort of misfortune that would earn this poor freelance the sort of interview with a magazine editor in which coffee is not served. Back in the film era, I would load my camera with whatever seemed the best film for the job, and my only decision on image processing was whether to get this done by Joe's Basement or Metro Imaging. (I preferred Metro because when I went to buy film, the counter staff could advise of the best emulsion to use for the task in hand - told that I heading off to an event organised by the Israeli ministry of defence, they regaled me with a sad tale of how an expensive fashion shoot in the Egyptian desert needed to be entirely restaged some weeks later using a different film type because the colour balance from the first attempt had been uncorrectably cool.) In today's digital age, shooting in JPEG and relying on the camera get the exposure and colour-balance reasonably right is the basic modus operandi for a journalist, and this way of working has rather influenced my 'off-duty' approach to digital photography. Sergei Gorshkov, commander in chief of the Soviet Navy from 1956 to 1985, is reported to have a plaque on the wall of his office that read \"Better is the enemy of good enough\". Following this maxim, I set my M9, Digilux 3 and D-Lux Typ 109 cameras to produce both JPEG and raw files. Wherever possible I treat the JPEG as a ready-to-use 'good enough' image, leaving the raw file as the 'In case of emergency, break the glass' solution for photos that need significant manipulation. The 'as shot' white balance from the camera is almost invariably better the 'auto' version that the software offers. If this white balance is unacceptable, the only correction I normally make would be to 'pick' on something that is neutral or near-neutral - as a journalist it was often relatively easy to make sure than a piece of white paper or even my black-covered reporter's notebook had been included in the photo. With the Leica M-D, there is no JPEG output, so Capture One and RawTherapee have become the equivalent of Joe's Basement and Metro Imaging - I use Irfanview to scan through the raw files and delete the obvious failures, then pass the others through one of these programs in order to generate JPEG versions. If one program has problems with one or more specific pics, the other will probably do a better job. Perhaps I'm a bit of a digital philistine, but the reason that I moved to the M-D was the desire to escape from modes and menus, and return to the simplicity of film-era shooting. So I must confess to having as much desire to explore the many 'bells & whistles' of Capture One or RawTherapee (curves, tints, et al,) as I have of learning how to operate an E-6 processing machine. I've posted below the results of running the orange-jacket pic through RawTherapee, and making some initial corrections. The software has made a reasonable job of rendering the overexposed jacket and the burned-out hand, but the whites (such as the woman's shoes) show some magenta contamination.

(i preferred metro because when i went to buy film, the counter staff could advise of the best emulsion to use for the task in hand - told that i heading off to an event organised by the israeli ministry of defence, they regaled me with a sad tale of how an expensive fashion shoot in the egyptian desert needed to be entirely restaged some weeks later using a different film type because the colour balance from the first attempt had been uncorrectably cool.) in today's digital age, shooting in jpeg and relying on the camera get the exposure and colour-balance reasonably right is the basic modus operandi for a journalist, and this way of working has rather influenced my 'off-duty' approach to digital photography. sergei gorshkov, commander in chief of the soviet navy from 1956 to 1985, is reported to have a plaque on the wall of his office that read \"better is the enemy of good enough\". following this maxim, i set my m9, digilux 3 and d-lux typ 109 cameras to produce both jpeg and raw files. wherever possible i treat the jpeg as a ready-to-use 'good enough' image, leaving the raw file as the 'in case of emergency, break the glass' solution for photos that need significant manipulation. the 'as shot' white balance from the camera is almost invariably better the 'auto' version that the software offers. if this white balance is unacceptable, the only correction i normally make would be to 'pick' on something that is neutral or near-neutral - as a journalist it was often relatively easy to make sure than a piece of white paper or even my black-covered reporter's notebook had been included in the photo. with the leica m-d, there is no jpeg output, so capture one and rawtherapee have become the equivalent of joe's basement and metro imaging - i use irfanview to scan through the raw files and delete the obvious failures, then pass the others through one of these programs in order to generate jpeg versions. if one program has problems with one or more specific pics, the other will probably do a better job. perhaps i'm a bit of a digital philistine, but the reason that i moved to the m-d was the desire to escape from modes and menus, and return to the simplicity of film-era shooting. so i must confess to having as much desire to explore the many 'bells & whistles' of capture one or rawtherapee (curves, tints, et al,) as i have of learning how to operate an e-6 processing machine. i've posted below the results of running the orange-jacket pic through rawtherapee, and making some initial corrections. the software has made a reasonable job of rendering the overexposed jacket and the burned-out hand, but the whites (such as the woman's shoes) show some magenta contamination. so the pic still needs some further work. the blacks are still not zero, reflecting the fact that in the real world, the darkest tones are rarely pure black. --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 20561, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Paulus", "date": "2019-04-14 12:58:00", "content": "Am 13.3.2019 um 18:01 schrieb vkdev: The error disappears when I pull out the battery and insert it back.

I'm kind of used to it now. The files it puts out make it all worthwhile. I'll keep using that camera for as long as I can.

I realize that Monochrom Type I users are a minority within a minority of Leica photographers. It's not a camera for the general public, or even Leica fans at large, hence Leica sees no profit in CCD sensors. Leica (like all business enterprises) follows the money. We (MMI shooters) see what we see - even when others don't see. Stefan Daniel recently said this about CCD technology and rendering when recently interviewed for the 10 year anniversary of the M9 (Google translation)... \u201cIn 2009, CMOS sensors had already begun to take precedence over CCDs. Why still opt for CCD technology, and why at Kodak in particular? [Laughs] That's pretty funny because today I still get requests for a new M with a CCD. Some photographers seem to like, and regret, the rendering of the CCD. But as for why we stayed on CCD in the M9, it's very simple: Kodak, at that time, was the only company that wanted to customize a sensor with the network of micro-lenses that we had designed. So, the choice was quickly made since it was the only one. In any case, even in 2019, I'm sure that if we released a Leica M CCD sensor, it would sell to some fans of the CCD look. But it's not in the program and, in any case, technology no longer exists.Finally, it has not completely disappeared, since it is still used in some industrial sensors, but for photography, the CCD has completely disappeared. In any case, today, this technology would have no interest compared to CMOS. Most importantly, it is the image processing algorithms that have the most influence on color rendering than the sensor technology itself.

Your first reply makes it sound like I am criticising Leica, and your second reply makes it sound like I am defending them. I am doing neither. My reply is based on my own experience. In fact, very recent experience. After cleaning the sensor on my M8, I picked it up to put into my bag. As I did so, the camera slipped out of my hand and bounced on the sofa.

Then again I should imagine you have your own personal team of gnomes from Solms following you around with a shiny Leica support van, re-setting your bodies like a tennis pro has rackets tensioned ? No? --img--  I know this is not for everyone and that's not what I'm saying - my aim in posting is to share the work I have done and the successes I have had with my own adjustments. It is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. It is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. That's all. So Jamie - this is the explanation I posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. As adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. You will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (A) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. A) is the focus throw adjustment. If you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. If you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. As you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. By moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you INCREASE the total available focus throw. By moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you DECREASE the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. Right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. From my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) Infinity is very important. Step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today I've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. Don't accept the nonesense I was spouting before about it not mattering. It really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) Now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. I found text to be excellent. Note whether you now have front focus or back focus. If you have front focus (like I did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. So you need to shorten the arm by loosening (A) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise. (If you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) Now, recheck infinity. It will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. But this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) Repeat step 2. You will see that the focus point has altered. Whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general I made positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) When you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. On my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) I did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. When my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range. I suppose that if this were not the case or if your lenses varied then you'd need to get them recalibrated, or maybe accept a compromise setting. Hope that's helpful.

For my understanding, the only better place to look for used camera in Asia is Japan although their price are not cheap, but at least they are honest enough to explain the condition of the camera before we can make purchase decision.

I'm new to M-mount lenses and have been shooting them on my Nikon Z6 and Z7 cameras by way of a Yeenon branded adapter (with helicoid). I'm shooting primarily Cosina Voigtlander stuff (21/1.8, 35/1.7, 40/1.4 SC, 50/1.5) and a few old L39 Nikkors. I've just begun experimenting with ND filters on these lenses and was totally perplexed when I began seeing some light leaks appearing in my images. My first thought was the adapter. While I wasn't using the close-focusing mechanism, a built-in helicoid that extends the lens a bit further and significantly decreases the minimum focusing distance, I thought perhaps that was coming into play. More moving parts, more gaps, more chance of light making it through. Furthermore, the CV 35/1.7, the lens I was using at the time, and the Yeenon adapter are chrome plated brass. Tons of reflective surfaces all around. Maybe light was reflecting off of the sensor glass, onto the back of the adapter and lens, and then back to the sensor again? This thread however, gives me great relief on one hand, that I'm not alone. But also frustrates me that the mount can allow for this. I have yet to test the hairband solution, though having read through this, I anticipate it will prove the point. I will be sure to update after I test it, for further reinforcement.

I was shooting semi-pro event and wedding photographer for a while using DSLR with all big zooms, honestly I was doing it for purely extra income purpose. After 1-2 years, I have found I will not even touch my gears if it's not a job. I found I was then not a happy shooter anymore. For some reason, maybe my works weren't too impressed or maybe I dun care too much about marketing and promoting myself to the public, I have no more clients, and I found I'm not shooting anymore. I decided to sell all my chunky pro grade equipments and just left alone with me a first Fuji X100 for daily casual image capturing which I dun do a lot too. But being a guy, whose used to do some sort of photograph, I still have that kind of gear searching \"blood\", I then remember when I first shooting just for fun, I always fancy a Leica, I was no any kind of knowledge or experience with the brand, the only things I know about Leica is it looks good, it looks classic and it is very expensive. For the price point, I wouldn't even think about it. Here come, my curiousness drive me to start to search if any possible way to have an easy outfit with more reasonable price to get into the fantasy of owning one. I've been searching online, reading here and there, I was thinking to get a camera that even have lower mp than my original Fuji X100, somehow, the curiousness drove me to make a shot. I picked up an used M8, with the first lens Voigthlander Nokton 35 f1.4, It was a \"wow\" for me holding it in my hand for how well it was build.

As you commented not to much a problem for you, unless you wanted to do transparency work. With my M-A when it comes to the narrowest of the spacings it is difficult to cut between the frames without cutting into them because of how closely they are spaced together. And of course the worry is also if the problem persists and progressively worsens over time? As I have read in some instance it can lead to frames overlapping. Paul Paul, I'm not being cavalier about this. I have a few Leicas and don't bother to mark on the negatives which camera they came from. I will make a mental note the next time I use the M-A to see exactly how it behaves but I myself have posted about \"narrow\" frame separation. I attribute it to the angle of incidence of light hitting the film with RF wideangles, which can put the back lens element very close to the film. Because of the rangefinder I've learned to frame a little loosey-goosey to make sure I get what I want in the frame, so if the scissors clip a bit of the frame I don't lose needed parts of the image within. But that's *me*. *You* are treating it differently and that is your option and right. If your M-A is a replacement already you might not want to use it a lot if you want to keep replacing it again an option. I have no answer there. I can only suggest you shoot it in and see if things \"improved\" which could certainly burn at least one bridge. I have never seen overlapping frames.

I get what your saying about the Leicas being based on a design that has produced cameras that has outlived and out-performed most of its contemporaries. What a beautiful deigned camera that has stood the test of time. And that\u2019s what made me decide to buy the M-A. And I also get what your saying about a camera designed back in the 1920s, might have been technologically advanced then but the same design may may throw up a few quirks compared to a \u2018modern\u2019 designed camera. The problem is not in the M-A having narrower spacings between the frames of the negatives, which is far smaller in width compared to the M7, but more importantly it is the inconsistency of the spacings where the spacings vsry significantly in width. There does not appear to be a common pattern where this occurs. It can occur anywhere on the negatives. I will continue to use the M-A and see if it \u201cgrows\u201d out if this problem. But I doubt it, as I adopted the same approach with the first M-A and it continued with the same problem. But thank you again for you thoughts and comments. It is much appreciated.

Hi, this is my first post here. I am struggling with focus adjustment. I thought, I could adapt the lens on a mirrorless camera (Fujifilm X-T2) and use 7artisans adjustment tips.

For the last trip I had the 1dx and the 5DSr with me. Both lenses (100-400mm and the 2.8/300mm) have been the Mark II versions. As I might to go back to Africa next year, I asked myself what gear to take with me. So I made a simple experiment in the garden. My target was to get a reasonable sharp picture on an 27\u00b4\u00b4 5k iMac with crop that would get from an 800mm lens without cropping. In the race was: Leica SL with the 90-280mm 5DSr with the 100-400mm II 5DSr with the 2.8/300mm II with 2*converter 5DSr with the Tamron 150-600mm All lensed shot wide open from a tripod. The Leica picture was not really acceptable, because I had to crop it down to 4MPx. The Tamron was okay, but took no advantage from the 600mm. The winner was the 5DSr with the 100-400mm. The 2.8/300mm was close (this combo needs to be stopped down). The reason to tell this is that a high resolution sensor with an excellent lens allows to have less weight with you.

I have to think of the reason I bought the CL in the first place, and that was mainly because of the ability to use my M lenses. Purchased with the 18-56 I was delighted with IQ from the zoom and it still is in my view a great travel option. I went on to purchase the 23/35/ and 55-135 TL. I still have them all but feel I could live without the 23 (easily), and the 35 because of my M lens options. The 55-135 is another story though. I have had the M135 you talk of in the past, and actually wish I hadn't sold it, may get another copy sometime but I cannot think of when I would mount that in preference to the 55-135 zoom.

This Executive Order led to the forced removal and incarceration of some 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast, who had to abandon their jobs, their homes, and their lives to be sent to one of ten concentration camps scattered in desolate, remote regions of the country. No Japanese Americans were ever charged, much less convicted, of espionage or sabotage against the United States. Yet they were targeted, rounded up, and imprisoned for years, simply for having the \"face of the enemy.\" Every February, the Japanese American community commemorates Executive Order 9066 as a reminder of the impact the incarceration experience has had on our families, our community, and our country. It is an opportunity to educate others on the fragility of civil liberties in times of crisis, and the importance of remaining vigilant in protecting the rights and freedoms of all.

However, your Tri-Elmar-M 16-18-21mm f/4 ASPH is FF and not APS-C as is my TL18-56, will this make any difference? I must admit I'm most unsure of my ground here. Also what CL camera features does one sacrifice when using the V-10? AF obviously, but are there any others? As an aside, I must say that I'm most impressed with the quality of your mono work, is there a 'simple' secret, that you'd like to share? Thanks for your patience. Thank you for the compliment. There's no secret sauce that's simple. Good B&W work is a matter of understanding the recording medium, an exposure, and how to render it. I experiment with my camera and lens a lot so as to understand the sensor and what I can get out of them. On exposure, well, the experience lent by 50 plus years of shooting B&W inform me as to what I want in my exposure, and what I want to lose. Regards rendering, I have a set of rather pathological presets for Lightroom that I made to push exposures in extreme different directions ... I usually know which one is going to work for a given scene, but I often try one or two of them as experiments. They let me see what's there and how to go.. Once I choose one as a base, I tweak it until I get what I want ... and if I can't get what I want, I either start over or just stop (and maybe return at a later time). An 18mm focal length is the same regardless of the format the lens will cover. Both the lenses I used are designed to cover a FF format, which means they cover APS-C easily since its a smaller format, but their focal lengths are the same as any lens made with the same focal length. Your TL lens is designed to cover APS-C so if you could use it on FF format the corner and edge performance might degrade a bit. But if it's truly an 18mm focal length at the set marking, it will have the exact same FoV as the Tri-Elmar-M 16-18-21mm at the same focal length. Using the V10 on the CL is like using any other M-mount adapted lens: exposure modes are limited to Manual and Aperture priority AE, and you must focus the lens manually. You set aperture and focus on the lens using the lens' controls. (Of course, the DoF of a 10mm lens is so great that I normally just set f/8 and about 10 feet on the scale, and forget about it.)

I use only the WATE wide-angle and 28mm and up. These lenses have until now worked well on many different sensors. And I would be very surprised if the S1R would be the only (negative) exception. Panasonic has probably no need to compromise their sensor to make it work with them. And yes, probably the SL2 will be the best solution. But maybe it still has mandatory LENR and it is certainly not the most economic solution. \ud83d\ude0e. But if you worry about S lenses then the cost is certainly no problem. Well, unfortunately my experience has not been quite so good as yours. The Leica M lenses I use most are the 35mm and 50mm Summilux ASPH, and both were quite bad on the Sony cameras. By bad I mean sharp in the center, but with poor edge and corner performance even when stopped down past 5.6. The 75mm Summicron was also not great. The only lens that seemed to perform very well was the 135mm Tele-Elmar. I have not tried the Nikon or Canon mirrorless. I am pretty demanding of lens performance as I tend to print rather large, and I found that, at least with the Sony's, it was better for me to stick with the native lenses. As for the S lenses, I made a big investment in them in 2011 or 2012, and since then I have used the same camera, so the math did work reasonably well for me. That said, they are worth a small fraction of what they cost because the S system has been so slow in adapting to the market. Cost of a Panasonic or even a SL2 might not be such a big deal, especially if I sell some equipment, but dropping 20,000 plus dollars on an S3 (if that is what it will cost) is most certainly not a \"no problem\" kind of purchase. Again, the Panasonics seemed like they could be the silver bullet, working nearly natively with M, L and S lenses, but as I said before, unfortunately it does not seem like that is quite as true as I had hoped. We will see when they start getting into people's hands!

The SIGMA fp incorporates a 35mm full-frame Bayer sensor with 24.6 effective megapixels in a compact body, and boasts great versatility and scalability that allows mixing-and-matching of a variety of interchangeable lenses and accessories. It is a camera that is casual enough to take anywhere, anytime, and high-spec enough for serious still and cine shooting in the highest image quality, all in a robust and classy body. Regardless of the differences in shooting scenes and styles or genre boundaries between stills and videos, this new camera is set to expand the freedom and possibilities in image shooting and art creation further than ever before. A \u201cpocketable full-frame\u201d camera: SIGMA fp, is now available. SIGMA's take on an entirely new system camera. The world's smallest and lightest \u201cpocketable full-frame\u201d camera is here. The environment that surrounds shooting and art creation is undergoing radical changes. In this day and age when one user may have both a high-performance interchangeable lens camera and a smartphone camera, using them flexibly according to specific purposes and settings, SIGMA stopped and questioned the inherent value of a digital camera. As a result, SIGMA set itself to develop a user-oriented digital camera that reflected the idea of \u201chow a camera can be\u201d in a more flexible and true-to-life manner, without conforming to manufacturers' ideas of camera-centric categories and hierarchy. [Development concept] Pocketable full-frame\u2502Impressive portability and power The \u201csmallest and lightest body possible\u201d with which one can express their creative ideas whenever they want, combined with a \u201cfull-frame sensor\u201d that is suitable for serious occasions without compromising on image quality, and \u201csuperb build quality\u201d that makes the camera the perfect linchpin of a high-performance lens system.

Seamless\u2502Full-fledged, liberating shooting functions A \u201chighly intuitive UI\u201d that allows one to move between full-fledged still and cine shooting modes with just one finger, making for a \u201cseamless and truly creative tool\u201d that goes beyond style and genre differences. Making it a top priority to realize these three concepts all at once and without requiring any trade-offs, SIGMA selected only the elements and mechanisms that were truly needed with no compromise to create the SIGMA fp as the embodiment of an \u201centirely new digital camera that SIGMA can offer to the world right now.\u201d It's a camera body that changes its configuration with great flexibility centered around the user. It's a tool that gives the user the joy of a new camera life that they themselves are yet to discover. It's a new system camera that will overturn the paradigm of \u201cdigital cameras.\u201d The SIGMA fp is here to broaden the potential of \u201cimage shooting\u201d ad infinitum. [Key features] 1. World's smallest and lightest full-frame camera With overall dimensions of 112.6\u00d769.9\u00d745.3mm and body weight of 370g, without battery and card, the SIGMA fp is the world's smallest and lightest full-frame mirrorless camera*. It employs a back-illuminated 35mm full-frame Bayer sensor with 24.6 effective megapixels for high-quality images. Covered on the front and back sides with die-cast aluminum alloy for its superior robustness and thermal conductivity, the compact body of the SIGMA fp is built with a signature heat sink structure and sealing on 42 points for a dust- and splash-proof structure, making it a perfect camera to use for long hours under all types of environments. With its small body and great adaptability, the SIGMA fp enhances the joy of full-frame image quality, no matter what one's shooting settings may be. *As of July, 2019. 2. Electronic shutter for a variety of settings \u201cAble to shoot whenever you want, wherever you want\u201d\u2015to realize this concept, the SIGMA fp incorporates a construction without a mechanical shutter for quiet shooting. This allows shooting without worrying about noise in a situation where one would have hesitated with a conventional camera because of its shutter sound. It gives no shutter shock even when shooting in quick succession at a frame rate of 18 frames/sec. eliminating even the tiniest shakes. In addition, the absence of a mechanical shutter, whose performance level can change through continuous operation, means that the SIGMA fp is a camera with improved reliability. 3. Superior options in artistic picture & video creations The SIGMA fp is a frontrunner in incorporating functions that help exploring the photographic and cinematic creations. For instance, in addition to a number of different color modes, the SIGMA fp has newly introduced the \u201cTeal and Orange\u201d mode, inspired by the color grading technique commonly used in Hollywood films. Each mode has a slider that enables adjustment of the strength of the effects to apply, providing even greater control in one's creations. The SIGMA fp is the first SIGMA camera to employ a tone curve adjustment function in addition to \"Fill Light\", a special adjustment function of SIGMA Photo Pro, and they are both available in-camera. It has also newly introduced \"TONE\" and \"COLOR\" buttons for a quick access to each of the tone control and color mode menus. With these enhanced functions and a variety of operation elements, the SIGMA fp makes it simple and easy to create an image, in-camera with great details, be it still or video. 4. Advanced picture & video generating functions The SIGMA fp employs a number of advanced technologies for image and video generation. The Auto HDR function takes advantage of an electronic shutter to take multiple pictures of different exposures (3 frames for still photography and 2 frames for video) at once, which can then be merged into a single picture or video with a great dynamic range that could not have been achieved in normal shooting. The Cinemagraph function, meanwhile, achieves a hybrid between still photography and video in the form of animated GIFs in which parts of a still image keep moving. With this function, the SIGMA fp is capable of creating Cinemagraphs in-camera. Note: The Auto HDR function in the Cine mode and the Cinemagraph function are to become available via firmware update scheduled at a later date. 5. L-Mount The SIGMA fp uses the L-Mount*, characterized by a short flange focal length, large diameter, and superior durability. For interchangeable lenses, in addition to the wide-ranging choices of SIGMA lenses, other manufacturers' lenses can also be an option through the L-Mount Alliance with Leica Camera AG and Panasonic Corporation. With the SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-21, SIGMA SA mount and SIGMA's CANON EF mount lenses can be used, making the best out of one's lens investment. *The L-Mount Trademark is a registered Trademark of Leica Camera AG. 6. Supports full-fledged video production For raw video data, the SIGMA fp supports 12-bit CinemaDNG external recording. With 4K UHD/24fps recording, it produces video data that can be used even in filmmaking. It also supports ALL-I recording which is optimal for editing H.264 compressed videos. For video output, it uses USB3.1(GEN1), which allows a smooth data transmission to an external recording unit. As it also supports cinema camera-like user interfaces, the SIGMA fp is a camera that can be taken straight to video production settings. Note: The feature of playing CinemaDNG footages in-camera is to become available via firmware update scheduled at a later date. 7. Seamless transition between Still and Cine modes Going from the Still mode to the Cine mode at the flip of a switch. Each mode comes with a specially designed operation system and displays, making it possible to concentrate on shooting in each mode, stress-free.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/299161-sigma-fp-%E2%80%93-worlds-smallest-lightest-mirrorless-full-frame-camera/?tab=comments#comment-3775909", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "299161-sigma-fp-%E2%80%93-worlds-smallest-lightest-mirrorless-full-frame-camera", "result": true, "Selector": "[idea, develop]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": " Sigma today announced the sigma fp \u2013 the world's smallest and lightest mirrorless digital camera.

It's a new system camera that will overturn the paradigm of \u201cdigital cameras.\u201d The SIGMA fp is here to broaden the potential of \u201cimage shooting\u201d ad infinitum. [Key features] 1. World's smallest and lightest full-frame camera With overall dimensions of 112.6\u00d769.9\u00d745.3mm and body weight of 370g, without battery and card, the SIGMA fp is the world's smallest and lightest full-frame mirrorless camera*. It employs a back-illuminated 35mm full-frame Bayer sensor with 24.6 effective megapixels for high-quality images. Covered on the front and back sides with die-cast aluminum alloy for its superior robustness and thermal conductivity, the compact body of the SIGMA fp is built with a signature heat sink structure and sealing on 42 points for a dust- and splash-proof structure, making it a perfect camera to use for long hours under all types of environments. With its small body and great adaptability, the SIGMA fp enhances the joy of full-frame image quality, no matter what one's shooting settings may be. *As of July, 2019. 2. Electronic shutter for a variety of settings \u201cAble to shoot whenever you want, wherever you want\u201d\u2015to realize this concept, the SIGMA fp incorporates a construction without a mechanical shutter for quiet shooting. This allows shooting without worrying about noise in a situation where one would have hesitated with a conventional camera because of its shutter sound. It gives no shutter shock even when shooting in quick succession at a frame rate of 18 frames/sec. eliminating even the tiniest shakes. In addition, the absence of a mechanical shutter, whose performance level can change through continuous operation, means that the SIGMA fp is a camera with improved reliability. 3. Superior options in artistic picture & video creations The SIGMA fp is a frontrunner in incorporating functions that help exploring the photographic and cinematic creations. For instance, in addition to a number of different color modes, the SIGMA fp has newly introduced the \u201cTeal and Orange\u201d mode, inspired by the color grading technique commonly used in Hollywood films. Each mode has a slider that enables adjustment of the strength of the effects to apply, providing even greater control in one's creations. The SIGMA fp is the first SIGMA camera to employ a tone curve adjustment function in addition to \"Fill Light\", a special adjustment function of SIGMA Photo Pro, and they are both available in-camera. It has also newly introduced \"TONE\" and \"COLOR\" buttons for a quick access to each of the tone control and color mode menus. With these enhanced functions and a variety of operation elements, the SIGMA fp makes it simple and easy to create an image, in-camera with great details, be it still or video. 4. Advanced picture & video generating functions The SIGMA fp employs a number of advanced technologies for image and video generation. The Auto HDR function takes advantage of an electronic shutter to take multiple pictures of different exposures (3 frames for still photography and 2 frames for video) at once, which can then be merged into a single picture or video with a great dynamic range that could not have been achieved in normal shooting. The Cinemagraph function, meanwhile, achieves a hybrid between still photography and video in the form of animated GIFs in which parts of a still image keep moving. With this function, the SIGMA fp is capable of creating Cinemagraphs in-camera. Note: The Auto HDR function in the Cine mode and the Cinemagraph function are to become available via firmware update scheduled at a later date. 5. L-Mount The SIGMA fp uses the L-Mount*, characterized by a short flange focal length, large diameter, and superior durability. For interchangeable lenses, in addition to the wide-ranging choices of SIGMA lenses, other manufacturers' lenses can also be an option through the L-Mount Alliance with Leica Camera AG and Panasonic Corporation. With the SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-21, SIGMA SA mount and SIGMA's CANON EF mount lenses can be used, making the best out of one's lens investment. *The L-Mount Trademark is a registered Trademark of Leica Camera AG. 6. Supports full-fledged video production For raw video data, the SIGMA fp supports 12-bit CinemaDNG external recording. With 4K UHD/24fps recording, it produces video data that can be used even in filmmaking. It also supports ALL-I recording which is optimal for editing H.264 compressed videos. For video output, it uses USB3.1(GEN1), which allows a smooth data transmission to an external recording unit. As it also supports cinema camera-like user interfaces, the SIGMA fp is a camera that can be taken straight to video production settings. Note: The feature of playing CinemaDNG footages in-camera is to become available via firmware update scheduled at a later date. 7. Seamless transition between Still and Cine modes Going from the Still mode to the Cine mode at the flip of a switch. Each mode comes with a specially designed operation system and displays, making it possible to concentrate on shooting in each mode, stress-free.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 48633, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "jankap", "date": "2019-07-11 15:19:00", "content": "The EVF fails, OK.

I've not made a direct comparison between images acquired with tripod vs handheld and IBIS, but I can say that I would not purchase another camera without it.

The cameras have piqued my interest since announcement but I can't seem to find a consensus opinion on it. For reference, I primarily shoot Sony FE right now (I moved to it after being a M9 shooter nearly exclusively for 4-5 years because I didn't care for the M240). While it's excellent and I have no major issues with the system, I do find myself wanting a few things that they don't readily offer - most of all increased size and second of all a better JPEG engine for when I don't feel like editing. I've tried the new Nikon (didn't care for it and it feels like a step back from the Sony while pretty much being identical in size) and the new Canon (hated the body but loved excellent lenses sans 35 Macro) but they didn't do it for me personally. I tried the Leica SL back in early 2016 at the Leica Store in DC.

I am especially satisfied with the Face recognition on SL when it comes to AF performance. A word of caution on judging AF performance of 3rd party non L mount developed lenses on Panasonic developed DFD AF ( for Lumix & Leicas). Due to the lack of lens specific data stored in cameras, the AF performance will certainly be slow and it will hunt ( character of CDAF before algorithm enhancement). Read reviews and feedback with a pinch of salt. Judge if author is firstly familiar with camera.

You will find the performance of stills AF tracking of S1R performing on par against A7Rlll in a few reviews after firmware 1.0.

Like you, I probably have zero plans to adapt non native lenses unless I plan on manually focusing them nearly exclusively. I\u2019ve done it before with mixed results if depending on AF.

I took two photos out of my studio window at some ships in the distance. The cameras were on the same studio stand. I used the 90mm APO Summicron on the S1 in high resolution mode, and used the Leica S006 with the 120mm APO Macro. I shot both at 5.6. They are approximately the same angle of view, but the S is a bit longer. I used self timer for the S and the regular 2s delay for the S1. In processing the files, I adjusted the exposures and white balances slightly between the cameras to get them to be closer together. I am using the embedded profile for the S and the Camera Standard profile for the S1.

What is clear, however, is that the S1 will generate a very good file. As always, the S006 amazes me with what it can do with a now 10 year old sensor.

Specially focusing on professional use, the LUMIX S Series pursues uncompromising photographic expression with its high-quality cameras and lenses. LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 (S-X50) A large-aperture fixed focal length lens that forms the core of the LUMIX S Series of lenses LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. (S-R70200) A telephoto zoom lens that features high resolution with stunning clarity across the entire zoom range LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. (S-R24105) A versatile standard zoom lens with macro shot capability covering wide-angle to medium telephoto The L-Mount is a lens mount for mirrorless cameras that was launched by Leica and is equally suitable for both the APS-C format and full-frame cameras. Leica Camera, Panasonic and Sigma are set to offer a user-friendly solution that will allow photographers to \u2018mix and match\u2019 any of the three manufacturers\u2019 APS-C and full-frame cameras with any lens from each other\u2019s product portfolios. The aim of the L-Mount Alliance is to provide customers with a diverse and future-proof range of products. The advantages are a large inner diameter of 51.6 mm that enables the realization of extremely fast lenses and extremely compact dimensions. The configuration of the lens-to-camera communication interface is future-proof and the L-Mount also offers an option for the construction of sealed systems that are insensitive to dust and moisture. The L-Mount thereby opens up an almost limitless spectrum of new creative possibilities. All interchangeable lenses of the LUMIX S Series provide high performance yet the \u201cLUMIX S PRO\u201d lenses further boast ultimate optical performance to be certified by LEICA for clearing stringent LEICA standards. Panasonic is committed to designing and developing 10 or more lenses with a focus on \u201cLUMIX S PRO\u201d lenses by 2020 and further expanding the S Series lens lineup. LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 (S-X50) The LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 is a large-aperture fixed focal length LUMIX S PRO lens that nucleates all LUMIX S Series lenses. Ensuring versatile use with its 50mm focal length and F1.4 high speed, the LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 boasts stunningly high resolution and a descriptive performance from the center to the corners of the image despite its large aperture. It provides smooth defocus gradation from the focus peak to the neighboring area of the image. It also describes the point light sources in the background as impressive, beautiful bokeh. The optical performance of this LUMIX S PRO lens is outstandingly high to clear stringent LEICA standards. Comprising 13 lenses in 11 groups, the use of 2 aspherical lenses and 3 ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lenses effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Astigmatism is also corrected with those aspherical lenses, achieving high resolving performance. A double focus system combining a linear motor and stepping motor achieves sensor drive at a maximum speed of 480 fps. It realizes fast, high-precision AF to ensure that you will never miss a photo opportunity. Adoption of a focus clutch mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 also excels in video recording performance with a mechanism that suppresses focus breathing, which was a fatal problem of all interchangeable lenses designed for still image photography. The refined design of the LUMIX S Series provides high operability as a tool for professionals. The rugged dust/splash-resistant* design withstand use under harsh conditions even in 10 degrees below zero for high mobility. The filter diameter is 77mm, with an 11-blade circular aperture diaphragm. *Dust and Splash Resistant does not guarantee that damage will not occur if this lens is subjected to direct contact with dust and water. LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. (S-R70200) The second lens is also a LUMIX S PRO lens. The LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. telephoto zoom lens provides high-resolution, high-contrast images across the entire zoom range. It can be used for wide-ranging situations, from portraits to sports. Panasonic LUMIX\u2019s image stabilization system 5-Axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabilzier) 2*1 can be used with the LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. for the first time as a lens of a full-frame mirrorless camera system, to ensure that you will never miss a photo opportunity. The optical performance of this LUMIX S PRO lens is outstandingly high to clear stringent LEICA standards. The lens unit comprises 23 lenses in 17 groups and the use of an aspherical lens and 3 ED (Extra- low Dispersion) lenses effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Designed in pursuit of optimum lens alignment, it achieves beautiful bokeh with minimum vignetting. The O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) in the lens effectively compensates for the hand-shake movement, making it easy to shoot even without a tripod or in low-lit situations. Complying with the camera\u2019s Body I.S., the 5-Axis Dual I.S. 2*1 makes it possible to use 6-stop slower shutter speed*2. The high-precision linear motor achieves sensor drive at a maximum speed of 480 fps for fast auto focusing. The adoption of a focus clutch mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. also excels in video recording performance with a mechanism that suppresses focus breathing, which was a fatal problem of all interchangeable lenses designed for still image photography.

My Q2 is set to AF-S. Sometimes when I half press to pre focus on an object and followed by full press to take a photo (after recomposing or just focus and fire), the shutter does not fire off. Instead, the camera refocus again. Yet at times, it works well. Shouldn\u2019t be once afs is engaged and prefocus, regardless if I switch point of focus or not, the shutter should fire? Definitely seems a bit strange. I can't make mine do what you're describing. What AF mode are you using? Field, spot, multi-field etc.? Try resetting the camera and see if the issue persists. In fact, I would save its current settings as a User Profile (User Profile>Manage Profiles>Save as Profile) and export it to your SD card (User Profile>Manage Profiles>Export Profiles).

First time Leica owner and loving everything about the Q. I've had my trusty Nikon D7000 with a collection of lenses for just about 7 years now, the starter Nikon D40 for 5 years before that, and was itching to upgrade. My shooting has mostly been street, landscape, 'artistic' and portraits in the past, and definitely have lots of content to shoot living in Brooklyn, NY. I was set on jumping into a Sony A7iii with a 24-105 and a wide angle prime but always came back to the Leica Q in all my research, cost comparing, reading, youtube, etc. Finally just decided just to go for it and give the Q a few months to see if it could work for my style and subject matter of shooting. I figured that worst case, if it couldn't be my only camera, that I would just sell for roughly the same price I paid in a few months. I started watching B&H, Adorama, and MPB used inventory for a few little while and scored a good deal (I think) on a very lightly used Q off of MPB a few weeks back. Ordered the MegaGear Half Case, Glass Screen Protector, B+W XS Pro MRNC Filter, and JFOTO Thumbs-up Grip right away to use with my Peak Design Slide Strap and quickly taped up the microphone and speaker ports. I've taken just shy of 1k pictures now and love how sharp and fast the focus is, handling is exactly what I wanted, size is a huge plus over the DSLR, and overall image quality and color rendition is amazing. I'm a Mechanical Engineer in Product Design as my day job, so of course I am in the middle of designing my own case that has an additional front finger grip, built in thumb grip (a la fuji xt-3), and a few other things. I have a few 3D printers so the idea is to try out the design and ergonomics with 3D printed models first, then when everything is perfect, have it CNC'd out of either aluminum or brass and coated black. I started the design by 3D modeling the Q. Love that a majority of the dimensions are nice whole numbers - exactly how I like to design parts. Now onto designing the bottom half of the case and working through a few iterations. Will update as progress continues.

I also got rid of some Fuji bodies and lenses lying around. And in a lucky turn of events, my dealer said he was expecting a Q2 in 2 days that he could sell to me. So I added my beloved Q to the trade-in pile, and went home to wait for the call. And yesterday I was able to pick up my Q2. It feels liberating and freeing to have one* camera choice. I think in many ways I was happiest when I had just gotten a new M9 and I could only afford one lens. There was no anxiety about what camera or lens to take. No worrying about what if I wished I had a different lens. I made the best use of the one option I had. And I\u2019m really looking forward to that simplicity again. How many of you have done something similar, and are trying to live with just one primary camera/lens? *Ok, I cheated and for now I\u2019m keeping my Sony A7Riii for landscape usage, especially because I have a set of drop in filters for it.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/300784-took-the-plunge-q2-as-%E2%80%98only%E2%80%99-camera/?tab=comments#comment-3808084", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "300784-took-the-plunge-q2-as-%E2%80%98only%E2%80%99-camera", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " (this is my first post, thought i\u2019ve been following these forums for a while now.) on sunday i was organizing all of my cameras and realized yet again i had a ridiculous amount of equipment. so i boxed up most of it and took it to my leica dealer to sell it. the plan was to place an order for aq2, and hang onto just 1 or 2 cameras for a few months until it arrives. so i parted with my m10 and my leica cl systems. i also got rid of some fuji bodies and lenses lying around. and in a lucky turn of events, my dealer said he was expecting a q2 in 2 days that he could sell to me. so i added my beloved q to the trade-in pile, and went home to wait for the call. and yesterday i was able to pick up my q2. it feels liberating and freeing to have one* camera choice. i think in many ways i was happiest when i had just gotten a new m9 and i could only afford one lens. there was no anxiety about what camera or lens to take. no worrying about what if i wished i had a different lens. -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  the best use of the one option -----> i !!!  had. and i\u2019m really looking forward to that simplicity again. how many of you have done something similar, and are trying to live with just one primary camera/lens? *ok, i cheated and for now i\u2019m keeping my sony a7riii for landscape usage, especially because i have a set of drop in filters for it.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 8065, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "davidginNYC", "date": "2019-08-29 16:54:00", "content": "1 hour ago, mbphotox said: you suffer from serious gas You\u2019re correct about that!

I have not done the R winder but I have done other devices with rechargeable cells. I just resurrected my Black and Decker cordless vacuum cleaner, where one of the eight LioN cells had a failed discharge protection circuit and was dead. It goes like this: Open up the battery compartment and see if there are any ID marks on the battery but certainly identify the type of battery (NiCad, NiMH or LioN). Measure the diameter, length and see what sort of connection tabs are on the battery and their location, plus if stated on the dead batteries, their capacity in milli-Amp-Hours. Go to the website of an industrial battery supplier like the Small Battery Company in the UK or internationally Alibaba/AliExpress or RS components and find the nearest or exact replacement battery. In general, you can replace NiCad with the higher capacity NiMH (I have done this in cordless shavers and Oral-B toothbrushes). If you cannot find the exact size, go smaller not larger, you can always pack out a smaller battery with heat resistant foam. If you are replacing NiCad with NiMH, using a slightly smaller battery will be more than compensated by the improved battery chemistry. Once you have the new cells, carefully remove the originals using a desoldering pump or wick, with a soldering iron. Solder in the new cells. Use the best quality solder you can get - cheap solder is a false economy. I use Mundorf silver/gold/tin solder. This is not cheap for a whole roll but you can usually buy smaller quantities of this on eBay. If you are using this, you really need a modern thermostatically controlled soldering iron, due to its higher melting point. While you have the battery pack apart, look to see if there are any electrolytic capacitors present in the charging circuit. These deteriorate with time, worse when not used. These should be replaced, with good quality items (search for high quality capacitors on Google. I generally use Panasonic). There will likely also be electrolytic capacitors in the charger. Deterioration of these can reduce battery life dramatically as they cause charging voltage ripple, which is a battery killer, so as the charger is 15-20 years old, these should be replaced.

The 2x Extender-R isn't quite as good optically as the APO version is, but it will return excellent results depending on the primary lens it is being used with AND the aperture that you're using. The R80/1.4 is likely not the best lens to use with it, particularly wide open ... Ultra-fast lenses like that are rarely at their best wide open. Here are a couple of sample photos I made with it using the CL body and two different lenses: Leica CL + Elmarit-R 135mm + 2x Extender-R ISO 800 @ f/4 @ 1/4k The R135+extender makes a good 3D macro setup. That's at about 5.5 foot distance and near wide open for limited DoF. Note that the model is 1:43 scale and is about 4 inches long. This next little test shows how it looks going from wide open to two stops down with the R180/4 (Elmar-R): Leica CL + Elmar-R 180mm f/4 + 2x Extender-R (wide open aperture) (two stops down) I think the 2x Extender-R is quite a nice performer if you take into account its limitations, and it only cost me $60.

I have all the S lenses (except the 30, for some reason). I prefer the output of the S to anything - on balance. I switched to the X1D for most work due to its size and weight advantage. I find the OOC files less appealing, but that has the upside that I am forced to make them what I want, instead of just admiring the beautiful Leica S rendition and staying close to that. But still, an X1D and three lenses weighs less than an S(007) and 24mm lens (my workhorse). I wish there was a 24mm XCD, but I'm getting used to 21mm and 30mm. I have no interest in the XCD 120 or 135, as at that point, the weight goes up and I already have the (superb) Leica 120 and 180 lenses.

Thank you for your comments! Mark, I believe we have a lot in common and I think a lot of us who are not part of the group-think and prevalent gear trends are silenced by the sheer noise of gear mania. And that is unfortunate. There are few who want to be seen as contrary or not part of the crowd, but I have been that way all my life. Personally, I don't care what anyone uses to create their art. Unfortunately, there are many who don't consider their photography as art. However, they march to their own music as well. Just as the film v digital war still rages, gear wars are even worse it seems. My full-time exposure to Medium Fornat is only a few years, but I have found that I much prefer MF whether it be film or digital. My use of the H5D-50c has amazed me and my clients have appreciated the results as well. Gear selection is a personal thing with many ways to look at it. My preferences have nothing to do with smaller size and lighter weight. If I want snapshots, I always used my M or X1. But I appreciate, and prefer the quality and feel of heavier instruments like the M vs. lighter gear and I am delighted with the size, weight, quality, simplicity and results of both the S cameras and the H system. I am sure Phase One would be on my preferential gear list if I could afford even a used one. Everyone is different of course. For me, at the end of the day, did my gear provide me an experience, including gear aesthetics, that was pleasurable and did the results meet my expectations? My film cameras always have. The H system and the S system both fit my preferences like a well-tailored suit and are as comfortable as a favorite pair of jeans to me. And, the results always astonish me.

Now, while this is of course personal I much prefer to use the EVF rather than the LCD for various reasons, here are some of them: - As a glass wearer, I don't have to change glasses to look at the LCD (near) and then at the real world (far), since the EVF has built-in diopter correction; - In bright daylight, it is much easier to look into the EVF than at the LCD, especially when sun hits the screen; - While you don't like \"jamming the camera against your face\", I much prefer the isolation and concentration coming from working while cutting the rest of the world out of my composing and shooting process; That said, whether one likes to use it or prefer the LCD, there is no doubt in my mind that OVF are a thing of the past for Landscape photography and are much, much less useful and flexible than EVF / LCD. So, if I have to suggest anyone a camera for Landscape photography, everything else being equal and even if that someone is not as single-minded about using the EVF versus the LCD, I would definitely recommend one with EVF against one with OVF. About the quality of the files, I have been using the S007 for six months couple of years ago and I assume you don't do long exposures. If you did, the difference in file quality would be clear to you. IMHO, the X1D's files have much more \"real world\" room for manoeuvre in post-processing than the SL / S files, which I know fairly well having used them for three years (SL) and 6 months (s) day-in, day-out. The amount of (amazingly clean) shadow recovery in the X1D files is something the SL & S simply don't have. About long exposures, again it's a matter of purpose - for my work, the S is simply a no go, since I routinely go for minutes-ling exposures. About wide-angle, again it's a matter of purpose - for my work, the S being limited to 19mm is simply not wide enough, since I routinely go wider than that. So, in the end - as I said in my previous post - it's a matter of thinking purpose-oriented when choosing gear. It sound cold, and it probably goes against what most do, but what I do is: - Make a list of the features I really need; - Look at the camera that can give me those in the best, fastest, less cumbersome way, in the lighter and smaller package; - Buy that system Of course, everyone's purposes are different, everyone requirements are different, and therefore everyone's solution is different. Best regards, Vieri Hi, Vieri, Tbh, I think you could do just fine without the X1D. You could do an excellent job of imaging with anything including a hammer, chisel and stone.:) Your talent and skill is most admirable! I love the design and capability of the X1D. Except for the EVF. I hate those! Just my opinion, like yours in the opposite direction. I could trade for an X1D, but not with the EVF. That is a non/starter for me. And I dislike live view in the sunlight/bright conditions. That said, I look forward to more success for the X1D and its successors even though they are unaffordable for me. But that is my fault, not Hasselblad's. I would like to comment that not all photographers can afford the latest and greatest and I am a lowly bottom-feeder relying on the excellent systems that were the darlings of our community in days and years past. I appreciate the older gear not only for it's lower cost due to extreme depreciation, but because they have much to offer. it is wonderful that new products are always available. However, there is a chilling effect for some of us who read about how awful the older systems are. How the new systems are magically the only way to be a good photographer. I respectfully disagree.:) In my mind, there are more photographers who can benefit from the \"obsolete\" systems than there are those who can afford extremely expensive gear. Yes, photography is expensive, no matter what. But in the age of cell phone cameras and selfie-obsession, we as a community need to nurture a bond across all photographers whether they be professionals, hobbyists, or aspiring artists. Part of nurturing is to maintain those who enjoy photography with whatever gear they use. As you stated, everyone is different. I know I am, and that has been a blessing and a curse all my life, LOL.., but the bottom line is I for one prefer OVF and a simple system.

i love the design and capability of the x1d. except for the evf. i hate those! just my opinion, like yours in the opposite direction. i could trade for an x1d, but not with the evf. that is a non/starter for me. and i dislike live view in the sunlight/bright conditions. that said, i look forward to more success for the x1d and its successors even though they are unaffordable for me. but that is my fault, not hasselblad's. i would like to comment that not all photographers can afford the latest and greatest and i am a lowly bottom-feeder relying on the excellent systems that were the darlings of our community in days and years past. i appreciate the older gear not only for it's lower cost due to extreme depreciation, but because they have much to offer. it is wonderful that new products are always available. however, there is a chilling effect for some of us who read about how awful the older systems are. how the new systems are magically the only way to be a good photographer. i respectfully disagree.:) in my mind, there are more photographers who can benefit from the \"obsolete\" systems than there are those who can afford extremely expensive gear. yes, photography is expensive, no matter what. but in the age of cell phone cameras and selfie-obsession, we as a community need to nurture a bond across all photographers whether they be professionals, hobbyists, or aspiring artists. part of nurturing is to maintain those who enjoy photography with whatever gear they use. as you stated, everyone is different. i know i am, and that has been a blessing and a curse all my life, lol.., but the bottom line is i for one prefer ovf and a simple system. perhaps that makes me a non-starter as a \"good\" or \"professional\" photographer, if so, may -----> i !!!

The problem is not always being very unsharp, it is uneven sharpness...having something going from incredibly sharp on center to slightly unsharp on the edge...in a way, the extremely high performance on center is working against you because it makes you notice the less than perfect performance at the edges. I know for my 30-90mm lens at least, that there is no aperture at which I can get critically sharp edges when longer than about 65mm. It is not a matter of focus, although I do find the focusing pattern of the wide angle lenses to be consistently short in a lot of compositions.

I mean in terms of resulting image, the look of the photo? (leaving out acuity, sharpness fall off, 14/16 bit, AF and all that) I didn't buy SL, but I used it a few times when it first introduced and during I drop my S to Leica Store SF to have them serviced. At that time, I determined it was not good enough for me to spend the money, mainly the ergonomic and EVF and of course file quality are not better than other system I had. It was simply not competitive enough. I also have to admit I was not a fan of EVF based camera. I am still not, but after force myself spend more time with Z7 and PanaS1, I have to say I do enjoy some of benefits they give me and also those implementation are indeed way better than EVF cameras I tried before. Given SL2 will offer native M (which I will never part with) and S support, and I do like most part of Panasonic S1 give me, why not just preorder it. I do have experience from all major FF brand other than Canon. I used Sony A7R up to A7rII and D800 till D850 and now Z7 and Panasonic S1. General speaking, if I have to pick one FF file out of them all, it is D850. Not sharpness but smooth and analog feel of file and robustness of file during process. Z7 might have slightly more sharpness and more vivid color out of LR but it also has more stuff(digital correction) build in RAW files especially using LR. It may look more impressive(digital) on net but just less analog natural feel to the file IMHO. Then, this exact same argument can be applied to comparing S006/007 files to D850 files. I don\u2019t want drag myself into this debate about how superior S files are, especially doing A/B demo that just like I don\u2019t want drag myself deep into debate about S007 and S006 color. (From S006 to S007, there is at least one less reason to stick with S: color. but that is just my personal opinion, I hope S3 correct that) However, I spend too much time working on all the raw files from different manufactures, I brought D850 or Z7 and S006/007 on multiple trips. Worked with those files, I am pretty confident on what I am seeing, and that is enough for me to make decision. I have said about those merits such as tonality, rendering, focus transition etc\u2026many times and it is up to individuals to get it or trust it Or just ignore what I said. I really don\u2019t mind at all. As I mentioned here, in term of technical performance, SL prime seems representing the top performance Leica can achieve. I can see this will be main focus Leica is aiming right now and its superb performances are clearly showed from published MTF curve. SL glasses are technical better than S glasses. I have no argument on that. As a side note, that is also not a news to me, as there are other FF glasses are already better corrected and having better sharpness than S glasses for a while and I also happen to own or owned one or two or a few of those. (Sigma art and OTUS) Even Nikon Z primes are superb at much smaller size and price. But sharpness and color correction are only part of story to contribute final images look, S glasses along with format size and 16 bit are special, special enough for me to take the size, weight and ancient single focus point body over anything else I have used.

I am still not, but after force myself spend more time with Z7 and PanaS1, I have to say I do enjoy some of benefits they give me and also those implementation are indeed way better than EVF cameras I tried before. Given SL2 will offer native M (which I will never part with) and S support, and I do like most part of Panasonic S1 give me, why not just preorder it. I do have experience from all major FF brand other than Canon. I used Sony A7R up to A7rII and D800 till D850 and now Z7 and Panasonic S1. General speaking, if I have to pick one FF file out of them all, it is D850. Not sharpness but smooth and analog feel of file and robustness of file during process. Z7 might have slightly more sharpness and more vivid color out of LR but it also has more stuff(digital correction) build in RAW files especially using LR. It may look more impressive(digital) on net but just less analog natural feel to the file IMHO. Then, this exact same argument can be applied to comparing S006/007 files to D850 files. I don\u2019t want drag myself into this debate about how superior S files are, especially doing A/B demo that just like I don\u2019t want drag myself deep into debate about S007 and S006 color. (From S006 to S007, there is at least one less reason to stick with S: color. but that is just my personal opinion, I hope S3 correct that) However, I spend too much time working on all the raw files from different manufactures, I brought D850 or Z7 and S006/007 on multiple trips. Worked with those files, I am pretty confident on what I am seeing, and that is enough for me to make decision. I have said about those merits such as tonality, rendering, focus transition etc\u2026many times and it is up to individuals to get it or trust it Or just ignore what I said. I really don\u2019t mind at all. As I mentioned here, in term of technical performance, SL prime seems representing the top performance Leica can achieve. I can see this will be main focus Leica is aiming right now and its superb performances are clearly showed from published MTF curve. SL glasses are technical better than S glasses. I have no argument on that. As a side note, that is also not a news to me, as there are other FF glasses are already better corrected and having better sharpness than S glasses for a while and I also happen to own or owned one or two or a few of those. (Sigma art and OTUS) Even Nikon Z primes are superb at much smaller size and price. But sharpness and color correction are only part of story to contribute final images look, S glasses along with format size and 16 bit are special, special enough for me to take the size, weight and ancient single focus point body over anything else I have used. I really don\u2019t have any use for anything sharper than S glasses. They are enough. Again, if we just sit down and do paper analysis, then, no joke, A7RIV seems a perfect solution for that matter. I'm in full agreement with what Micheal said above. I have been using S2 with a set of S lenses (35/75/120/180) for about 5 years and earlier this year I started using SL with SL lenses (24-90 and 50/1.4). I must admit that the SL lenses are excellent, but they have very different look compared with both M and S lenses. To my eyes, SL lenses have very modern look and very digital, where as S lenses have more pleasing look and smoother color transitions. For me, S lenses are special and I am looking forward to seeing what the new S3 will bring.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/303261-can-the-new-sl-compete-or-even-sostitute-in-some-fields-the-s/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3851619", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "303261-can-the-new-sl-compete-or-even-sostitute-in-some-fields-the-s", "result": true, "Selector": "me to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " 4 hours ago, zhnl said: i didn't buy sl, but i used it a few times when it first introduced and during i drop my s to leica store sf to have them serviced. at that time, i determined it was not good enough for me to spend the money, mainly the ergonomic and evf and of course file quality are not better than other system i had. it was simply not competitive enough. i also have to admit i was not a fan of evf based camera. i am still not, but after force myself spend more time with z7 and panas1, i have to say i do enjoy some of benefits they give me and also those implementation are indeed way better than evf cameras i tried before. given sl2 will offer native m (which i will never part with) and s support, and i do like most part of panasonic s1 give me, why not just preorder it. i do have experience from all major ff brand other than canon. i used sony a7r up to a7rii and d800 till d850 and now z7 and panasonic s1. general speaking, if i have to pick one ff file out of them all, it is d850. not sharpness but smooth and analog feel of file and robustness of file during process. z7 might have slightly more sharpness and more vivid color out of lr but it also has more stuff(digital correction) build in raw files especially using lr. it may look more impressive(digital) on net but just less analog natural feel to the file imho. then, this exact same argument can be applied to comparing s006/007 files to d850 files. i don\u2019t want drag myself into this debate about how superior s files are, especially doing a/b demo that just like i don\u2019t want drag myself deep into debate about s007 and s006 color.

Considering getting rid of my S body and three lenses for the SL2 - as I am also an SL owner and have invested in the L Mount system also across Lumix and Sigma (as of Sunday I also have the Sigma fp). So I have a great deal more L mount lenses and adapters than I do most anything else. I also have a Pentax 645Z as a medium format backup to my S, and that is larger or the same resolution as the SL2 at 50MP. Here is what I think... If you want a fast mirrorless camera with high resolution up to 3200 ISO (more on this later), you want to use a WIDE variety of lenses including RF lenses that are \"almost\" as good as on an M, and you want to print large or do some streaming video at 4-5K with IBIS handheld but with an external monitor (no flippy screen), then the SL2 is your camera. Not the equally high MP S1R, not the original SL, not the FP, not the S1H - the SL2. It's \"good enough\" for all of that, if not best in class... for what it is. But that ISN'T what the S system is. Leica made the S as a competitor to Hasselblad when Dr. Kaufman couldn't buy it more or less. It was, like many things in Leica's history, a first of its kind - a sort of hybrid DSLR and Medium Format product that had the same crop factor as 35MM film and a larger sensor. The S STILL remains UNIQUE on the landscape of Medium Format digital cameras for a few reasons. Its philosophy is rather different than the Sony, Fuji, and yes now even Leica 2019 market. Up until very recently, Leica unlike all of its competitors, was exceptionally conservative with its technology choices - preferring to optimize quality over \"features\" and made very unique offerings that were \"luxury-like\", but still very reliable to the small group of people that would use them. Think of Apple before essentially beat the shit out of Microsoft, those of us in design and photography still used them, but you wouldn't see the Apple logo on every single table of every single coffeehouse in every single town across the world. We knew that we were paying for the logo, but what that meant was we were also paying for the \"better\" experience - which was proven later when everyone wanted one. When Apple decided to make a successful line of laptops for pros and everyone and then the iPhone and iPad. Leica, for better or for worse, is on that path with its L mount line. The S... well it's a \"Mac Pro\". You pay a premium, the device has a shelf life, isnt really modular (neither is the Fuji GX series) and well, you get a solid camera that you can use for years that performs what its CORE value is in the way it was designed. The S isnt a system for everyone. It's not meant to be. Now, from what I have heard on who this system is aimed at - the pro or hobbyist with deep pockets that could afford a say Hassy or a Phase One system - that market is not exactly suffering. The IQ of the current S when put up against higher MP backs of its same generation like the Phase IQ 50 or the Sony designed 50MP because of the lenses if not market competitive, on the IQ front is equal if not better. How do I know? Because the folks in my group of working pros and I have shot the same things with their systems and I get a very unique look with my S - Both the CCD and CMOS varieties. The lenses, as has been said here, are not the technically *perfect* L mount Leica variety - but they are absolutely UNIQUE on the market. No there isnt OIS, but there is a leaf style shutter, no there isn't APOCHROMATIC perfection - but do you ALWAYS want a perfect clean image, every single time (?), no the AF isn't the fastest - but with that optical VF you can hit your focus unless you just can't see. It's handling is great. its menu system is FAST. Is it as fast as a mirrorless? No. Is it as fast as a DSLR? No. Does it matter to most of its customers? No, not at all. We who want an S know what we are getting into with the S. I'm a photographer, I'm not personally competing with some engineers at some camera company. I'm making images. Thats all I want to *focus* on. Now, that said. I think its absolutely essential that you know what you want out of your camera system (s). I personally want a M to be like the M10, but don't hate the M240/M246. I don't know if I want more than 24 MP on a Full Frame sensor. I like having high ISO options instead of fast glass. I like to get my focus fast. I like the \"just right\" MP of a 24MP sensor on a FF camera. I like the SL typ 601 because it has that style of sensor and I can use more than just the L mount lenses and feel like I have an optimized sensor. I think that the 47 MP sensor may even be BETTER for M lenses, for some applications, but I like going the ISO 6400 and beyond with the \"smaller cameras\". But do I need or want high resolution on a FF when I have a larger sensor camera or cameras for that? Maybe if the SL were my ONLY precision SLR, I may want the higher MP. maybe if I needed or wanted some of its features. I also don't rely or even like autofocus that much, on ANY camera... so the SL is a different tool for me. I want to use my existing lenses. I have what I need. I am interested but not quite ready to upgrade (but I may do it anyway, we will see). The M is the perfect FF camera for the type of work I like to do with an M, and the SL has always been used as the Swiss-German Army Knife for everything else with a fast shutter when I needed that. Owning a Leica has meant that you don't HAVE to update your body when a new one comes out, only if you WANT to. How many original SL's will stay in use? How many S2/S typ 006 are still being used? What you have is the best of its class at the time and onward. Hell, I even still shoot the M8, M9, original Monochrom if the look requires it. We will update when we update, get what we need when it seems like we need it. Its an illusion that we need anything else to make what we make in 2019. That said... The S... well, the S is my *money shot*. I have gotten images out of the S I could NEVER get with any other system. That was worth the price of admission, and also worth the depreciation, which has been incredibly fast. Because 37MP has been good since 2009, and will be good until I decide to upgrade to 64/100/whatever, its fine for MOST things, and my lenses will still be some of the best in the business until we move entirely to computational photography (and when that happens, I am happy to have my *legacy* Leica tech). We had issues with AF in the S lenses for some time, I think mostly that has been addressed since like 2017. The S3 update looks to be a good one, and although there are \"technical\" details being perfected in Wetzlar, I don't mind waiting. Hell, I may not even update for some time. And if I get the SL2, well I might go ahead and get that S adapter L too, because I like my S lenses that much. I used it on the SL 2 and the AF was excellent. it will crop in but maybe that's ok. Last thought: Do we always need the latest tech to get the best images? I don't think so, I just think we need the best for what it is and for how we want to shoot. You can choose to keep up with it, or you can just make the best images you can with the best equipment you have.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/303261-can-the-new-sl-compete-or-even-sostitute-in-some-fields-the-s/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-3855396", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "303261-can-the-new-sl-compete-or-even-sostitute-in-some-fields-the-s", "result": true, "Selector": "i'm making", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i was really considering this topic. considering getting rid of my s body and three lenses for the sl2 - as i am also an sl owner and have invested in the l mount system also across lumix and sigma (as of sunday i also have the sigma fp). so i have a great deal more l mount lenses and adapters than i do most anything else. i also have a pentax 645z as a medium format backup to my s, and that is larger or the same resolution as the sl2 at 50mp. here is what i think... if you want a fast mirrorless camera with high resolution up to 3200 iso (more on this later), you want to use a wide variety of lenses including rf lenses that are \"almost\" as good as on an m, and you want to print large or do some streaming video at 4-5k with ibis handheld but with an external monitor (no flippy screen), then the sl2 is your camera. not the equally high mp s1r, not the original sl, not the fp, not the s1h - the sl2. it's \"good enough\" for all of that, if not best in class... for what it is. but that isn't what the s system is. leica made the s as a competitor to hasselblad when dr. kaufman couldn't buy it more or less. it was, like many things in leica's history, a first of its kind - a sort of hybrid dslr and medium format product that had the same crop factor as 35mm film and a larger sensor. the s still remains unique on the landscape of medium format digital cameras for a few reasons. its philosophy is rather different than the sony, fuji, and yes now even leica 2019 market. up until very recently, leica unlike all of its competitors, was exceptionally conservative with its technology choices - preferring to optimize quality over \"features\" and made very unique offerings that were \"luxury-like\", but still very reliable to the small group of people that would use them. think of apple before essentially beat the shit out of microsoft, those of us in design and photography still used them, but you wouldn't see the apple logo on every single table of every single coffeehouse in every single town across the world. we knew that we were paying for the logo, but what that meant was we were also paying for the \"better\" experience - which was proven later when everyone wanted one. when apple decided to make a successful line of laptops for pros and everyone and then the iphone and ipad. leica, for better or for worse, is on that path with its l mount line. the s... well it's a \"mac pro\". you pay a premium, the device has a shelf life, isnt really modular (neither is the fuji gx series) and well, you get a solid camera that you can use for years that performs what its core value is in the way it was designed. the s isnt a system for everyone. it's not meant to be. now, from what i have heard on who this system is aimed at - the pro or hobbyist with deep pockets that could afford a say hassy or a phase one system - that market is not exactly suffering. the iq of the current s when put up against higher mp backs of its same generation like the phase iq 50 or the sony designed 50mp because of the lenses if not market competitive, on the iq front is equal if not better. how do i know? because the folks in my group of working pros and i have shot the same things with their systems and i get a very unique look with my s - both the ccd and cmos varieties. the lenses, as has been said here, are not the technically *perfect* l mount leica variety - but they are absolutely unique on the market. no there isnt ois, but there is a leaf style shutter, no there isn't apochromatic perfection - but do you always want a perfect clean image, every single time (?), no the af isn't the fastest - but with that optical vf you can hit your focus unless you just can't see. it's handling is great. its menu system is fast. is it as fast as a mirrorless? no. is it as fast as a dslr? no. does it matter to most of its customers? no, not at all. we who want an s know what we are getting into with the s. i'm a photographer, i'm not personally competing with some engineers at some camera company. -----> i !!!

Right, can we just be like the old days and *know* our systems to the point to where we accept their very minimal imperfections and MAYBE even utilize them? For someone choosing over an SL2 and a S typ 007, I would say - rent or borrow BOTH and shoot them BOTH and see which one has the IMAGE QUALITY you want. You can evidently pick up an S on the used market for about what you would spend on a SL2 and 24-90 L, maybe even less. Get the 70 (50 equivalent) and you have a system that isnt THAT heavy and you have medium format quality in a Leica. All this said, if full frame is fine for what you do, you are totally imbedded in the Leica ecosystem of lenses (or even M mount) then the SL2 is a no brainer. But if you want to have something you won't mid keep using as a primary camera for a decade... the S is one of those cameras. I support Leica going forward, but I also know that we got something badass for what it was at the time. The best of the tech at the price point. Oh, and as for the VIDEO on the S typ 007, I know a lot of people *scoffed* at the specs at first. I will refute that. I shot some close up scenes with it AS IS, hand held in 4K. Some of the best footage I had. I also used TWO SL1s on that same shoot. This was a year or so ago. I just took the unused footage and made a little montage story and I have to say, it holds up. Contrasty, and maybe not what a video editor wants all the time, but its a *look* and in that it is A-OK. I more look forward to what the S3 can do with full frame video with its LARGE sensor and lenses than the FF SL2, with 100MPS and all of the current bevy of functions. Not that I wouldn't be happy with it. If people really want that fully functioning professional cinematic video they likely won't choose an SL2, they will go for the S1H if they want to stick with L mount glass. I don't like the Lumix S1H color science, although for professional settings it is the only Mirrorless that is spec at Netflix. It might be a better option for people that want that. For a cinematographer that wants a directors viewfinder and on set camera, I think the SL2 is a fine hybrid video camera!

I would propose this: Leica has tried to develop a 'flagship' brand. By that I mean they have tried to become the best of each type of camera. Sure, it was simpler when it was only 35mm film - and each successive body type had a different market and different user. If you look at the most reliable mechanically, you would probably come up with something like: Leica IIIC, Leica M3, Leica MP. Then there were the unique: Leica M2R, Leica MD and others. Finally there were some that were more affordable: Leica M2, M4 and M6. (don't critique me too much here - I did this off the cuff to show a point). So, today we have the Leica M series which is advertised as the most compact 35mm, full frame (and full frame film) body because of the rangefinder (mirrorless) and with the highest quality images in the smallest possible packages (i.e., small lenses with great image quality). Then, we have the SL market with mirrorless that has provided some new outstanding primes, small, same filter size and incredible images and focusing speed compared to other lenses. Leica opened up the mount and so there are others in the market, but probably some 'flagship' lenses at least. Finally, we have the S series which is clearly a 'flagship' in the medium format market. The image quality of the S has been incredible since the first model and the lenses have not only great optical quality, but also larger f/stops (smaller numbers) than the other manufacturers. Focus speed and motors were not the focus, (no pun intended) because the medium format was not geared towards sporting events and documentary work. Also, the S lenses have this central shutter concept which is perfect for studio lighting. While other brands have that too, Leica built it in their high quality lenses to ensure all medium format users might find the lenses they need. The Leica Q falls somewhere between the M and SL I think, but the other Leica models - Dlux, Clux, V, X, and to some extent the CL are branches into reasonable camera systems, but not nearly as competitive as other brands. In summary, I think we have 3 (maybe 4) 'flagship' models of cameras with Leica - all for different purposes, but stellar in their field. So, the M for documentary, travel, small size, the SL for fast autofocus and multiple lens attachments (M, S, Nikon, Canon) and the S with incredible medium format capabilities and brighter lenses to focus with (2, 2.5 and 2.8 apertures). That is why I believe the S3 will come and will be great when it does. Leica has typically delayed the S in order to fine tune the sensor output. The SL and the now seen M10-monochrom use very similar sensor size and pixel density. The S has the same density, but a larger size - but the S is known for images that need very little touchup to use, if exposed under proper lighting.

(don't critique me too much here - i did this off the cuff to show a point). so, today we have the leica m series which is advertised as the most compact 35mm, full frame (and full frame film) body because of the rangefinder (mirrorless) and with the highest quality images in the smallest possible packages (i.e., small lenses with great image quality). then, we have the sl market with mirrorless that has provided some new outstanding primes, small, same filter size and incredible images and focusing speed compared to other lenses. leica opened up the mount and so there are others in the market, but probably some 'flagship' lenses at least. finally, we have the s series which is clearly a 'flagship' in the medium format market. the image quality of the s has been incredible since the first model and the lenses have not only great optical quality, but also larger f/stops (smaller numbers) than the other manufacturers. focus speed and motors were not the focus, (no pun intended) because the medium format was not geared towards sporting events and documentary work. also, the s lenses have this central shutter concept which is perfect for studio lighting. while other brands have that too, leica built it in their high quality lenses to ensure all medium format users might find the lenses they need. the leica q falls somewhere between the m and sl i think, but the other leica models - dlux, clux, v, x, and to some extent the cl are branches into reasonable camera systems, but not nearly as competitive as other brands. in summary, i think we have 3 (maybe 4) 'flagship' models of cameras with leica - all for different purposes, but stellar in their field. so, the m for documentary, travel, small size, the sl for fast autofocus and multiple lens attachments (m, s, nikon, canon) and the s with incredible medium format capabilities and brighter lenses to focus with (2, 2.5 and 2.8 apertures). that is why i believe the s3 will come and will be great when it does. leica has typically delayed the s in order to fine tune the sensor output. the sl and the now seen m10-monochrom use very similar sensor size and pixel density. the s has the same density, but a larger size - but the s is known for images that need very little touchup to use, if exposed under proper lighting. sorry for rambling, does anyone think this makes sense or have i gone off the deep end?", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 29743, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "LeicaR10", "date": "2019-08-24 04:35:00", "content": "Yudafu2, I have owned/own the S system cameras since 2009. I currently use the S007 for my pro landscape work and have many of the S lenses (4+ years). Like you, I tried the Fuji and Hasselblad X1D and associated lenses mainly because I wanted to take the medium format cameras on long-distance and remote hikes. I found my clients did not like the rendering of either the Fuji or Hasselblad systems and they voted with their wallets. It wasn't a color management, etc., that was the issue, it is simply the way the Leica S lenses draw. So, I sold the other systems and I went back to the S007 system and my clients are happy. As far as sensor of the other cameras, that did not play a factor for me. It is always photograph content that is key to separating a mere photo from a photograph that makes a person; Stop, Look, Think and if possible Feel, with feeling being the most difficult IMO to convey. As for the shutter being better, Yes it is better than previous S cameras. But for my work, I always use a tripod and don't handhold the camera. I have written other posts here on the S blog about my experience with the other systems and going back to the S. Personally, I like the user interface of the S and other Leica cameras too; i.e., simple and intuitive. It always gets down to two things anyways...shutter speed and f/stop the rest IMO is gravy. A drawback for me, the S camera weight became an issue for me hiking 20-30 KM a day in mountains at my age to be challenging. What I did to resolve my hiking/camera weight issue was to use the S camera for short distance hikes 0-10 KM and take S lenses that I think will help me create the photographs that I envision. I use the SL system for the long-distance hikes and M system for really challenging remote hikes. For me and my clients, the S system is superb and at least I have alternatives as well with the SL and M to help me get to the places I need to go to capture that moment in time.

I find the \"speculation\" as you put it is an important part of planning my future equipment for my business....will the S3 be a refresh for the system, or the last hurrah as they move forward with a different style of cameras like the SL.

At least I will be able to use the lenses. P.S. The great street prices are also not so great if you bought your cameras new and at or near retail price.

I think this is primarily a function of lens focal length and tonality. I think the same advantages that applied in the days of film still apply today. You might be able to take tech pan in a 35mm camera and make an extremely sharp, grainless negative, but it still does not have the feel of an image from a larger format. When I bought into the Leica S, I sold a Leica R kit and a Nikon DSLR kit, as well as some MF film gear to cover the cost. The s2 was far beyond anything 35mm offered at the time, and I loved the color and capabilities it had. It was like nothing I had shot before on digital. I am still using basically the same camera 8 years later, though I bumped up to the 006 after the 007 came out. Aside from the results, the lenses and ergonomics are much better than anything else that was available when I bought them. The combination of reliable focus (for me, though I know others do not agree), perfect weather sealing, easily handling in the dark and with even mittens, as well as the well thought out interface and beautiful viewfinder mean that it is hard to take much pleasure out of using 35mm mirrorless cameras, all of which feel in some way compromised to me compared to the S. Even the GFX felt clunky to me in comparison. These days, lens makers have really upped their game, and I feel like some of the lenses available now match or exceed some of the S lenses...for example the SL lenses of course, as well as the lenses for the GFX, X1D and things like the Sigma Art lenses (which I have not used, but have some incredible MTF and reviews). Still, I think if the S3 is a big improvement over the S007, then the S system will continue to be one of the best all around camera systems available, albeit at a very high price. I should also note that my perspective on file quality is that of an exhibition printer, and rarely do I ever see anything better than what the S006 can produce. Even Phase One cameras don't seem to look as nice if people just give me the files with default sharpening and less than perfect technique. They are certainly capable of besting the S, but I do not think they look as nice right out of camera. This of course just based on a fairly limited sample group.

My family and I travelled to Tuscany for just over two weeks in May. The S 007 along as my walk-about with the 70, 35 and Contax 120. And that included the 463 step schlep up a very old, claustrophobic and twisted stair case up to the top of the dome. Security is tight. I put my case on the table and pulled out the S with 70mm attached. The guard looked at it, then me, then it and said \"macchina interessante.\" Then he gestured his colleague over. A man of fewer words, the guard, just said \"bella.\" So the newly christened Bella and I made our way towards the heavens. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate to have \"named\" Bella in the Baptistry building. But, the cathedral was a solid alternative. This is my first travel excursion with the 007, having shot the 006 for three years or so. It is a more flexible camera in virtually every respect. Faster, quieter and with a shooting envelope that extends well beyond the practical reach of the 006, which I rarely shot, in color, over 800, and mostly at base ISO. Conversely, I could shoot the 007 all day long at 3200/6400 with outstanding results. The extended shooting range allowed me to capture interior images, especially in churches, that would have been impossible, hand-held, with the 006. Part of it, is the quieter shutter. Definitely a difference. Now, I am still trying to warm up to the cooler sensor qualities vs the 006. To be sure, it presents a more clinical look - rather like what I get from the Q. But the files are extraordinarily malleable. I was amazed to bring back to life duds that needed three additional stops. And one image looked lost through overexposure. And taking two stops out made it presentable. It feels almost like cheating. One thing I prefer with the 006 is how you can set it to A and then adjust the shutter speed or aperture opening using the two dials. At least, that is how I recall doing it (been a while since I fired it up). But in A with the S 007, seems to me that it does not work the same way - and that adjusting one will cause the camera to compensate by automatically changing the other to maintain what it thinks is the right exposure. So I had to go into the Exposure comp, which is a bit of a pain, and I never know how it gets what it gets - ISO vs. shutter vs aperture. Can anyone suggest a workaround so that I can have the camera in A, and then use the two right dials independently. I would typically have the camera in A, shoot, and then adjust manually to taste. I did find that the 007 auto focus seemed to hunt more than the 006, with the 70mm. Have others had that experience? I did discover that my camera does not like the latest Lexar card with the fast transfer speed. Images had all kind of electronic distortion. So I went back to my trusty SanDisk cards which worked flawlessly. All in all, the trip validated my decision to add Bella to the collection. But there will surely be times when the shoot calls for the magic of a CCD sensor. And that is when Bella's sister will come out.

Unfortunately, with dealers it is mostly better to just sell it yourself on the open market, as they of course need to have enough mark up to make it worth their money. Sometimes it is better to just save the effort and let them deal with the resale, but in the case of this sort of equipment, the difference is often in the thousands of dollars, which for me at least, is enough to make me prefer to sell direct. I have gotten burned before though. I kept my S2 while I converted to the 006, as I wanted to make sure it was working properly before I sold it, and the by the time I got ready to sell it its value had gone from around 7000 dollars to 4000 or less. I still have it, and it is now worth what, 2500 dollars? Unfortunately I recall reading about a business concept where a sharp loss tends to make people not want to sell, when in reality in certain cases it is better to cut your losses as soon as possible, as in all likelihood if you hang onto it, it will continue to lose more and more value.

Historically, 37.5mp is enough for medium format. Especially with a larger sensor, it compares very well to 645 and even 6x7 (where the S is finer grained or grainless and its detail is sharper, though it may not have quite as much detail in certain circumstances, and film still enlarges more gracefully in the extreme sizes, based on the difference in rendering). With respect to general use as well, 37.5mp is enough for most users. For example a lot of fashion or portrait photographers might appreciate the look of lenses, color and tonality more than they might in a 35mm camera, while not really worrying much about resolution. They do not often have to print much larger than a magazine spread, or for commercial displays which often have quite a long viewing distance. But when it comes to art photography, landscape work and areas of commercial work that expect larger enlargements, then 37.5 can certainly be increased. 64mp is very welcome in that sense, and indeed, with all else being equal, more resolution tracks with more quality...it means less moire, better tonality, better microcontrast, finer grain, more ability to crop and better color fidelity. All else being equal is the operative phrase here. Of course, the 007, 006 and S2 are great cameras and will continue to be once the S3 is released. It is a bit foolhardy, however, to ignore the fact that there are many less expensive cameras that can outresolve them, outdo them in high ISO performance and so on. Technology keeps moving on and it does not tend to spare Leica and their 4-7 year MF sensor cycle. Yes that is what I noticed.

Not in the way it handles ergonomically, which is all very familiar, but once the S007 is in your hands you feel that this is the second, much more sophisticated iteration. The mirror and the shutter are a lot quieter than the S2-P and they sound like they were made for hundreds of thousands of effortless exposures. I love my S2-P but the mechanics of this newer S007 feel and sound much more reassuring and the same goes for the autofocus which is noticeably faster. Not that I care much for faster autofocus, I'd rather have more accuracy.When it comes to colours, I have a feeling that the out of the box colours from the CCD sensor are more friendly to my eyes than the newer CMOS 007. For instance in my test shots, blue skies have a tendency to be some more cyan-ish on the S007 than the S2-CCD. Maybe that's just my eyes, I don't know. But anyway, there was nothing going on color-wise, that could not be easily corrected or altered to taste in Lightroom, the files are extremely malleable. People on this forum who have experience with the Leica M240 will know what I mean when I talk about the difference between the M240 and the M9 colours. Actually, that is one of my problems with the S007, it's a very good camera and a very good sensor, but it is 5-6 year old sensor technology.I was very pleasantly surprised by how good 3200 ISO is. I am used to the look of the high ISO shots I make with the Sony RX1M2 which I use for reportage work and that camera has the same 42-Mpix full-frame CMOS sensor as the Sony A7R II, but the noise on the Leica S007 looks a whole lot more friendly and grain-like. The noise on the S007 is just so much softer and nicer to look at, not as harsh and contrasty as on a reasonably well sharpened Sony sensor file.As for for the choice between an S3 and an S007, I (try to) sell fine art prints of my work and I'd really like to be able to make larger prints and that's where the 64MP from the S3 will come in very handy, the reason why I am a little bit on the fence right now about which camera to choose. And although I must say that I think I could be very happy with the S007 because it is really a big step up from my S2-P, the extra 26,5 megapixels from an S3 would be nice to play with. And at the moment there are rumors (just rumors I need to emphasize) that the all new S3 will not be as expensive as the first S system cameras when they came to market because of the strong competition from Hasselblad and Fuji, around 10 to 15 thousand. So right now I'm leaning towards waiting for just a little bit longer to find out what the price difference will be.I crossposted my original question (and some of my replies) and I also asked here over at LuLa, not just for laughs, but hoping I\u2019d get some replies from people who are not Leica-biased, so to speak. Unfortunately, the usual suspects (the same people that 2-5 years ago when I used to frequent LuLa more often, in every thread told everyone that medium format was dead and had, since the arrival of the Nikon 850, no significant role to play anymore in 21st century photography) came in and started talking about so called 'Leica jewellery\u2019.Anyway, the outcome was as always: \"no one in his right mind would buy a Leica now that we should all be celebrating the second coming of JC Fujifilm GFX cameras with their 43.8 x 32.9mm sensors and how Fuji glass is such a good investment, especially with the hundred megapixel sensor coming this summer and anyone who chooses otherwise is just not in their right mind, or a complete idiot and doesn't know anything about photography anyway.\" Actually there were some interesting replies there too, but I can understand why there is so little traffic on their medium format sub forum nowadays. Why the hell every other thread about any given medium format equipment has to be turned into a Fuji-thread, I really don't know. Is it really true than that people only look at spec sheets and prices, I wonder? I decided, instead of replying and tell them exactly how I think about their prejudiced responses, to use my energy in a more constructive way for myself by taking a really good look at the Fujis and so I downloaded a dozen files, imported them into Lightroom (I first needed to convert them to DNG) and take a really good look.Man, am I glad I invested in my Leica S system equipment. I know it's all personal, but from what I saw, I must say that I don't like the Fuji lenses with their harsh specular highlights and awful bokeh, I don't like the Fuji colours, and I don't like the files coming from the Sony sensor, which to me is too much of a step back to the quality of the files from my Sony RX1M2, just a little bit bigger. Oh, and I don't care for 4:3, I like to crop and print wide, so there are millions of pixels wasted for me on the 4:3 aspect ratio. Once I started sharpening the Fuji test files and applied my usual Leica S2-P sharpening settings I got the feeling that the images started falling apart and they started looking very brittle to my eye. So I consider this to be a good thing, because although it took me a few hours to find out, I have for now made it clear to myself that I have no interest in the Fuji-hype. So where do I go from here? I don't know, the money will stay in the bank for now and I will look at the Panasonic and the upcoming Leica SL2 options, but I feel that what I really want at the moment is just wait and see how the S3 is going to fare.

But here are my strong preferences, based on my extensive use of the S tethered (and more recently, the SL also): (a) Fix the Tethered Plugin for Lightroom. Leica know it is broken; they even say so on the download page in the owners' area (\"Changing camera user profiles in the camera during tethered connection could lead to a software crash and/ or an image loss! Solution: User profiles should not be changed when the camera is connected to the computer!\"). The plugin allows you to select an import preset but it never applies it. This is a significant impediment - when shooting in a studio, I always shoot tethered and I want me and my team to see how the images are coming out. Not only that, some of the presets apply compression of shadows or highlights and I want to be sure, at the time of capture, that I am not loosing any detail to under or overexposure. If the theme of the shoot is \"high contrast black and white\", for example, I want the images to come up on the screen with a high contrast BW preset applied. If I am shooting a theme with a \"film look\", I want the images to show up with whatever film preset I have decided to use (say Mastin Labs Portra 160). The Leica version of the plugin just does not apply these presets, even if you select them, which is infuriating. I notified Leica about the problem on 2nd February 2017 - they still haven't fixed it. The contact person on the email was Thomas Schmidt. Characteristically, the Fuji version of the plugin, which looks exactly the same, applies all the presets as selected, no problemo. Mr. Schmidt, if you are reading this, can you please explain why the Fuji plugin works and the exactly same-looking Leica plugin doesn't? Apart from this, the Fuji cameras now tether directly in Capture One, which is a faster and more reliable tethering solution than Lightroom. Of course, one can use whatever presets in C1 during tethering with the Fuji cameras, so they come up on the screen with the preset applied. The Leica work-around (using Image Shuttle and setting a hot folder in C1) is not great because, of course,....no prizes for guessing..... it doesn't allow me to apply any import preset...so the files just show on the screen with the \"generic DNG\" profile, and not with the \"Spring Collection preset No. 2\" applied. (b) Use the Lemo connector, same as on the S cameras, also on the SL2. Do not use the stupid generic USB 3 connector that's on the SL. Why? Because, like in all so equipped cameras (including the D850, GFX50S to name just a few) the tether cable just keeps getting loose and forces us to use various \"jerk stoppers\" and other assorted stupid contraptions, just to keep the cable connected. The Lemo connector on the S is a thing of beauty, it just plugs in and stays connected (thank you Leica for using Lemo on the S cameras). So please use the Lemo connector on the SL2. (c) It would be nice to offer some profiles - Phase One provides (offers for sale) various development presets, looks, that can be applied in C1, to get to a more advanced starting point, with grading applied, while shooting. Fuji famously provides the film simulation import presets (Acros with green filter, anyone?). Whereas all we get from Leica is the Adobe looks (we used to get the \"Embedded\" also, whatever that was, but it seems to have disappeared in the most recent versions of Lightroom). Would it be so difficult to give us some nice Agfa APX 100 or RSX presets, for example (to keep it all \"at home\", so to speak)? Staying in Germany, could Leica perhaps collaborate with https://www.basiccolor.de to offer specific presets for various light sources? I forked out the full price for the basiccolor solution and it ended up in a frustration: the profiles generated by the software did not look right, too much red etc. (I am sure I made a mistake somewhere but perhaps Leica could do this right for us, properly, just like Phase One do in their \"Cultural Heritage\" package, where every back comes with a super-precise set of colour profiles). It is not strictly necessary for me, but I would love such an offering from Leica.

(b) use the lemo connector, same as on the s cameras, also on the sl2. do not use the stupid generic usb 3 connector that's on the sl. why? because, like in all so equipped cameras (including the d850, gfx50s to name just a few) the tether cable just keeps getting loose and forces us to use various \"jerk stoppers\" and other assorted stupid contraptions, just to keep the cable connected. the lemo connector on the s is a thing of beauty, it just plugs in and stays connected (thank you leica for using lemo on the s cameras). so please use the lemo connector on the sl2. (c) it would be nice to offer some profiles - phase one provides (offers for sale) various development presets, looks, that can be applied in c1, to get to a more advanced starting point, with grading applied, while shooting. fuji famously provides the film simulation import presets (acros with green filter, anyone?). whereas all we get from leica is the adobe looks (we used to get the \"embedded\" also, whatever that was, but it seems to have disappeared in the most recent versions of lightroom). would it be so difficult to give us some nice agfa apx 100 or rsx presets, for example (to keep it all \"at home\", so to speak)? staying in germany, could leica perhaps collaborate with https://www.basiccolor.de to offer specific presets for various light sources? i forked out the full price for the basiccolor solution and it ended up in a frustration: the profiles generated by the software did not look right, too much red etc. (-----> i !!!  am sure -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  a mistake somewhere but perhaps leica could do this right for us, properly, just like phase one do in their \"cultural heritage\" package, where every back comes with a super-precise set of colour profiles). it is not strictly necessary for me, but i would love such an offering from leica. btw, there used to be a specific colour profile for the s2 available for download in the owners' area - why not one (or more) for the s, sl...etc.? if thomas schmidt and his merry band of pirates want to send me a questionnaire, i will be happy to answer it for them. in the meantime, see my suggestions here. edited march 12, 2019 by albireo_double", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30947, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Photon42", "date": "2019-04-03 16:14:00", "content": "5 hours ago, BerkMillers said: Coming from the M system now my new Fuji GFX 50R puts a smile on my face every time i pick it up.

I also would not have sent Malcolm the rusty other (single speed) MOOLY and SCNOO, on the very remote chance they could be resurrected. Malcolm seems to have put a lot of work into the rusty MOOLY and SCNOO, only to come to the conclusion, that as I suspected all along, they are irretrievable. I have now given Malcolm the remains for spare parts.

For those of you know who may not know Ray Allen, he is a recently retired African-American NBA All-Star and world champion Boston Celtics basketball player. While still a rising star in college backbetall, he also played a lead character in one of Spike Lee's movies, \"He Got Game\". (Great movie, by the way). Ray is an impressive man and this article is worthy reading. Rob =========================================================================================================================== Why I Went to Auschwitz Ray Allen NBA AUG 3 2017 There was a small hole in the kitchen floor that led to a secret crawl space. That image is burned into my memory. The space was maybe five feet long by five feet wide. The owner of the house said, \u201cThey used to fit six people inside there. When the Nazis would come.\u201d His name was Tadeusz Skoczylas, and the house we were in had belonged to his family during World War II. It was a small brick house in the town of Ciepiel\u00f3w, Poland. It had a red roof that had seen better days. The front door was just a few steps off the street. In the backyard were a few barns and other small shacks. I had been in Poland for a few days already, and the horror of the history I had experienced was overwhelming. But this was something different. This was so personal. I\u2019m looking at this tiny space. And I\u2019m imagining six people down there, hiding from death. Six real people. Crawling through that little hole right in front of me. Not that long ago. It wasn\u2019t a history book. It wasn\u2019t a museum. It was right there. --img--  Tadeusz explained that one day in 1942, Nazi soldiers visited the house on a tip. Someone in the village had told them that the family had been harboring Jewish people. There were supposed to be 10 Skoczylas living in the house. On this particular day, the youngest boy in the family was not home when the soldiers came by. The Nazis grew suspicious and began tearing the house apart. They found the hole and the crawl space, but the Jewish people the family had been hiding were not there. They had already moved on. Without saying a word, the Nazis went next door to a neighboring family and took their young son. The punishment for hiding Jews was death for the entire family, and they had a quota to fill. The soldiers took all 10 people out back and executed them right in front of those barns and shacks that are still standing there today. When the little Skoczylas boy returned home, he found his entire family dead. That little boy was Tadeusz\u2019s grandfather. The house stayed in the Skoczylas family, and his grandfather lived in it. Now Tadeusz and his mother live in it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. And as I walked through the rest of the house, this feeling sort of took over me. There was all this history right in front of me. And it was real. I could reach out and touch it. I could feel it between my fingers and smell it in the air. It was a tangible thing. I took that trip just a few months ago. It was my first time in Poland. I went there to learn more about something that had fascinated me since I was a teenager: the Holocaust. I\u2019d read so many books and articles about it, but reading words on a page is not the same thing as seeing things up close. Advertisement Then I visited the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., for the first time. It was 1998, and I was playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. I was in D.C. meeting our owner, Herb Kohl, over the summer. We had some time free time on my last day in the city, and Mr. Kohl suggested we go to the Holocaust Museum on the National Mall. I\u2019ll never forget how I felt after those two hours in there \u2014 I could have spent two days. My immediate feeling was that everyone needs to go there. There was one room in particular, though, that I think about often. It\u2019s filled with photos of Jews from a town in Poland. The pictures line the walls and extend up toward the sky, where light floods in from a window. Almost 90% of the people in the images were sent to their death. Before they were taken to concentration camps or executed, they would leave their prized possessions behind with friends or family. The people of these Jewish communities were pushed to the absolute limit of their human instincts. They just wanted to survive. And from that, the tales of brotherhood and camaraderie are so awe-inspiring. It was a reminder of what the human spirit is capable of \u2014 both for good and evil. --img--  Honestly \u2026 it made me feel sort of irrelevant. Which was a strange thought to have as a young NBA player who was supposed to be on top of the world. I was realizing that there were things outside of my bubble that mattered so much more. I wanted my teammates to feel that as well. So every team I played on after that, whenever we were in D.C. playing the Wizards, I would ask our coach if we had time to go through the museum. Every visit was different, but each guy came out thanking me for taking us there. I could see in their eyes that they had a different perspective on life after that experience. I thought I knew what the Holocaust was, and what it meant. I went to Poland with a few close friends to learn more. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for how deeply the visit would affect me. I had seen so many documentaries and films on Auschwitz, but nothing really prepares you for being there. The first thing I felt when I walked through those iron gates was \u2026 heavy. The air around me felt heavy. I stood on the train tracks where the prisoners of the camp would arrive, and I felt like I could hear the trains coming to a halt. I had to take a breath to center myself. It was so immediate. So overwhelming. We walked through the barracks and gas chambers and what I remember most is what I heard: nothing. I\u2019ve never experienced silence like that. Apart from footsteps, the complete lack of sound was almost jarring. It\u2019s eerie and sobering. You\u2019re standing in these rooms where so much death has taken place and your mind is trying to come to terms with all that\u2019s happened in this space. One question keeps repeating over and over and over in your mind: How can human beings do this to one another? How does somebody process that? You can\u2019t. This is not history. This is humanity. This is now. This is a living lesson for us as a people. After Tadeusz Skoczylas took us through his family\u2019s home, I stood outside for a while by myself, thinking about everything I had experienced. Why do we learn about the Holocaust? Is it just so we can make sure nothing like this ever happens again? Is it because six million people died? Yes, but there\u2019s a bigger reason, I think. Advertisement The Holocaust was about how human beings \u2014 real, normal people like you and me \u2014 treat each other. --img--  When the Skoczylas family was risking their own lives to hide people they barely knew, they weren\u2019t doing it because they practiced the same religion or were the same race. They did it because they were decent, courageous human beings. They were the same as those people crouched in a hole. And they knew that those people didn\u2019t deserve what was being done to them. I asked myself a really tough question: Would I have done the same? Really, would I have done the same? When I returned home to America, I got some very disheartening messages directed toward me on social media regarding my trip. Some people didn\u2019t like the fact that I was going to Poland to raise awareness for the issues that happened there and not using that time or energy to support people in the black community. I was told my ancestors would be ashamed of me. I know there are trolls online and I shouldn\u2019t even pay attention, but that one sort of got to me.

Whatever us even means. I think about the Tadeusz family. Who did they define as us? They saw us as every human being, regardless of what they looked like, or what they believed. They thought everyone was worth protecting. And they were willing to die for it.

(great movie, by the way). ray is an impressive man and this article is worthy reading. rob =========================================================================================================================== why i went to auschwitz ray allen nba aug 3 2017 there was a small hole in the kitchen floor that led to a secret crawl space. that image is burned into my memory. the space was maybe five feet long by five feet wide. the owner of the house said, \u201cthey used to fit six people inside there. when the nazis would come.\u201d his name was tadeusz skoczylas, and the house we were in had belonged to his family during world war ii. it was a small brick house in the town of ciepiel\u00f3w, poland. it had a red roof that had seen better days. the front door was just a few steps off the street. in the backyard were a few barns and other small shacks. i had been in poland for a few days already, and the horror of the history i had experienced was overwhelming. but this was something different. this was so personal. i\u2019m looking at this tiny space. and i\u2019m imagining six people down there, hiding from death. six real people. crawling through that little hole right in front of me. not that long ago. it wasn\u2019t a history book. it wasn\u2019t a museum. it was right there. --img--  tadeusz explained that one day in 1942, nazi soldiers visited the house on a tip. someone in the village had told them that the family had been harboring jewish people. there were supposed to be 10 skoczylas living in the house. on this particular day, the youngest boy in the family was not home when the soldiers came by. the nazis grew suspicious and began tearing the house apart. they found the hole and the crawl space, but the jewish people the family had been hiding were not there. they had already moved on. without saying a word, the nazis went next door to a neighboring family and took their young son. the punishment for hiding jews was death for the entire family, and they had a quota to fill. the soldiers took all 10 people out back and executed them right in front of those barns and shacks that are still standing there today. when the little skoczylas boy returned home, he found his entire family dead. that little boy was tadeusz\u2019s grandfather. the house stayed in the skoczylas family, and his grandfather lived in it. now tadeusz and his mother live in it. i couldn\u2019t believe it. and as i walked through the rest of the house, this feeling sort of took over me. there was all this history right in front of me. and it was real. i could reach out and touch it. i could feel it between my fingers and smell it in the air. it was a tangible thing. i took that trip just a few months ago. it was my first time in poland. i went there to learn more about something that had fascinated me since i was a teenager: the holocaust. i\u2019d read so many books and articles about it, but reading words on a page is not the same thing as seeing things up close. advertisement then i visited the holocaust museum in washington, d.c., for the first time. it was 1998, and i was playing for the milwaukee bucks. i was in d.c. meeting our owner, herb kohl, over the summer. we had some time free time on my last day in the city, and mr. kohl suggested we go to the holocaust museum on the national mall. i\u2019ll never forget how i felt after those two hours in there \u2014 i could have spent two days. my immediate feeling was that everyone needs to go there. there was one room in particular, though, that i think about often. it\u2019s filled with photos of jews from a town in poland. the pictures line the walls and extend up toward the sky, where light floods in from a window. almost 90% of the people in the images were sent to their death. before they were taken to concentration camps or executed, they would leave their prized possessions behind with friends or family. the people of these jewish communities were pushed to the absolute limit of their human instincts. they just wanted to survive. and from that, the tales of brotherhood and camaraderie are so awe-inspiring. it was a reminder of what the human spirit is capable of \u2014 both for good and evil. --img--  honestly \u2026 it made me feel sort of irrelevant. which was a strange thought to have as a young nba player who was supposed to be on top of the world. i was realizing that there were things outside of my bubble that mattered so much more. i wanted my teammates to feel that as well. so every team i played on after that, whenever we were in d.c. playing the wizards, i would ask our coach if we had time to go through the museum. every visit was different, but each guy came out thanking me for taking us there. i could see in their eyes that they had a different perspective on life after that experience. i thought i knew what the holocaust was, and what it meant. i went to poland with a few close friends to learn more. but i wasn\u2019t prepared for how deeply the visit would affect me. i had seen so many documentaries and films on auschwitz, but nothing really prepares you for being there. the first thing i felt when i walked through those iron gates was \u2026 heavy. the air around me felt heavy. i stood on the train tracks where the prisoners of the camp would arrive, and i felt like i could hear the trains coming to a halt. i had to take a breath to center myself. it was so immediate. so overwhelming. we walked through the barracks and gas chambers and what i remember most is what i heard: nothing. i\u2019ve never experienced silence like that. apart from footsteps, the complete lack of sound was almost jarring. it\u2019s eerie and sobering. you\u2019re standing in these rooms where so much death has taken place and your mind is trying to come to terms with all that\u2019s happened in this space. one question keeps repeating over and over and over in your mind: how can human beings do this to one another? how does somebody process that? you can\u2019t. this is not history. this is humanity. this is now. this is a living lesson for us as a people. after tadeusz skoczylas took us through his family\u2019s home, i stood outside for a while by myself, thinking about everything i had experienced. why do we learn about the holocaust? is it just so -----> we !!!  -----> can !!!  -----> make !!!  sure nothing like this ever happens again? is it because six million people died? yes, but there\u2019s a bigger reason, i think. advertisement the holocaust was about how human beings \u2014 real, normal people like you and me \u2014 treat each other. --img--  when the skoczylas family was risking their own lives to hide people they barely knew, they weren\u2019t doing it because they practiced the same religion or were the same race. they did it because they were decent, courageous human beings. they were the same as those people crouched in a hole. and they knew that those people didn\u2019t deserve what was being done to them. i asked myself a really tough question: would i have done the same? really, would i have done the same? when i returned home to america, i got some very disheartening messages directed toward me on social media regarding my trip. some people didn\u2019t like the fact that i was going to poland to raise awareness for the issues that happened there and not using that time or energy to support people in the black community. i was told my ancestors would be ashamed of me. i know there are trolls online and i shouldn\u2019t even pay attention, but that one sort of got to me. because i understood where they were coming from. i understand that there are plenty of issues in our own country right now, but they were looking at my trip the wrong way. i didn\u2019t go to poland as a black person, a white person, a christian person or a jewish person \u2014 i went as a human being. --img--  it\u2019s easy to say \u201ci went to make sure these things don\u2019t happen again.\u201d but i went to learn about the true reality of what happened during the holocaust, and what we can take from that. the people who believe that i am not spending my time the way the right way \u2026 well, they\u2019re

Two hours of knowledge and messages. A very personal report. I noticed the event with Peter Karbe too late. It was fully booked, and only thanks to the wonderful Bodo Philipp of Leica Store Berlin and his friendly colleague Benedikt Hartmann of Store Wetzlar, I have slipped in. He was also the one who sent my summary questions from the forum to Peter Karbe and even introduced me to him in the store. He, in turn, had read everything and immediately clarified that he would refuse any answer to future planning. It became not that bad in the end. Karbe is an incredibly nice person. One who lives his work in harmony with his own thinking. He doesn't need a sales approach. Even when he says, \"You've never gotten as much value as with these new lenses.\" It comes as a sober statement. And when he explains that when polishing aspheric lenses, the human skills factor is crucial, because unclean polishing produces onion rings and the whole thing is a quality but also price driver, then we stop whispering. So I try to write down everything I can catch and that I think is interesting in order to be able to reproduce it as close as possible to the spoken word later on, or at least as a sense. He announces hard boring stuff. Expectation management. The digital evolutionary In the first few minutes, he clears up a clich\u00e9 known to Leica enthusiasts (like me): \"We never slept through the digital revolution, but our priority was the Leica M. We adapted the digital technology (above all sensors) to the M and not the other way around. It just took time.\" It is apparently more the electronics than the optics that are the technology drivers of the current progress. And he constantly \u201eevolutionese\u201c them. In other words, we could forget the finest optics that we now get for the SL without mastering all the associated technologies: \"The complexity of the entire process chain was like driving backwards with a number of trailers. To do this, we had to lay new rails. That's why it took so long.\" Something astonishing to our ears when he says that the lenses should have become less sensitive to a higher offset of the individual lenses due to AF. Centering, closing, controlling, reopening, correcting \u2013 for example, the process with M-lenses, that would no longer be possible if everything is adjusted and glued. When asked by the audience about the quality of service with so much complexity: \"Don't worry about that.\" You don't do it if you listen to him. The Optics Challenger Most Leica photographers know his statement that the new generation of lenses can easily manage 100 million pixels. Few people know the derivation except for some of the connoisseurs gathered here. I finally understood it as plausible, though not so deeply that I could explain it in detail. So for all those who, like me, feel good with just some more plausibility: \"With the SL summicrons (also the Summilux SL 50 and also other lenses like the Q lens) we have increased our target by 50%(!) up to 60 lp per mm at 50% contrast. Because it used to be 40 lp before.\" Some manufacturers still work with 30 lp and one (no, I do not name it here) internally with 50. He casually notes that it was the work on the APSC sensor which has already begun to raise the benchmark. When this was finally successful, it was clear that there must be more for the SL system. So that's how it was. Then the explanation for the 100 million pixel statement comes up, the Nyquist frequency for the various pixel values that are now possible. It is 172 lp per mm for 100 MP sensor at 100% contrast. Thus 50% contrast (1/ 2 Nyquist) would be 86 lp. Karbe: \u201cThis is not any problem to our lenses, even in the corners.\u201d And then the superlative: \u201eOur Summicron SL 35 is also our best lens because we had a lot room for 35 mm in that tube.\u201d It handles 204 lp / mm at 50% contrast. Silence in the room. For some people, maybe not so new all this. To me it was quite new \u2013 hard but not boring at all. There are some comments on color defects, CA etc. The lenses are corrected so that the color failure to be corrected on the computer is practical 0. Even I can see that. Finally (thanks from me as an unfortunate S-user to the questioner), the question of S-lenses remains not unanswered. Indeed, they were expected to be 50% for 40 Lp, but: \u201cThere you have less additional magnification. The final picture result is much better at the S.\u201c Thank God. By the way he says, they do only as much as really need to make software corrections of the lenses. As the Leica-JPEG's contrast are not so much too high exaggerated, some tests in magazines are dropping them. I don't care. The sharpness-blur juggler. He also wanted to clarify his view on the sharpness / blur reaction of these SL Crons. The sharp loss of the new SL summicron is about the optical impression of the difference of sharpness and blur. But if you look at how thick the spots are in the background shooting wide open, then a Summilux is still a difference. After so many comparisons here and elsewhere, it's good to have heard it out of his mouth. And I continue to use my M-Summilux lenses. It\u2019s the hour of the wide open shooter: Peter Karbe wants a monitor that shows a message when stopping down: \u201cAre you really sure?\u201d All lens performance ambitions are wide open. \"Whoever photographs with 8 should take a smaller sensor. APSC is also the better sensor if you need DOF images. And more: \u201cInstead of stopping down, a ND filter can do in full format\u201d. Laughter. Alan Greenspan of optics. Finally, the Q&A time. And it's a pleasure to see how smart the audience is asking. Nobody asks directly for future plans. And so the event becomes valuable, even if the answers are like the ones that once Alan Greenspan gave as market outlook. The question of general product strategy and whether Leica leaves the very fast lenses to other manufacturers like the one with the \u201eS\u201c: \u201cWhen we make some faster lenses I cannot say. Now we have this project.\u201d To ask if that would mean that they finally would come once - no answer. The question of cooperation with the L-mount \u2013 he makes clear that this is not cooperation, but the opening up of Leica\u2019s own mount and thus opening the market, in order to enable other good companies making good L-lenses. No question of whether extenders come of course \u2013 but whether they are technically feasible at this high level. The answer makes everything clear to me. \u201cWith an extender, CA will also be magnified. An optical extender would be less good than a digital crop today. So, actually, we don't need it anymore.\u201c And: \u201cExtender wouldn't be my ... [Smile and silence] \u2026 but I would never say we never make one.\u201c Understand? The Tilt-Shift question is next: \u201cI may not and cannot answer that.\u201d The number of these lenses by other producers should lead to a realistic view here. A long telephoto lens? Of course he would like to make a long tele, he says, but if at all, and if so, when \u2013 he really doesn't know. Then it comes: \u201cWhy don't you use the 90-280 and crop it?\u201c And Sigma is a good company as well. The question of whether there\u2019s no demand for macro lenses anymore - here he makes a purchase recommendation: \u201cprobably there is further demand. I also recommend the EIpro-lens. Thank you anyway for that point. I'll pass it on.\u201d He's showing his own macro photos. I think he'd enjoy developing a macro. That's all I could get out. This friendly modest anti-guru makes us astonished again: He's just doing JPEG because he's too lazy to work on LR he says. Culture clash for a notorious DNG nerd like me. And besides, he's still using an M8. Among others I guess. That\u2019s what I noted. Unfortunately I\u2019ve got nothing about OIS and IBIS \u2013 sorry for that. Maybe because I\u2019m not that focussed on that topic and other participants remember more about it. Anyway \u2013 listening to Peter Karbe is informative and enjoyable. Actually, Leica should clone him and thus save a lot of glory marketing expenses.", "link":

messages. a very personal report. i noticed the event with peter karbe too late. it was fully booked, and only thanks to the wonderful bodo philipp of leica store berlin and his friendly colleague benedikt hartmann of store wetzlar, i have slipped in. he was also the one who sent my summary questions from the forum to peter karbe and even introduced me to him in the store. he, in turn, had read everything and immediately clarified that he would refuse any answer to future planning. it became not that bad in the end. karbe is an incredibly nice person. one who lives his work in harmony with his own thinking. he doesn't need a sales approach. even when he says, \"you've never gotten as much value as with these new lenses.\" it comes as a sober statement. and when he explains that when polishing aspheric lenses, the human skills factor is crucial, because unclean polishing produces onion rings and the whole thing is a quality but also price driver, then we stop whispering. so i try to write down everything i can catch and that i think is interesting in order to be able to reproduce it as close as possible to the spoken word later on, or at least as a sense. he announces hard boring stuff. expectation management. the digital evolutionary in the first few minutes, he clears up a clich\u00e9 known to leica enthusiasts (like me): \"we never slept through the digital revolution, but our priority was the leica m. we adapted the digital technology (above all sensors) to the m and not the other way around. it just took time.\" it is apparently more the electronics than the optics that are the technology drivers of the current progress. and he constantly \u201eevolutionese\u201c them. in other words, we could forget the finest optics that we now get for the sl without mastering all the associated technologies: \"the complexity of the entire process chain was like driving backwards with a number of trailers. to do this, we had to lay new rails. that's why it took so long.\" something astonishing to our ears when he says that the lenses should have become less sensitive to a higher offset of the individual lenses due to af. centering, closing, controlling, reopening, correcting \u2013 for example, the process with m-lenses, that would no longer be possible if everything is adjusted and glued. when asked by the audience about the quality of service with so much complexity: \"don't worry about that.\" you don't do it if you listen to him. the optics challenger most leica photographers know his statement that the new generation of lenses can easily manage 100 million pixels. few people know the derivation except for some of the connoisseurs gathered here. i finally understood it as plausible, though not so deeply that i could explain it in detail. so for all those who, like me, feel good with just some more plausibility: \"with the sl summicrons (also the summilux sl 50 and also other lenses like the q lens) we have increased our target by 50%(!) up to 60 lp per mm at 50% contrast. because it used to be 40 lp before.\" some manufacturers still work with 30 lp and one (no, i do not name it here) internally with 50. he casually notes that it was the work on the apsc sensor which has already begun to raise the benchmark. when this was finally successful, it was clear that there must be more for the sl system. so that's how it was. then the explanation for the 100 million pixel statement comes up, the nyquist frequency for the various pixel values that are now possible. it is 172 lp per mm for 100 mp sensor at 100% contrast. thus 50% contrast (1/ 2 nyquist) would be 86 lp. karbe: \u201cthis is not any problem to our lenses, even in the corners.\u201d and then the superlative: \u201eour summicron sl 35 is also our best

My name is Ka\u00efs, french photographer based in Paris, France. I started my Leica journey with a M9, ten years ago, sold and upgraded with a M9-P A Monochrom (version 1) quickly followed him all of them bought brand new. Wanting to get my hands on a \"real Leica\", I bought a M6 Titanium set with its Summicron 35/1.4. The medium lust was too hard to resist: a S2 with a Summarit 70 joined my stable. Let's add a wide angle to my S system: a brand new Summarit 35. Time has past, I added a M7 (0.58 finder), a Q Titanium, a Monochrom version 2, a M5, an Elmarit 90/2.0, a Summicron 50, a Summarit 35/2.4... We are talking about minimum 44 500\u20ac (including the S007)!!!!! Then, the problems begun: both my M9-P and Monochrom I had a sensor failure (cracked sensor). How come a \"pro\" camera could have a sensor cracked? During my carreer, I owned a 5DmkII, a D3x, a Df, a 5DmkIV (I'm still using today) that NEVER failed me, NEVER. Anyways, Leica has been kind enough to replace both sensors for free. When the S007 came out, I was tempted to upgrade my aging S2. At my usual Leica dealer, they kindly checked my S2 before it goes on sale and discovered a corroded sensor! Come on! A third failure from a so serious comapany? I must be the unluckiest photographer on earth then. Still, I upgraded to a reconditioned mint grade SOO7, checked by Leica with a one year guarantee. During my second shooting, the 70 started to rattle from time to time, missing focus lock. Of course, my poker face never let any worries showed to my clients. Back home, I uploaded the photos into Capture One and got struck by what I have discovered (picture attached). I thought my memory card failed (I exclusively use hi-speed Sandisk Extreme and Extreme Pro SD). I tried with different cards, same problem. The DNGs are available if requested. I met the people of Leica at Paris Salon de la photo (photoshow) and, after hours of friendly chat, they acknowledged that there was a video card failure. Wait a second. Are we talking about Leica's flagship camera here? The one that is supposed to compete with a Hasselblad HD6-50 or a PhaseOne XF??? A failure after less than 2000 photos taken? Is this german so-called excellence? Since November 8th, 2018 my SOO7 is at the customer service (I hope) and I have NO NEWS from them!!! How come a pro photographer can trust such miserable products????? How come my 2400\u20ac 5DmkIV works like a charm after litteraly thousands and thousands of photos??? How come it takes 10 days max to Canon to fix and upgrade the firmware of their pro camera when I have been waiting 6+ months to get any information from Wetzlar??? I'm over with this overrated brand. Keep on releasing limited edition for rich Qataris and Russians and let the pros (Canon, Nikon, Hasselblad, Fuji, to name a few) run the photography business.

I would not use Leicas if I needed to make a living from photography. The S and the SL were aimed at professional photographers and neither has succeeded in making serious inroads into the professional market. The S has been plagued by a litany of technical problems and the SL does not have the lens range or system accessories that the major professional brands can supply. That just leaves the Ms, which can, perhaps, provide usable tools to professionals doing non mainstream work, but the cameras are just too quirky and delicate for a lot of professional work. Then there is the whole issue about providing a level of service and repair functionality commensurate with the price paid for Leica products. I could go on, but if I were the OP and needed to make a living from my cameras, I would have ceased to use the brand a lot more quickly than he has.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. I have been doing for last year and half for BW. I use single load Paterson tank with plastic reel. DD-X (1+4), Ilfostop, ilford fixer and settled on Kodak films. Scan using Plustek. Use of changing bag requires some practice. Out of 30+ rolls, I have messed up only two rolls. They got stuck in the reel and I had to unload it back into the cartridge to start all over again (didn't lose any pictures). Just sacrifice one roll and keep it for practice. As for water temp, keeping 20c in summer is not a problem (I am in San Francisco area). In winter I have to mix tap hot water to bring it to 20c. I also use it to create a bath in a large deep tray to bring other chemicals to same temperature. One large jug, one gallon water jug for extra water, two glass 500cc mug for mixing developer and stopper and one 1 liter dark chemical bottle for fixer (since it gets reused). And yes, one good glass thermometer. Tap water is good and for final wash I keep a gallon of distilled water bottle that lasts for many rolls. Add few drops of photoflow in last wash.

I use / do the following... Loading Tools: 1) Large dark bag (I also use this when traveling to load LF film). 2) Paterson tank/s (Universal takes 2x 135 or 1x 120 film/s) [I have several, including 1 small one for processing 1x 135 film]. 3) Bottle opener / cassette opener [when using my EOS, I don\u2019t bother opening th cassette, as I can set it to leave a leader when rewinding]. 4) Small pair of scissors to trim the end of the film square to feed into the reel. Loading: 1) Lay the bag out on a flattish area [I do mine on the sofa]. 2) Place the components in the bag in an order / area where you know where to find them. Note that (at least with the Paterson set) the reel/s must be totally dry, or you may have problems feeding the film/s. Also check that the pawl ball bearing are moving freely. [for me the layout is tank / tank-funnel / cap down the left side; reel/s with axle tube next to tank; film/s in middle; scissors / opener on right side - you can practice feeling your way around these items without loading a film. It becomes very easy very quickly]. 3) Close and seal the bag zip. 4) Position yourself comfortably, having removed watch etc [Gary is correct about the phone - It\u2019s happened so often to me that I wonder if there\u2019s a CCTV that I\u2019m not aware of. I\u2019ve also had a fly with a sense of humour land on my nose, which produces a head dance that must look good on the CCTV]. 5) Open the first film, placing the opener back to the right side of the bag. 6) Find the end of the film, and use the scissors to trim square-ish. I use my fingers as a guide - No need to be accurate - and I also chamfer the corners to make it easier to feed. 7) Feel for the 2 raised lead-in pieces on the 1st reel, line them up, and feed the film in enough to pass the pawl ball bearings. Start ratcheting the 2 sides of the reel, with thumbs on top of the 2 raised lead-in pieces to ensure the film doesn\u2019t jump out. 8 ) Continue feeding until you get to the end (cassette comes up to the reel, and resists pulling back). Tear the cassette off (unless you are using Rollei infrared, where you may have to cut the end of the film). Rathchet the remaining film into the reel. 9) Repeat for the 2nd film, if there is one. 10) Feed the reels onto the axle tube, and load the reels into the tank (flanged end of the axle tube to bottom of the tank. 11) Fit the sealing tank funnel into the tank, twisting it to lock in place. Try to gently reverse it to check that it is locked. The tank is now light-safe. 12) Fit the cap on the tank, and then you can remove your hands and open the bag. This all sounds much harder than it is. With dry reels, 2 films can be loaded in a few minutes, and it is very easy to do (unless you own a fly with a sense of humour). Developing Tools and Consumables: I do my developing at a small sink in a small shower room. I use: 100ml graduates 600ml graduates 1000ml graduates 1000-1200ml plastic Tupperware-ish jugs with sealing lids to store working solutions 3000ml plastic jugs for when I plan on doing a lot of developing Small funnels 100-200ml measuring cups 1000-1200ml plastic jugs Paper coffee filters for when my source chemicals are getting a bit lumpy (chemistry term) Developer [I usually use R09 (Rodinal) @ 1:50 one-shot, or Ilford DDX @ 1:4 or 1:9] - Mix enough to at least get through the session. Stop [I use Ilfostop and mix 1000ml @ 1:19, so that I can rotate the 600ml tank requirement over time - If left for a long time, Stop will get mould on top]. Fixer [I use Ilford @ 1:4 and mix 1000-1200ml, so that I can rotate the 600ml tank requirement over time. You can check solution strength and how long to fix for by testing in daylight - drop one of the end clippings of film into the fixer solution and see how long it takes to turn clear, with a bit of agitation every 30sec. Multiply that time by 2.5 - 3.0 to get how long to fix for]. Photoflo [I use Ilfodol @ 1:200 (5ml teaspoon in 1000ml) - Keep an eye on this solution as, over time it will start to gather \u2018floaties\u2019, which you don\u2019t want to settle on your films. Throw away once you see this happening]. Developing: It takes me 20-30 minutes to develop a film run, start to hanging up to dry. Variation is partly on film being used and what I\u2019m trying to achieve, and partly on how distracted I get during the process. The key (despite the distractions) is consistency. As mentioned, Massive Dev Chart website is a very good starting point. Use it, see how the results turn out, then adjust to suit what works for you. I use tap water, and don\u2019t worry about the temperatures. I\u2019m in Malaysia, but my developing is inside an apartment, so probably around 24 C. Prepare what you need before you start. I have the Developer, Stop, Fixer, and 3x 600ml bottles of water (for the rinse) ready at the sink, and the Ilfodol solution sitting behind me (it\u2019s not time-critical). My agitation process is slow hand-to-hand rotations of the tank (like horizontally undoing a large threaded jar), whilst gently tipping end-to end about 30 deg each way. My Paterson Universal 2-film tank process is: 1) 600ml of water into tank and continuous agitation for 1 min. Tip out water (may have dye, depending upon film emulsion). 2) 600ml of working Developer solution into tank. Agitate for 30 sec continuous, then 5 sec (3 rocking sequences) every 1 min for the required total developing time. Tip out (reuse or dispose, depending upon whether one-shot or not). 3) 600ml of working Stop solution into tank. Agitate for 1 min continuous. Tip back into jug for re-use. 4) 600ml of workin Fixer solution into tank. Agitate for 1 min continuous, then 5 sec (3 rocking sequences) every 30 sec for the required total fixing time. Tip back into jug for re-use. Note some films, particularly if under-exposed, will colour the Fixer pink / crimson. 5) 600ml of water into tank and agitate 7x (Ilford say 5x). Tip out. 6) 600ml of water into tank and agitate 14x (Ilford say 10x). Tip out. 7) 600ml of water into tank and agitate 28x [I like numbers] (Ilford say 20x). Tip out. 8 ) Remove cap, sealing funnel, and reels. Films probably look dark on the reels, as you can\u2019t see through the multiple layers. 9) Set up a jug or container with the Ilfodol solution at a height where you are able to roll the film back and forth, hand to hand in a \u2018U\u2019 shape, dipped in the solution. 10) Break open the first reel and do the slow hand-to-hand semaphore dance for 2 min. This ensures the film is well-coated in the photoflo. At the end of the time, stretch your arms out wide and drain the Ilfodol off the film back into the container. 11) Hang the film up to dry. I use pegs or clips at the top, hanging off a cotton thread in the shower, and attach a small weight to the bottom (paper clips) to keep them straight-ish. 12) Repeat 10 & 11 for the 2nd film. Notes: The first time you do this, you\u2019ll realise how much easier it is than it sounds - It\u2019s just very wordy to describe. I give the tank a couple of bangs on a hard surface after each agitation sequence, to \u2018ensure\u2019 no bubbles are left on the films. The agitations witty the Developer are gentle and slow. With the Stop, Fixer, and water, it doesn\u2019t matter so much. Don\u2019t worry about seconds, and how long it takes to go between stages. This is a very \u2018organic\u2019 and forgiving process. I have even had a film that I\u2019d exposed 25 years ago and forgotten about (and didn\u2019t know what the emulsion was) produce usable results from stand developing. You don\u2019t need to get every last drop out as you move between sequences. There will be a little dilution through cross transfer, but it is negligible. Consistency is the key. Get consistent, then get creative. Jump in. The basic set-up is very low-cost and simple. Kitchen measuring cups and jugs are just as effective as graduates etc, so there is very little capital outlay. A change bag works well for me - As noted by others, I\u2019d advise getting a large one, giving more room to play. Trust me (if you can) - You\u2019re going to enjoy this. The first successful film you develop will bring back that same buzz you had years ago, and will have you wanting to go out and shoot more. Returning to film was the best photographic move I\u2019ve done in the last 30 years, and developing at home has been a key enabler / enthusiasm-builder. As Gary suggested, jump into the \u2018I like film...\u2019 thread to see great photo\u2019s, great banter, and a collection of very supportive people who will positively help you with any questions you have. I also develop C41, but the process is, to me, less enthralling - more routine. B&W is the biz!

The software team has confirmed that for the time being, we will not be adding support via VueScan or any other third party application. Someone else has asked about making FlexColor open source so that end users can maintain and update it. But our team has confirmed that this isn't possible due to restrictions on some of the source code and the restructuring required. In addition to that, the source code is not useful for a 64 bit system because as you know, all the UI code is strongly tied to a 32 bit only framework. If anything changes with this, I will let you know. To which I replied: Quote Thanks for getting back to me. I can't imagine why the software team would say that. Essentially they are say the scanner is doomed and we won't let anyone rescue it. I wonder if they are familiar with the fable of \u00c6sop about the dog in the manger? Frankly it seems there is something rotten about this whole business. I have seen two monthly Hasselblad newsletters come out that still say nothing about the discontinuation of the Flextight line. It looks like a company trying to sell off remaining stock to unsuspecting customers, who will buy an expensive item with no idea it has been orphaned. It stinks. I suspect Victor Hasselblad would be disgusted. There is NO reason to prevent someone else making these scanners useable in the future. It won't cost Hasselblad a penny. Selling brand new scanners to customers who have not been told they are discontinued and the software is about to become useless will expose the company to lawsuits, and rightly so. This reeks of short-term bean-counters making decisions that may maximise profit for a quarter or two, but cause a huge loss of respect for the brand shortly after that. It makes me want to pick them up and shake them! I'm sorry you have to work for such idiots. By all means pass this e-mail on to everyone in the company so they may know how angry I am with them. At this point I may as well sell my X1 and manage as best I can with an old Nikon 9000 (also discontinued but still supported by VueScan and by Silverfast). It's a disgrace. Now let me add that I am in no way cross with you personally. You have been a great help to me and you deserve to work for a more honest company than Hasselbald seems to be at present. My leukemia is sliding into relapse and there will be some more chemo shortly. Currently laid up with shingles in the worst part of the body imaginable. I can stand up to take some photos, and even to develop the film, but I can't sit down at the scanner to digitise them! If I could, I'd throw the bloody scanner at the software team, and I wish you'd tell them so! I don't know if we'll have occasion to talk again, but if not I wish you all the best for the future. If they change their mind please tell me about it. I've gone out on a limb promising the author of VueScan all sorts of support from users if he gets the necessary engineering details and comes up with working software. It's not just current owners being let down, but all those buying new scanners with no idea that they are buying a discontinued product, and then again, anyone who might develop software to keep them functional. Pretty hard to defend against a lawsuit where the plaintiff's case is that \"You sold me a $25,000 scanner without telling me it was about to become useless.\" Maybe Hasselblad have no lawyers on staff. Oh, well, I hope it works out for those to whom it will matter in the longer term. I shan't have to worry about that - I have bought up five old Macintoshes to keep the scanner going. I daresay I won't outlive the first of them. Not my problem after that! And the reply: Quote I'm sorry that it's taken me a while to reply. I sent your email to my direct manager and few other managers. I have hope that they will pass it on to the decision makers of the company, but I'm sure you already know not to expect any changes on this subject. I want to let you know that I appreciate your response and thoughtfulness. I have been given a few reasons for the inability to move forward with FlexColor and with a third party, some of which I have shared with you. They are logical reasons, but I still think that we should still try. Even though the current 10.14 OS can be used, and an older computer can be dedicated to scanning, I think we should put forth more effort with this. So it looks like Hasselblad has dumped us. No support from them, and no possibility of letting anyone else support the scanners.

In this old post is the test I made using my Coolscan V ED and my Canon 5D2 with the 100L macro. In this test the camera pulled more from the negative than the scanner. That can be a good or a bad thing. Typically for my workflow I aim to get as lifeless, flat and boring a scan as I am able to in order to preserve flexibility for the post-processing (this is why I wrote somewhat sloppily below that the camera was 'close' to the V ED). In my experience a sharper file may not withstand post-processing so well as I prefer to sharpen in at least two later stages, sharpening before finalising an image for computer/internet viewing and final sharpening before printing. But for a straight out of the camera file the digitized result was, I think, very good. There is a great convenience in having digital ICE even though it does soften images a bit. I am no longer using the V ED or my Coolscan 9000 but that function saved me lots of time. Since a while back I have switched to a Flextight X1, which doesn't have digital ICE. Flexcolor's Flextouch function doesn't work well enough for me but with proper cleaning of negs (Ilford's Antistaticum is a must) dust-spotting is usually not very time-consuming for a 2000-3000 dpi file. An X1 scan at full resolution will however reveal literally every bloody little thing on the neg which is in equal measure extremely impressive and extremely frustrating so I only scan at full resolution when absolutely necessary. I'm sure that in the future I will switch to digitising using a suitable camera rig. My main concern at present is that it would require stitching anything larger than 35mm film and I am not very keen on that. So for now I stick with my scanners even though I have the 5D2 and the macro lens. I think it is a very positive sign that just in the last year or two the number of sites and forum threads for instance here and at RFF showing various ways to digitize has increased very much. So there are a lot of people out there who try this out and come up with very creative solutions, both in terms of equipment, rigs and ways to post-process (including \"getting rid\" of the orange mask on C41). On this note just a friendly piece of advice to the OP.

I also did indoor sports with 2475 recording film. Yet I never liked heavy grain - so when possible I used Panatomic-X (ASA 64). In the 10 years since retiring and shooting film again, I've found I prefer the Ilford films, using PanF+ the most. I've had good tonality results with HP5+, but again prefer finer grain. Having tried TMax and Ilford Delta films, I prefer Delta, particularly for the handling when processing and drying. So I've ditched my remaining bulk of Tri-X and started loading Delta. On the other hand, I do like the results of HP5+ in 120 size, where the grain isn't an issue. I guess I should 120 Tri-X again. Still have a soft spot for Kodak, and will be doing more Ektachrome for color. Looking forward to 120 size in that also. Panatomic-X was also a favourite of mine (although I recollect it as being ASA 32), along with Techpan, and Tri-X. These days, in 135, my preference is for Delta 100, with Tri-X for anything requiring a bit more latitude. I like, but don\u2019t love, the TMax films. For slower stuff, I really like the Adox CMS 20 (reminds me of Techpan), and also sometimes use Rollei RPX 25 and Ilford PanF+. For 120, Delta 100 and Tri-X are both crackingly good. For LF, Delta 100 and Tri-X 320 are beltingly crackingly good. I\u2019m generally developing in R09 (Rodinal), or DDX.

Most certainly my all-thumbs approach. In the calibration instructions near the end, there are instructions as to how make adjustments based on sensitivity/contrast information provided by the paper manufacturer. This information is available in the data sheet that comes with the Ilford Classic FB paper. If you do the simple calculations, the adjustments for grades oo to 3 are all -2 and for grades 4 and 5 the adjustment is -1. The contrast offsets are 170, 140, 110, 95, 80, 60 and 50. These settings work quite well, and can be slightly adjusted if necessary. They also make sense. What a terrific unit. Hi Michael, Thanks for your post. I decided to make a print using the offset values that I arrived at during calibration and, not surprisingly, the print was very overexposed. I'm not sure where I went wrong during the calibration procedure, but the offsets I came up with appear to be very wrong. Funny you should mention the data sheets, because earlier today I decided to do exactly as you described and came up with offsets from the data sheets for MG IV RC (the Analyzer's default) and MG Classic FB.

Each blade is stored in a rolled up position around a rod and is controlled by one of four knobs - when you turn the knob one way the blade unfurls, covering part of the 24mm x 36 mm space in the negative carrier. Depending on how the enlarger is stored, serviced and/or used, the blades could eventually become brittle and more susceptible to breaking (see attached image of a broken unfurled blade). This becomes more of an issue with time but is hardly ever raised or followed up on because few people use the masking function, instead preferring to crop via easel or paper. I could be wrong, but it sounds to me like one of your blades is broken and is now detached from the rod which the knob controls. Many years ago (sometime last century, actually \ud83d\ude2c), I had the same issue with my trusty V35 and managed to take the masking assembly apart. If I recall correctly, the task wasn't particularly challenging - and I wouldn't say I am particularly DIY-minded. The real problem lay in getting hold of replacement blades. Luckily for me, I had a good relationship with Nobby Clark and Bob Herriott of the Service Department at Leica UK, way back in the good old Milton Keynes days.

Quite frankly, with 3 fully functional blades, you do not really need a fourth.

Get an ANR negative holder; you won't regret it. I made a lens holder by taking a piece of aluminum the same size as my 23CII-XL takes, had a large hole drilled in its center and then drilled three holes in both in a tripod arrangement for three small bolts to adjust the two plates against each other. spacing was maintained with a ring of black foam.

I missed my calling. hth --img--  Sorry if this sounds obvious, but a laser alignment tool will ensure the film, lens-board, and paper planes are parallel - but it won't help film flatness (for which glass is needed). The name for such devices, by the way, is a collimator, and they don't need to be laser-powered. Many years ago I used such an instrument manufactured by Rodenstock to critically align a customer's enlarger - he was using a point source in his condenser head to illuminate the film, a system which shows up the slightest discrepancy.

I\u2019m posting here for feedback, in case anybody of you would like to test the application (with the M9) and show the results and your opinions. I usually shoot film photography but also I like the comfort of digital. The problem is that I\u2019ve never been happy with existing film emulations. Mainly because of that, because they are emulations instead of simulations. METHOD USED For doing so, instead of doing a generic conversion for every camera, I\u2019ve done a specialised conversion for the Leica M9 based on simulating the chemical process and spectrum response, instead of applying curves and other stuff. In the end, I thought, if analog and digital are just two instruments which capture light, I thought, maybe is there any mathematical conversion to make the digital to look like film? I mean, if I take the same photo with analog and digital, under exact same conditions (light / aperture / exposition /\u2026) could I make them look exactly the same? It\u2019s based on chemical simulation and the Leica M9\u2019s response to spectrum. Then LUTs and finally some extra calibration. I think that it could be improved because I\u2019ve used home made or open source tools for calibrating and so on, which are far from perfect. EXAMPLES (Analog vs Converted Digital) Following are some examples of Superia 200 and TriX 400. Click in each photo to see high resolution. DNGs shoots taken with Leica M9 (left), and FILM shoots taken with Minolta CLE (right) at same conditions (aperture / exposition / ISO). All shoots taken with Zeiss Biogon T* ZM 35mm f/2. The examples show several photos, which are the following:+------------------------+------------------------+ | original DNG | | +------------------------+------------------------+ | converted DNG | scanned FILM | +------------------------+------------------------+ | developed DNG | developed FILM | +------------------------+------------------------+ For the generated simulated negative TIFF file and the scanned TIFF file I\u2019ve applied exactly the same develop parameters. TriX 400 - 1 TriX 400 - 2 TriX 400 - 3 Superia 200 - 1 Superia 200 - 2 Superia 200 - 3 Superia 200 - 4 Superia 200 - 5 Superia 200 - 6 CONCLUSIONS Tonal range - Biggest difference between digital and film Dynamic range - Digital is faaar more detailed in the blacks, film never gets burnt, meanwhile digital gets burn quite fast. Film has more microcontrast, it's more sharpen Digital is a little bit more contrast after developing, I imagine it\u2019s because it reach white level faster, then, when doing autolevels with the developing program, as a result, it\u2019s a more contrast image. DOWNLOAD I'm having a console application ready, if interest is shown it will be ready quite soon! CAVEHEATS / LIMITATIONS The program only accept DNG, because I need all the light captured by the camera, instead of a JPG already converted and really dependent on camera self made adjustments. The program only accepts photos taken at the ISO of the certain film that is gonna be used. For example, for TriX400 it will accept only Leica M9 DNGs at 400 ISO. I\u2019ve also done tests with ISO 200 and 800, and the results were quite satisfactory but, for complexity reasons, I prefer to let it be native film ISO for the moment. Highlights are not always correct, and sometimes they look weird, mainly in color film. This is due to bayer sensor pattern and its different intensity response (for Red, Green and Blue channels).

Shutter speeds were set by the camera and formed an expected progression of 1/45, 1/90, 1/180, and 1/360. Shooting at a lower ISO does not seem to hurt anything, although there is less shadow detail (hard to see here). Shooting at a higher ISO definitely compresses the results into a narrower slice, and while a lot of information can be retained there is still a lot of loss here. My takeaway: shooting at the ISO expected by the program is worthwhile. Hi, I like all your testings and your conclusions about the program As said before, all the chemical simulation is done for the native film ISO. So, for TriX 400, ISO 400 should be always used to get the closest thing to the reality. (Since all the simulation calculations done for film behaviour were precalculated using this params). It's true that it's possible to push the image (+/-3 stops in camera) and then, at developing time, push the image the same number of stops. Only note that if using -autodevelop, this won't be optimal. My workflow for TriX400 is the following: 1. Shoot the DNG at ISO 400 pushed +/- 3 stops (or not). 2.

My folder structure on this drive is by year, month, day. 2019 > April > 04-20-2019. Etc I slide my camera card into my Satechi base while lightroom is open. Lightroom automatically moves to import screen. Most times, the last selected folder is still selected (M.2 > 2019 > April) If the files on the card are new, as in there is no \"date\" folder yet, one is created automagically and I can see it on the right column with a check mark in front of it. If files also exist on the card for another date, as in yesterday, then those files will be marked to go into the correct date folder. Once I verify by visually just looking (sometimes lightroom will try to put the files on my computers hard drive, and I have to remind it that this is not what I want by selecting the correct \"month\" folder on my m.2), I simply click import. I have mine setup to also show jpegs aside the DNG files, which are always B&W. I wait. Once done, I eject the card, remove the card, and it goes back into the camera. Next time I turn on the camera, or in the next few days, I reformat the card in camera. Usually while the import is happening, I'm already flagging keepers. Once the import is done, I continue to mark keepers and obvious rejects using the thumbnail strip. If the photo merits a deeper look, as in I can't tell from the thumbnail, it gets flagged white no matter. After this first run, I double check rejects, and delete them also removing from disk. Then in the develop module, I narrow down to only white flags, and arrow key through them seeking photos to take out of the flagged list. similar images, poor framing, over or under exposed, just not strong enough, that sort of stuff. once done, I next go image by image and 5 star my absolute favorites. Also in this step, I make a decision if this photo should be color or B&W. Also in this step, I identify any \"series\" of photos that should be processed similar. I love series of photos, and I want them to look the same as each other. From there, I edit. Once complete, CMD A, export, jpg 75%, long side 2080px, include copyright and they all export to a single folder titled EXPORT. This folder is kept clean and empty. I then open photos, drag the exports into PHOTOS, they import to my iCloud, and I move the exports to a subfolder titled OLD. Once per month I usually empty this OLD folder, I can't tell you why I don't do it right away... Usually once per month, I will export some previous month as it's own catalog, and then back that catalog and photos to a NAS, which in turn automatically backs up to a cloud service. I make a duplicate copy of same on an additional external hard drive. Then I remove those same photos from lightroom and from my M.2 drive, other wise it would be full in a hurry.

There is no real comparison to Lightroom or other software in this respect. I've just spent about a half an hour \u2014 not enough for a real evaluation \u2014 reprocessing with Luminar Flex some M10 DNG files into somewhat high-contrast B&W \u2014 and find it difficult to get to a look I like that I got with Silver Efex. Actually, I used some \"formulas\" in AnalogEfex and ColorEfex (for B&W) that I've developed to get the type of look that I want.

I hasten to say that I start with a mistrust of Luminar because a couple of years ago I tried out some modules of the predecessor MacPhun app: I used the MacPhun Intensification module on some color images in an attempt at selective edits of parts of the images. The problem was that the resulting processed images had applied to a much larger, and even different areas, of the images than I had selected in the MacPhun view. When I wrote to MacPhun they conceded that this was a problem that would be fixed in the next update. But that update still had not fixed the problem.

While my grandma always had a red dot attached, I recently came to my first Leica by coincidence. A couple of months ago, clearly in a state of mental derangement, I bought a Fuji X100F. As I already own an Olympus Pen-F (the digital one) I immediately had a sincere case of buyers remorse as those cameras are pretty redundant. So I returned the Fuji to the shop the next day. They took it back but refused to refund the money and gave credit instead. Damn it, dead money... About two weeks ago, I was pretty frustrated and went back to the shop to cash in my credit for something I could make use of. The dealer suggested a Nikon Z6. I didn't want to buy it right away so I had a good night of sleep and returned the next day to get it. And why not? From what I read and saw it is a damn good camera for almost any application at a ridiculously low price. Clearly a step up from my MicroFourThirds toy. And helping Nikon survive - \"oh, what's that???\" I swear it wasn't there the day before. The most beautiful camera I ever saw: a Leica M6! Well, it says \"Leitz\" on the dot. And it looks like new. My god, I'm in love, its a good price, I need a lens, Leica lenses are kinda expensive, I gotta feed my family, pay the mortgage, pay taxes, ooops, \"Thanks! Always a pleasure making business with you!\" So here I am, with tons of questions about how to shoot wich film and how to focus a 35 Summilux and how to locate the $/&%!

After I picked up the camera once it returned, the touch screen does not work. I contacted to Leica Camera AG again. They have asked me to send it in \"again\" so I packed all the camera in the box included with all accessories and took it to my local Leica store (I live in Thailand) and told them that I am not happy at all and I don't wish to get this camera back. I've asked them to find the best solution for me. If I am not happy, I will sue them. That is the way I solve the problem. (now I am still waiting as of 20190605). Now I haven't used my camera for 5 months already and it's counting. If you want to take your camera to service, it will cost you 4 months at least and not sure that you will get another problem back or not. RIP Leica warranty service for premium goods. Will come back again when I get any updates.

I have put through two test films. The first test film produced negatives that in the most part showed consistent narrow spacings, however, on closer inspection there was still some noticeable spacing difference in part of the negative. This raised my concern, so I put through a second test film which produced negatives with narrow spacing which showed variation in spacings that were not consistent in size. I developed these films with other films taken on my M7 (all incidentally Kodak Tri-X). As expected, the M7 negatives all had wider spacings, but more importantly the spacing were all consistent and of the same width. It would appear that the M-A have smaller frame spacings compared to the M7, which I can live with. The worry again is the inconsistent noticable difference in size of the spacings between the frames of negatives produced on the M-A. Is this inconsistent variation in size between frame spacing the norm with negatives produced with the M-A or do I have another 'defective' new camera. I will put through a another test film tomorrow to see what the results from the negatives when developed. In the meantime, can anyone on the forum who regularly use M-As be willing to provide a digital copy of 'contact prints' showing the spacings between the negatives so I can compare them to my negatives. Would Wattsy be willing to help? Would very much appreciate any assistance.

It looks like the Panasonic S1R is prone to some sort of shutter vibrations when using mechanical shutter. This is not the case with the Sony a9 camera. I have already done quite a bit of testing and found that on the S1R, image sharpness starts to get better above 1/50sec with a 400mm @ f4 on a tripod. The sharpness more or less will peak at 1/100sec and above. Beyond 1/100sec, sharpness is about on par with electronic shutter. This is quite a big difference from the Sony a9 where on the same setup, I can get sharp images even at 1/15sec. I am not sure why the S1R is behaving like this. You can get sharp images on adapted lenses up to about 100mm at very low shutter speeds (1sec) but above that focal length, things become worse off. If the cause is because of shutter vibration, then it should be consistent across all focal lengths. I hope it is not unique to my camera \ud83d\ude04 Anyway, my findings have already been reported to the local Panasonic office and my understanding is that this information will be given to Panasonic Japan for their consideration.

Both OIS and IBIS only really need to activate with a shutter press, so leave it set to 'Half Press'. No idea what the advantage of 'always on' is to be honest. I think the main power hogs are driving the EVF and LCD, so settings that shut these down quickly and put the camera to sleep have more consumption benefits.

The OVF experience will always be reflected light, either directly in a rangefinder, or reflected off a mirror. EVF's will never be able to replicate that perfectly, nor would they ever really aspire to, as they are showing you the output of the sensor, not the image of the actual scene. It can be very effectively argued that seeing the output of the sensor can be more helpful, as you see a closer approximation of the final result, but I would rather work with the scene as it actually appears.

Warning: what follows is all wild speculation on my part \ud83d\ude42 So basically we just need a light-tight box and a mechanism to insert and transport roll film - of which we'd waste quite a lot of real estate - and then we would need a Leica S mount on this light-tight box and we'd be good to go. Of course there would be no way to measure the light, control exposure and composition and check focus, which is why we would need separate light- and distance-meters and luckily we have a distance window on our S lenses. Not extremely accurate, but you know, it\u2019s just low-res film anyway (just kidding) Composition could be checked by something like a Sony RX0 that we could glue on top of the camera. Of course we\u2019d still need some electronics to control the shutter and and the aperture on the lens ... Some different options: - My best plan: get Sony to make 30 x 45 mm translucent mirror reflecting 0,5-0,75 stops of light to a 5-10 MP sensor that would give us all the information we need in an electronic viewfinder, of course with a fast processor on board the camera to control on sensor PDAF, exposure and all that. We could use the basic S camera design for this and place the translucent mirror where the flapping mirror is now. - Another route and probably the easiest way would be to get someone to make an adapter for the Minolta or CaNikon mount film-DSLRs of yore and be done with it, but then we're stuck to small format. - Use the basic S design with mirror box and all but put a film transport mechanism where the sensor is now. This could be roll film or small format so we could make some kind of mini Hasselblad X-Pan with 24x45mm. - Somehow use the L-Mount all the way into the corners and get a 30x45mm negative and have lots of other lens options available for analog shooting?

Interesting juxtaposition of buildings here including the ladder and drain pipes. The 42mm lens really shines in a photo like this.Also your exposure is spot on. I think that Tri-X is a perfect film for the UR Replica Sorry about the mixup about the film. As for you shutter curtain repair, remember that the diameter of the shutter drum with wound on shutter curtain is critical! When one collapses the lens there is a very small gap between the lens barrel stop and the barrel with shutter curtain. As long as your repairs were not in the middle of the curtain, there will be no problem. As a general rule I always advance the film, thus decreasing the shutter drum diameter, before I collapse the lens into the body. In this way you minimize the chance of rubbing the lens barrel stop flange against the shutter curtain. If this happens, you will see a little of the copper as a smudge on the curtain material. This was one of the challenges that Mr. Kim had with the first UR Replica that he made. The space inside the camera body is very limited. This is especially true with the shutter barrel. Mr. Kim made a few barrels before he got the diameter right. Even then he warned me to be very careful when collapsing the the lens into the body. A smaller diameter shutter curtain barrel was not possible as there is a critical spring inside the barrel. The small diameter of the shutter barrel also minimized the chance of shutter bounce and also since inertia was minimized, there was little lag in the acceleration of the shutter when you press the shutter button. I always wondered if Barnack had the same problem and did he solve it in the same manner as Mr. Kim. Would be very interesting to know what the diameter of the shutter curtain barrel is in the original UR Camera of 1913-4.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/138638-working-ur-leica/page/10/?tab=comments#comment-3666761", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "138638-working-ur-leica", "result": false, "Selector": "i did make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i did make a mistake, reloading the first -----> roll !!!

I cherished this camera so much...\" If you feel that strongly about your M8, don't sell it. You will end up regretting it. There is something to be said for the \"if you're not using it, sell it and get something you want or need\" school of thought. I am at present going through that with my Hasselblad XPAN II film camera. I have always liked the XPAN as it is unique in the world of photography. I have not used it much over the years, though. I enjoy developing my own film, but it is damn hard due to physical problems with my hands. My M-P 240 has taken over my photographic endeavors the past few years. The image quality of my prints is outstanding and digital workflow is so much more easy than that of film. So I sold my XPAN II kit on Ebay to fund the purchase of a Q2. I still have the XPAN here at home, as I'm waiting for the buyer's bank to get its act together and let him pay me for it. Packing it up for shipping it pulled at my heart strings pretty hard - but not having money to burn, this is the only way to pay for the Q2 which I'm certain will get alot more use than my XPAN ever did. From where I stand, \"if you're not using it, sell it and get something you want or need\" is a good philosophy but you have to operate with caution so you don't end up breaking your own heart. One piece of gear that I truly cherish is my 50mm f/1.0 Noctilux. I will never even think of selling it. There is no other lens in existence that does what it does IMHO. That lens is my holy grail, my beloved. She is here to stay and has been since 2008. I have never had that attachment to my XPAN, so I think that even though parting with it sucks, the Q2 will ease the pain of loss. Best of luck with your decision on the M8.

The difficulty with color negative is that while RA4 paper has been designed to render a good neutral baseline for the film, when you scan it, you have to account for the orange mask. Scanners and cameras have a much harder time of it, as they have not been designed to deal with it. A simple inversion of the negative will yield extremely blue/cyan images. While you can just try to compensate for it in photoshop, there is more going on than just white balance, so special software can help, be it the scanner software itself, or third party programs like I mentioned. In my experience, ColorPerfect gives the best baseline image in most cases. It is a bit counter-intuitive to use, but it seems to get the most natural colors in one click as compared to FlexColor (which I use in the X5), Negative Lab Pro (which I downloaded as a trial). I have not used Silverfast, EpsonScan or Vuescan extensively, but from what I hear from photographer's I trust, ColorPerfect gives the best result, despite the challenges of the workflow.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/304421-scanning-6x6-hasselblad/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3874275", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "304421-scanning-6x6-hasselblad", "result": false, "Selector": "we make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i think it is not so much the -----> film !!!  that is the problem, it is the ways that we make it into a digital file that are the issue.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 99387, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Doc Henry", "date": "2019-12-16 14:09:00", "content": " Stuart since 2014 I develop myself all films b&w or color , a great pleasure and with my Leica cameras ( and sometimes I in light difficult situation I need my Gossen lighmeter) Really I don't correct my pictures.

But to tell the truth, I am not able at all to see any difference on my scans or prints on photo paper between the Delta 400 and the Tmax 400. To me they all look the same. In many cases it is not a decision between these films it depends on what I have in my fridge. And when I think that I need more grain, I use the Tmax 3200 with 1000 or 1600. Thats all. I think it is a difficult discussion and especially when you look in the \"I like film\" thread you see photos with a completely different grain and look, but they were taken with the same film.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/294528-tmax-400-more-preferred-than-tri-x-among-leica-users/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3693742", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "294528-tmax-400-more-preferred-than-tri-x-among-leica-users", "result": false, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i develop the -----> films !!!  by myself, but i hate scanning.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 102706, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "jmahto", "date": "2019-03-02 05:24:00", "content": "21 hours ago, PaulJohn said: With\ufeff s\ufeffcanning it's a good idea to avoid all image processing at the s\ufeffcan stage and do it later in full control of the affe\ufeffc\ufeff\ufefft\ufeffs.

On my last roll of film, which I developed as usual in a Paterson tank, i used a real acidic stop bath (a solution using alcohol vinegar) rather than water and a hypo clearing agent (a fresh solution using sodium sulfite). Most of the roll was good, but on the following uninteresting shot you can see the type of blotching that I'm talking about: --img--  I developed the neg with Kodak D-76 for the required time (11 min for Ilford Delta 100 @ 20 degrees C), then added the stop bath for 30 seconds, then fixed for 10 minutes with standard Kodak fixer (perhaps too long? i was worried the fixer was getting old). I then washed the neg for 5 minutes under running water with just the spool in the open tank, bathed it for 5 min in the sodium sulfite solution, then washed for a further 5. Further, I gave 40 rotations of the tank (a la a partial Ilford method) in carbon filtered water. Then a minute to soak in a second bath of filtered water with a few drops of dish washing detergent. Any ideas where I might me going wrong? This is the first time that I've used an acidic stop bath with film and the first time I've used sodium sulfite. The result above is however fairly typical of other poor results that I've had in the past. Perhaps I should wash for longer but our water bills are huge.... I can't yet connect a hose to the tap in my darkroom (a bathroom) but will be doing that in the future so I can use the A. Adams method of forcing the water up from the bottom of the tank, rather than having running water entering from the top. I guess it could be the dish washing detergent, but i don't know.

By results, I mean contrast, grain, and sharpness. Specifically regarding FP4 and grain, will there be a big difference between using DD-X or Ilfotec HC? Once I make the four liters of stock solution, how long of shelf life should I expect? At 1+31 I'll probably have enough developer to last years since I've been averaging about three rolls of film per month.

Thanks, Patrick I just watched the video again to remind myself as it was over a year ago that I created my profiles. I think it's the part at 6 minutes into the video that you refer to.

It has never been simple, and practice/experience is key... as with all other aspects of photography. Jeff I agree. A test print is always needed...and very careful assessment.. dodging, burning, colour assessment...you might even find a sensor blob which needs cloning (too late if you've printed a huge expensive print). It is a bit easier now. In my darkroom days a good final print might take a few hours to create...and expensive. I use paper and inks which suit my printer Epson 3000...now never any aftermarket stuff. I print with LightRoom...can't stand it really but got used to it. The Epson printing software is very less than average. So print a proof knowing it to be so...and do a critical assessment. ...", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/299410-best-photo-print-software/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3881688", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "299410-best-photo-print-software", "result": false, "Selector": "i have never made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "on 7/19/2019 at 10:06 pm, jeff s said: i have never made a final (framed for display) print without first making work prints, -----> film !!!  or digital.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 112549, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "farnz", "date": "2019-08-24 19:14:00", "content": "By the way, in case anyone's not familiar with the Black Country Living Museum, it's not just a dusty old building full of glass cabinets containing eccentric articles and haughty, long-winded explanations, it's a large estate containing a 'live' village from Victorian(?) times that are staffed by knowledgeable and friendly people in period dress.
