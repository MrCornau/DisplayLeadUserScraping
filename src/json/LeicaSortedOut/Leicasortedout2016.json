All went well. As I do with all my cameras (of various brands), I set the time to match my computer's to the second. I made a time reference shot today to time synchronize several cameras used for a shoot, and for the first time in my use of Leica digital M cameras, the camera did not 'time drift' even after a couple days. Previously, the M240's clock would run fast and even a few days later would be 30 seconds to a minute too fast. I would have to shoot time sync photos as soon as possible for every multi-camera shoot to ensure I could accurately sync the Leica with the other cameras (I photograph the clock on my computer and compare it, to the second, against the time recorded to the image in EXIF).

I was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. I put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of positions by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so I bit. Shooting Leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and I have shot with every mainline production M I can think of, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M4-2, M4-P, M6, M6TTL, M7, MP, M-A, M8, M8.2, M9P, Monochrom, M-P240, M246, and M262. Still, the screen-less Leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. I have had the chance to shoot my M-D for one day at Universal Studios Hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in Orlando, Florida. During this time, I averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. I shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. I attached the new 35mm/2.0/ASPH/II lens and an E39 UVa and didn\u2019t look back. The camera shoots like an M7. It meters like an M7, focuses like an M7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that I developed with my M7. The big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable ISO dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an M7 without changing rolls of film. Having any speed film from 200-6400 ISO at the twist of a dial is very handy. The rest of the body works like an M7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. All in all, an excellent handling design. O.K., there is one tiny new item I need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. Luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. The shutter sound is discrete like an M should be, very much like the one in the M262, which has the current best M digital shutter. Several aspects of performance warrant discussion. First and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. The default compressed DNG files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. The second area worth note is the metering. The pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cClassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. Metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. The solution is what I term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. You simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. Using this approach, I achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. The slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. The continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. Battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. These numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. I did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and I would up with a dead battery one morning. I would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. The M-D comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. I would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. This is no MP black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the Kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. Other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. It wrote every single image I took to SD card without error, something no other M digital I have owned can claim. It really is that good. If I were to make two changes, I would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current Off/S/C/Timer. I did overachieve and put the camera into Continuous mode when I wanted Single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. Oh, and did I mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital Ms I\u2019ve purchased since 2006? Not a speck of dust! I did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named Kevin who has made a career out of photography. He loves his M\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of Canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. I explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. I caught him chimping the ISO dial a few times, and when I commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and I need to get me one of these (M-D).\u201d Kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and I would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. This, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. The M-D is up to the task. So, who should buy this camera? This is a little bit hard to define. The camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable.

 -----> developed !!!  with my m7. the big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable iso dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an m7 without changing rolls of film. having any speed film from 200-6400 iso at the twist of a dial is very handy. the rest of the body works like an m7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. all in all, an excellent handling design. o.k., there is one tiny new item i need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. the shutter sound is discrete like an m should be, very much like the one in the m262, which has the current best m digital shutter. several aspects of performance warrant discussion. first and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. the default compressed dng files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. the second area worth note is the metering. the pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cclassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. the solution is what i term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. you simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. using this approach, i achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. the slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. the continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. these numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. i did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and i would up with a dead battery one morning. i would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. the m-d comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. i would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. this is no mp black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. it wrote every single image i took to sd card without error, something no other m digital i have owned can claim. it really is that good. if i were to make two changes, i would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current off/s/c/timer. i did overachieve and put the camera into continuous mode when i wanted single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. oh, and did i mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital ms i\u2019ve purchased since 2006? not a speck of dust! i did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named kevin who has made a career out of photography. he loves his m\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. i explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. i caught him chimping the iso dial a few times, and when i commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and i need to get me one of these (m-d).\u201d kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and i would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. this, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. the m-d is up to the task. so, who should buy this camera? this is a little bit hard to define. the camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable. it should be durable enough to last for decades. i would expect the batteries and sd cards will be the lifespan-limiting commodities, not the m-d. if you want a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d leica m digital for still images only, and have at least some skill with m cameras, this is an excellent selection, and could be your only m. if you need to work at the limits of m capabilities, lenses wider than 28 or longer than 90 (subjective), shoot macro, hold cameras overhead or away from your eye for perspective or safety,, shoot at f/0.95, or need to capture short video clips, then a \u2018240 may be a better tool, but don\u2019t forget the lessons the m-d and prior film m cameras teach us.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 19840, "year": "2016"}, {"autor": "Eastgreenlander", "date": "2016-06-11 18:56:00", "content": "So I have to wait until hours or days later to blame myself?

I'd like to share my small experience in lens coding. Now I have only two lenses: CZ C Sonnar 1.5/50 ZM and VM Color-Skopar 35/2.5 PII. Initial preparations took some time. I saw native Leica coded lenses and many DIY codes. Also I read some folks noticed some hand-made codes aren't readable by new cam bodies. So I decided to discover this topic deeply. I have M9 cam with straight reader. As well known M240/M262 have curved form reader. So I started to make drawings based on vector images from manuals and then moved to camera mount photos. I decided they're more real. I analyzed both type reader areas and found optimal point size and position to be read with both shapes of readers. I printed some amount of drawn mount templates on hard photo paper in a digital print service. The template had exact outer radius to fit with Leica and Zeiss lenses and lock mark. It's enough to position the template precisely on lens mount. Template has been cut out and temporary mounted to lens mount with double side stick tape. Then I started to drill slowly and accurate small holes with 1mm bit by fingers. The hard paper allows to avoid bit slipping in the very beginning. Then I removed the template and had noticeable holes. It's possible to continue with 1.5mm bit. During metering I measured an optimal diameter for point as 1.7mm. But 1.5mm bit OK as well due to relatively low diameter precision and a fluctuation during drilling. After I applied electric screw driver at low rotation rate and small drill time of each hole. I finished with 2mm bit in my fingers to make hole edges smooth. Sonnar was the first and very simple task due to it is recommended to code it as lux 50 asph. So it has only 1 left bit hole. That's it. The hole has been filled with black matte paint made by Revell I usually use to paint my railway models. --img--  Another deal was with Color-Skopar. Voigtlaender designers in some reason decided to put screw right at the end of 6-bit code --img--  After that I made a gutter from the screw hole towards mount edge.

I am parroting Leica. Thanks Jaap. Can you point to where they said this? I, for one, will not be collapsing any such lenses on Digital Ms. A study which I made recently indicated a degree of variation in barrel length in early Elmars. I did not look at the contemporary f2.5 Hektor, but the barrel on that seems even longer. It is not worth it to cause damage needlessly.

'm hoping some of you may be able to help. the idea is that the camera, using aperture priority, should pick a shutter speed equal to the iso value. instead, with spot metering, the shutter speeds are double the expected value: iso 100 : 1/200 iso 200 : 1/400 iso 400 : 1/800 etcetera with centre-weighted metering the results are different (though they should be the same, having taken care to fill the frame with the grey card): iso 100 : 1/160 iso 200 : 1/320 iso 400 : 1/640 etcetera now to make things even more complicated, i found that in manual mode, the on screen exposure meter reads zero at a third set of values: iso 100 : 1/125 iso 200 : 1/250 iso 400 : 1/500 etcetera with this final test, there was no difference between spot and centre-weighted metering, which presents us with yet another riddle... can anyone explain this? or try to replicate these results with their vario, just to rule out that i have a faulty item? also, i'd welcome advice about adjusting exposure strategies in light (pun intended) of these irregularities. i use spot metering most of the time, and my thinking about exposure is largely in terms of adams' zones. i have been shocked in my now three months with the camera how good the light meter is. after playing with my tenedency to \"underexpose\" a little (i have sigma cameras and always trying to avoid blowing the highlights), i have come to trust the x vario implicitly. the only change i like is a little extra shapening on the color raw images when needed. so perhaps you have a problem with the camera; again i am not an expert, but there is seems very little you have to do with an x vario image if correctly exposed. btw i shoot manual all the time.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 12323, "year": "2016"}, {"autor": "Manoleica", "date": "2016-05-23 21:33:00", "content": "Here is a convenient table of hyperfocal distances for the X Vario.

I didn't copy most of the suggestions provided by some of you, because I thought they were either unfeasible or low priority (sorry!). Now let's see what happens... I do hope Leica will allocate some resources to implement at least the most important improvements. We exchanged a few emails earlier, and I am taking the liberty to approach you again. After acquiring a second hand X2 last month, I now bought a new X Vario. I am positively stunned by the image quality. This camera is not much loved by many, but it deserves high praise! However, it also deserves\u2026 a 1.2 (or 2.0) firmware update. I know Leica would make many loyal X Vario users very happy (and even more loyal) with an update that would take care of the following things. A subset of these improvements would also be very welcome, to be sure, which is why I put the items in order of importance, as I see it. I also asked for improvement suggestions at the Leica forum, and it seems my initiative was well received there. Add exposure lock. Half-pressing the shutter button is not always an option, because the user may want to focus on a different part of the scene than the part that the exposure should be based on. When using spot for light metering in conjunction with manual focus, provide a mark at the center of the image so user knows which area is used for metering (the X2 has this). Make the six o\u2019clock position of the circular button on the back and the movie recording button both programmable, so user can set them to choosing user profile or light metering mode, or perhaps other functions. Make the self-timer stick (i.e. if user activates the self-timer, it should remain active until user selects normal shooting mode again). Allow the user to pick exactly which information is shown on the monitor/viewfinder while shooting, and add ISO and f-stop to the information that can be shown. For example, I\u2019d like to see the histogram, but not the rule of thirds grid. Allow user to choose to have the exposure bar (I mean the display feature showing light measurement in third stops relative to a zero point in the middle) visible at all times (now it disappears after about 12 seconds, which is inconvenient when using spot metering to measure different light values in a scene). Auto ISO in manual mode (added with firmware 1.1) should be optional, i.e. user should be able to have it turned off by default. Make the shutter speed adjustable in smaller increments through use of a button/dial. When using an incident light meter, precise shutter speed values sometimes need to be set on the camera. Get rid of the semi-transparent bars on top and bottom of the most information-rich display view. They obscure parts of the target frame, and seem to serve no real purpose. Change the histogram to the one seen on the X2 with the horizontal bar showing Adams\u2019 Zones. Improve live view to reflect the chosen exposure more accurately (when half-pressing the shutter button), and/or allow user to turn it off completely, making the viewfinder, whether LCD or EFV, function more like an optical viewfinder. Add preset film bracketing: let user choose two or three color reproduction styles, and let the camera produce these for each shot. The jpegs this camera produces are excellent, and for some situations, having film simulation bracketing would remove the need for shooting DNG. Add focus type (manual/auto) to the EXIF information written with the image files. Shorten the time elapsed before the camera is ready to shoot again when \u2018auto review\u2019 is sett to 'off\u2019. Enable user to enter basic copyright information that will be added to all images automatically. Leica is in a position to make this amazing camera even better.

After experience with X1/2/113 I totally agree with your review-update as I couldn\u00b4t create a characteristic Leica image from RAW : UPDATE: After receiving too many emails and messages asking me how some leica XVarior photographers \"me included\" mange to get images that good and color-rich from the XVario, some ventured to say that they don't even get close using their M or S system.... The answer is Right Exposure. After long experience in shooting and PP works for the magazine, i can tell you that the secret to a good picture, a picture that would preserve the look of the camera system you're using is the right exposure. But we can fix exposure error in post you may ask, ok yes, and with DND / RAW files you can do wonders but then, believe me, the look and characteristics of your Leica are gonna be gone! That however doe snot mean that the corrected image won't be good, it can come out beautiful, but it will lose the fingerprints of the camera that created it. Expose well, and you'll have breathtaking results. So the XVario seems to be perfect for me...

To explain, the 21-35 has marks in meters at infinity, 7, 3, 2, 1.2, etc. If you want to focus on a subject 7 meters away, set the lens to 3 meters; if you want to focus on a subject 3 meters away, set the lens to 2 meters. Focal lengths in between are roughly proportionate to their distance between 21mm and 35mm, so 28mm is about one-half mark closer than indicated. I didn't conduct exhaustive testing on this. (I took test images at each marked position on an M9-based Monochrom, at both feet and meter markers, as well as at each focal length, in a static frame with subjects at about 50 meters, 10 meters, and 5 meters away based on a satellite map. At that level of granularity, there were only slight differences between adjacent test images when viewed at 200% magnification on screen. I also took images of closer subjects using that same approach, although with only casual distance estimation, and the result was acceptably in focus.)

Fortunately I noticed, that unlike most lens hoods this version is made from two parts held together by three small screws, it should therefore be possible to remove the original hood part and replace it with a wider or longer (depending on when you were seeing the flare) version modified to fit the original screw part of the hood. I measured the thread at 64mm and plastic versions with thread of this size are available on sites like eBay. As they are plastic the thread could be easily removed and the hole left widened slightly to allow it to fit over the original thread and then be retained with the screws. Thank you Bob. I had not noticed the three screws on the thread anulus of the original hood - on mine the screw holes have been filled - presumably with wax - thus the actual tiny screws are under the wax. So yes it should be possible to remove them and attach the anulus to a larger hood. My home-made hood tended to fall off occasionally because the foam did not always grip tightly onto the original hood - so I've made a Mk II version --img--  This utilises an SRB 82mm threaded 105mm diameter wide angle hood - which has been extended by 12mm by securing (gluing) another section of detergent tub onto the front after first covering same with self adhesive valour. The detergent tub is conical so there's a matching 105mm-ish section where its diameter matches that of 105mm diameter SRB hood. To attach the WA hood's 82mm thread to the lens' female 65mm* hood thread, requires stepping rings. I'm using 82mm to 77mm, plus 77mm-67mm \u2026 and have ordered a 67mm to 65mm from Russia - the only source found offering 65mm stepping rings. The 12mm extension length was ascertained by trial and error i.e. by gradually cutting back to a length which does not cause any vignetting at small apertures. I measured the OEM Leica lens hood attachment thread as 65mm* \u2026 but if as you state it's 64mm will have to source another 67mm to 64mm stepping ring \u2026 or remove the annulus from the original hood and screw it onto another plastic anulus secured onto the 82mm hood. I do not have any 64mm or 65mm diameter filters or accessories to check the actual diameter of the lens' outer hood thread. This might appear to some to be a lot of effort but once secured properly it will enable flare free imaging in those situations where there are a lot of extraneous nocturnal illuminations e.g. fairgrounds, city centres, seafront promenades, and particularly London's West End where there's a wealth of interesting night-time subjects. Unfortunately the lens' 60mm filter thread cannot be utilised to attach an accessory hood because at the 70mm zoom setting the lens front is pulled inside the lens mount - thus anything attached of wider diameter compromises focusing. The lens' original Leica hood is rather too small to be effective in all situations - but it was designed to be reversible which enables easy storage.

Let's just deconstruct this statement shall we? \"Living abroad\" suggests that the starting point is Germany and German law. I don't \"live abroad\", I live in my home and my domestic law applies to me. If I enter into a contract here, typically my (local) laws apply to me - now, that may mean as a part of my local laws (conflict of laws), a contract to supply a German magazine under an online subscription is governed by German Law, or it might not. Generally, when transacting online, the applicable law is not the law where the material is loaded or an offer made, but the law applicable to the person who accesses the material. So, if I make a share offer (or similar) from here in New Zealand, and a person from the US accesses that offer, I have to comply with the US consumer protection legislation and all the rather more complex legislation relating to share offers and prospectuses at State and Federal level. Similarly, if I say something offensive to you which is defamatory in the UK, and is accessed in the UK, I can get dragged before the UK courts to answer for my defamatory remarks (though the UK has recently restricted such forum shopping). The general approach with online commerce is that the law of the person accessing the material (rather than the one loading it) applies - under that law, the parties may agree to German or other law applying, but there will be limits. So, back on topic, many countries have unsolicited mail legislation (we certainly do) where if I get sent a magazine, book or anything else without asking for it, I can keep it, I don't have to return it and I do not have to pay for it (a generalisation, but you get the picture). Whether or not LFI can require cancellation of a subscription in order to stop supplies around the globe is questionable. It might be legal in Germany, but I'd be surprised if that was the case in all countries where they post it. Local consumer protection legislation usually prevails. On a final note, I think it is sophistry to describe LFI as much more than a promotional publication for Leica. Like Pop, I recall Leica (or ACM) taking ownership of the magazine, and if you think companies are not answerable to their shareholders you might like to think again. The entire driving force for many company take-overs is to get hold of technology ... If that doesn't convince you, show me the last time LFI published an article on something not made by Leica (it is Leica Fotographie after all) or when it was at all critical of a Leica product. I can't be bothered looking for it, but did they say anything about the EVF offered with the M(240), its slow refresh rate, black out on shutter release (they didn't mention this about the T, and that was the main reason I sold mine) or any other Leica issue or failing?

After speaking with him for a while he told me about the new firmware 3.40 and how amazing the xpro1 was after the new firmware Ahhh... the venerable XPro-1... the camera that drove me back to Leica because it missed focus as often as 2 out of 3 of the shots... If autofocus is important to you, then you shouldn't even be considering an M body. You just won't be happy with it. I wanted to like the XPro-1. I had it for several months. I tried to make it do what I wanted it to do, but it just wasn't up to the task. It didn't have an optical rangefinder, and there was no way to focus it using the optical rangefinder... and autofocus was abysmal. So, I dumped it and paid the price of admission back to Leica. ... but, it's not a rangefinder. Which is why is foolish to compare the M bodies and the Fuji bodies. The ONLY thing they have in common is that both have an optical viewfinder. Past that, there's nothing that they share in common. I have had an X-T1 now for a year and a half or so, and it's a perfect complementary body to the M9P I have... but neither can substitute for the other.

I rarely make giant prints and I'm pretty good in Photoshop but I dont think locking my camera at ISO200 and adjusting for every shots exposure for best result first is a method of shooting I can adopt? I will make more tests as you all given me something too think about. It's the 2 or 3 stops under exposed thing that doesn't make sense when I have the tools 400 to 1600 available to me? Currently I do fix exposure first in Post but never the extreme of 2 or 3 stops ...those, I throw away. Anybody else have to think twice when typing ISO?....I always want to write ASA and there is the reason I think the way I do Hep I like your Silo...you live in an very interesting part of the country ...neat stuff sand I do always appreciate you help and advice Hey thanks, Evan. And yes, I've never fully tumbled to ISO either... ASA is still where it's at in my head. That said, \"right or wrong\" all you're doing when you dial up the ISO on your Leica is fooling the meter into thinking that there's more light than there is. There may be some electronic wizardry going on in the processor, but the sensor records at ISO 200 regardless of what you set the ISO at... unlike film whose sensitivity actually varied with the emulsion formulation. So, you can blithely twirl the ISO dial all you want... and let the electronics figure out what to do with the signal, or you can mentally calculate how many stops you're off, and make the exposure. Twiddling the ISO will make the .jpg look properly exposed, and it'll be pleasing on the LCD and make you smile, but it won't give you a .dng image with the least amount of noise possible. And don't worry... I've known about this since the dawn of digital sensors and I still have a tough time wrapping my head around it when I'm actually taking an exposure. And frankly, in most cases I'm not sure that there's enough difference between what's recorded at ISO 200 and ISO 800 to worry about it... My point, though, is still that ISO is a dated film concept that has no valid application on a sensor past its base sensitivity. Everything else is done by a processor and signal-to-noise amplifier. ISO is merely a device for fooling a light meter and letting old guys like us think in terms we're used to. If digital cameras didn't have a variable ISO setting when they were introduced, no one would have bought them because we'd all have thought we were locked into whatever the base sensitivity of the sensor is. Well, we are... but the manufacturers let us think we aren't, and let us use our meters and all three exposure settings anyway as if we weren't. The Lytro camera is another thing I just can't get my head around... changing perspective and focus in an image that's already captured? There are concepts coming down the pike that just don't fit the ideas that we older guys have about imaging... I recently bought a Mamiya AFDii outfit... I've had it a couple of weeks, and I'm going to resell it because I just bought a Mamiya 645 pro outfit that still has the manual dials I'm used to. I used to like to play with the new stuff... and I don't any more. It's not because I can't figure it out, I just don't want to. I'd rather make images the way I'm already comfortable with rather than have to learn a new process before I can make the same images. The evolution of technology is a two-edged sword. There's cool new stuff... but rather than learning it, I'd rather spend my time doing making images instead of figuring out how to use new the technology. Perhaps that's the tempering that comes with maturing?

ETTR is an interesting concept but ..... The problem is that once you have a contrast range which the sensor cannot accommodate you have to decide how your exposure should best be made - i.e. at what level are you prepared to have your highlights burn out. And the reason ETTR doesn't always work is because its another metering method which you can use IF its appropriate and of course it isn't always appropriate and it has to be used intelligently too. The basic problem we have is that increasing ISO is simply turning up the amplification and of course noise is boosted too. I've assumed that so far camera manufacturers have tuned their in-camera software to adjust for increased ISO so that the resulting files are optimised. But post processing software has become so good that this really isn't required anymore IMO anyway. And things will no doubt evolve further. I've come from a film background but it has always struck me that 'digital sensitivity' described in terms of ISO (and digital ISO has a technical definition) was always an odd way of doing things and rather backward looking. Backward because digital sensors do not have characteristic curves like film - and are interpreted in a different way. So using ISO as sensitivity cannot be the best solution. I would like to see RAW files 'tagged' with an optimum ISO at which they should be interpreted by software rather than embedded with it so that it cannot be undone, which appears to be the case at present. A different way of looking at things and one which won't appeal to everyone, but there you go. And FWIW I DO shoot at base ISO all the time and rely of software to adjust - its not theory, its how I use my Leicas and it can work effectively, but its a slower way of operating relevant only if it suits your RAW workflow.

Much here was gleaned from the great RED article as linked to on the first page, and the \u201cISOless M240\u201d blog entry. Information and ObservationsThe M240 CMOS sensor has a base ISO - and fixed sensitivity - of 200.The M240 CMOS sensor has a latitude of (something like) thirteen stops [a number I\u2019ve floated which has not yet been corrected; someone out there knows the real number].Manually changing the ISO number does not affect the sensitivity of the sensor.Manually changing the ISO number changes the way the software handles the light meter.Manually changing the ISO number changes the way the software manages the data the sensor receives, sometimes in negative ways.The light meter indicates (something like) a five stop range.The histogram indicates that the camera has (something like) a seven stop range.Conclusions The M240 (and not, obviously, exclusively), through the transition to digital, limits us to an apparent seven stops of latitude, while the sensor is capable of registering thirteen stops. Running the camera at ISO 200, and relying on the meter and histogram as programmed, effectively forces the photographer to rely only on the upper seven stop's sensitivity of the sensor; as the ISO is nudged up, the seven stops are effectively forced further down the sensitivity of the sensor. ISO is vestigial thinking from the days of film, a static imposition of false limits; Sensor Latitude, although fixed, allows the photographer full access to the potential of the sensor.Current camera and metering software compromises image quality because of adherence to tradition: the perpetuation of the idea that a sensor\u2019s sensitivity can be changed, as film could (roll by roll).A new way of thinking about light and sensitivity, and a meter that reflects the technical changes in exposure-reading and picture-taking, are required.Utilizing the base ISO, and using the meter only to ensure that all desired data falls within the thirteen-stop range of the sensor, with proper exposure managed in post-production, is, technically, a superior method of exposure.ProposalI propose a light meter (fixed at base ISO) that examines a scene in its entirety (per lens in use), displays a graphic indication of the range of light - the number of stops - present in the image, and what combinations of aperture & shutter speed will allow the appropriate quantity of light to reach the sensor, so that data is registered across the range of the sensor. This light meter would indicate clearly where a scene\u2019s range of light exceeds the capacity of the sensor (fifteen stops range in a scene, against a sensor that only manages thirteen stops). Cameras would chimp a full-sensor-range image, along with full-sensor-range histogram. All curves/tonality would be managed in post-processing.I would also suggest that Lux be adopted as the new standard by which we, as photographers, think about light: to learn to think and see in Lux, which can then be converted into exposure. That committed digital photographers unlearn ISO.I suggest that camera manufacturers eliminate ISO as a tool for exposure, and integrate Sensor Latitude into the software and processing of images.

I haven't posted here before, mainly because I don't use a Leica - always been fearful that, were I to take a leap into your world, I would get hooked and it would become very expensive!I am extremely disappointed to read a couple of the posts on this thread because my staff and myself work extremely hard here to offer an excellent service. As far as I am aware, we are the only lab in the UK currently investing seriously in our lab business, and, we continue to grow our film processing, scanning and printing volumes - to the point where we have recently had delivered another Noritsu 37 series printer and we are having a new HS-1800 scanner currently made for us in Japan to go with this - these will be operational within the next 4 weeks or so. This is in addition to other investments we have made in the last 9 months including the commissioning of 50\" C-Type print service with the Lightjet and 50\" autopan processor and the introduction of a Flextight X5 scanner. This sort of investment is only possible because we offer a high quality service, through which we can grow the business and retain customers. If there is something someone doesn't like, then, obviously, it's extremely important to me that we address this. I am only interested in offering a top quality service, but competitively priced, because of our reliance on the latest, most efficient, equipment and our low clerical overhead. Our customer base includes a huge range of photographers, from beginners all the way to the likes of Magnum members, fine art exhibitions etc. I had intended to start sending films to UKFilmLab but they're moving to BC, Canada. Can anyone suggest a UK colour film processing and scanning service which provides the same sort of service i.e. not just sending the film through the scanner on auto but personally monitoring and maximising each frame's scan? I'm sick and tired of duff scans from the usual budget labs i.e. Peak Imaging, AG Photographic, Snaps etc. Has anyone tried Photographique? I can't say I'm impressed by the few samples on the website. Any other suggestions? I don't want to scan my holiday photos myself. Pete Pete - I have three guys here who judge every image manually, whether it be for scan or print. All three of them are extremely experienced. If you feel you have had a \"duff\" scan, our policy would always be to fix it. Did you contact us? We may have a competitive price, but this is because we have efficient plant and systems, NOT because we cut corners. Please feel free to contact me directly and we will re-scan or scan a film for you FOC. Pete - I was using UKFilmLab for C41 & E6 processing & high-res .jpgs having despaired of AGPhoto and Peak Imagings' dust & spot-ridden negs/slides (which I scanned with my V700 then spent ages 'spotting'). When they announced the move to Canada they mentioned that postal costs etc would still be competitive. IIRC, they should be up and running by the end of the month - why not see what their costs actually are? Keith - the last order I can find for you is from January this year where we processed 1 roll of E6 for you. After we sent the \"dispatched\" email, you responded that you had already received the film, and scanned it, and commended us with the words \"Excellent service\". I don't see how this squares with your statement above, and we have not heard from you since, or before, in respect of any problem. Please contact me to let us rectify any issues? We are more than willing to do so. I think if you are going to post such a message, on a public forum, without first contacting us, it is grossly unfair and completely disproportionate. In terms of E6, we regularly process a sack load of E6 120 film for a couple of well known landscape photographers - who also scan all their own film - we have never had any complaints or problems. If anyone wants to contact me privately I can put you in touch with them. This is in addition to numerous other customers, all of whom have very high standards.

I should have begun with \"Don't get me started\" - too late, Michael - You are a true film photographer through and through. I wish I could have your end to end workflow. Thanks for your post. Adam, I think you are mistaken in implying that \"non-professional grade\" film is necessarily (and meaningfully) inferior to film which says \"professional\" on the box. When I shoot colour film, I choose the film based on the colour characteristics and look that I am after (taking into consideration the light that I am shooting in). This means I might choose \u00a31 \"Poundland\" film instead of \u00a37 Portra. If I am prioritising minimising grain, I may choose Ektar. (As a sidenote, I have been experimenting with converting Ektar to B&W and am considering using it as a relatively grain free C41 alternative to XP2 or Fuji Neopan 400CN.) I really don't think there are any duff films out there nowadays, at least not ones made by Kodak or Fuji, just different palettes and grain characteristics. In fact, were I keen on a \"lo-fi\" aesthetic (a perfectly acceptable objective, if that's someone's thing) I'd probably be a bit disappointed that what is generally available is all a bit too good. Ian - thanks for your reply. I am not sure that you responded squarely to my question, which was whether you'd use non pro-grade film as a general workflow. It sounds like you use non-pro film on certain occasions. It is not clear, though, how often this is. What does the poundland film give you that a portra doesn't do better? This is not a sarcastic or rhetorical question by any means. It seems that you've used it with great results and I'd love your insights. Btw, you might try the Ilford Pan-F 50 for the low grain B&W alternative. I find the tonality wider and richer than the Ektar converted... With all the sophisticated post-processing tools, the answer is \"Why not use so-called non-professional film stock.\" Motion picture people do it as a regular practice. Think more, type less. . I have found that - as a general matter - non-pro film stocks don't scan as well and aren't as malleable as pro-film stocks.

As mentioned above, I don't see any dud films out there at the moment - Just different renderings. Cheers, Eoin Hi Eoin - great thoughts. I really appreciate it. You've set forth a number of factors that MAY come into play. But I guess I am asking what specific fact pattern would exist that would justify using non-pro film stocks on a LEICA with top optics. By non-pro films, I am referring to those film stocks on today's market that are at least half the price of the portras or fuji pro 400H. Examples are Kodak Gold or UltraMax, Fuji Superia, and Agfa Vista. It is a little difficult to imagine that there is a critical mass of people who will purchase a Leica camera and a good Leica lens yet can't afford to pay $4 more for the roll of film. I suppose that I can imagine a situation in which a person inherits the gear or buys the gear really beat up. But I am talking really high level general. As far I can remember 'professional film' was cut from the center zones of the ~~1,5m wide layer rolls emulsion coated. Reason was a minimum lesser tolerance in layer and emulsion thickness. But it must have been less to zero compared with 'non professional', I never mentioned one. Thomas Very interesting insight, Thomas. Thanks for sharing it. I think your premise is flawed. When using legacy technology, why would cost be an overriding factor? People use old lenses for the very reason that they \"taint\" the image. Why would not someone like the way a so-called \"non professional\" film renders? Of course, there could be operational reasons as well, for instance if you live in a part of the world or even the country where the processing of the so called professional film is overly inconvenient to come by. Pop - I am not following you. Old Leica lenses are not inferior at all when to comes to film, and they are superior to many old non-Leica lenses. Not sure you grasped my premise, which is probably my fault for not making it clear. Totally see your \"operational reasons\" point; that makes perfect sense but my question was geared to those who have all film stocks readily available. Use a higher grade low grain film that gives good accurate colour reproduction and you can add grain or an alternative impressionistic colour palette in post processing. If you are working on a body of work ( as opposed to making disparate individual photographs) this has considerable advantages as it means you can tweak each image to conform to the overall look you want while at the same time being able to use a wider variety of film stock. So yes, use better film. And you get up in the morning and spend a day shooting, always with the prospect of an exceptional image, but you shoot on cheap film to save \u00a33. How much is your time worth? You can make an image more grainy, but you can't make it less grainy. You can make a sharp film stock softer, but you can't make a soft film stock sharper. So is cheap film fundamentally worth it, basically no. Is it worth it for fun, put it into a P&S as a second camera, yes. But if you are putting any sort of effort into your photography I think you need to use the best you can, you only get one chance. Steve Steve - with the exception of Doc Henry and possibly ManoLeica, I think we may be the lone \"pro-film stock snobs\" on the LUF forum. --img--  I agree with most of your post, but I disagree with the above if we are considering films in the context of a process, scan, edit/fiddle and print workflow. Suppressing grain and sharpening (an abused art if ever there was one) are simple processes with any of the more controllable plug-ins. However, you probably answer the op's question in the context of a tradional workflow of process and optical wet print where those options aren't availble and the different characteristics between film emulsions are marked. I have dozens of 35mm rolls of Fuji Superia, all long out of date, that were given away free with every film I used to take to a now defunct mini lab for processing and these films are perfectly good enough for a 'hybrid' workflow. It's ironic that with Ektar and the Portras we now have some of the best emulsions ever made. .

(usually on xp2). i am also interested and focused on b&w photography. i am much impressed by good colour photography, but i don't feel that a photograph is by definition better in colour. in fact i think b&w and colour photography are completely different media - and for he last 20 or so years i have concentrated on b&w. i also have a minor and non-crucial niggle with leica's digital m cameras. i like the wonderful viewfinder in my m3 and i am quite satisfied with the .72 viewfinder in my m2. the .68 viewfinder in the digital ms is going in the wrong direction for me. a purely personal opinion. back before the m8, i thought i would be tickled with a replacement digital back for my m3 and m2, a little like a mini version of the dmr unit - but that was always a pipe dream. i have a working darkroom that gets used 8-8 times per year. i like the process and challenge of making a silver gelatin print and getting it better and better. and then dry mounting, matting and framing it (it is important to get to a finished show-able picture). i understand about imaging software - i use pse and silverefex pro to play with images before making a silver print. but what i get from a negative in my focomat 1c projected onto ilford multigrade paper continues to generate both joy and prints that cannot be duplicated nor replaced, i believe. i should have begun with \"don't get me started\" - too late, michael - you are a true film photographer through and through. i wish i could have your end to end workflow. thanks for your post. adam, i think you are mistaken in implying that \"non-professional grade\" film is necessarily (and meaningfully) inferior to film which says \"professional\" on the box. when i shoot colour film, i choose the film based on the colour characteristics and look that i am after (taking into consideration the light that i am shooting in). this means i might choose \u00a31 \"poundland\" film instead of \u00a37 portra. if i am prioritising minimising grain, i may choose ektar. (as a sidenote, i have been experimenting with converting ektar to b&w and am considering using it as a relatively grain free c41 alternative to xp2 or fuji neopan 400cn.) i really don't think there are any duff films out there nowadays, at least not ones made by kodak or fuji, just different palettes and grain characteristics. in fact, were i keen on a \"lo-fi\" aesthetic (a perfectly acceptable objective, if that's someone's thing) i'd probably be a bit disappointed that what is generally available is all a bit too good. ian - thanks for your reply. i am not sure that you responded squarely to my question, which was whether you'd use non pro-grade film as a general workflow. it sounds like you use non-pro film on certain occasions. it is not clear, though, how often this is. what does the poundland film give you that a portra doesn't do better? this is not a sarcastic or rhetorical question by any means. it seems that you've used it with great results and i'd love your insights. btw, you might try the ilford pan-f 50 for the low grain b&w alternative. i find the tonality wider and richer than the ektar converted... with all the sophisticated post-processing tools, the answer is \"why not use so-called non-professional film stock.\" motion picture people do it as a regular practice. think more, type less. . i have found that - as a general matter - non-pro film stocks don't scan as well and aren't as malleable as pro-film stocks. i'm ignoring your other comment --img--  i think there are a few factors which make this a decision that is not just down to the individual, but may change in either direction over time and according to circumstance. some random considerations: opportunity cost (i) - how much disposable income does the person have at the time that they are making their film purchase? opportunity cost (ii) - what are they prioritising? despite the argument that it is pointless to use commercial quality film in a professional quality camera / lens combination, they can upgrade film at any time. what is their current \"focus\" for their shooting? if just starting or getting back into film, they may place more emphasis on building momentum of shooting than on archival quality. what is their intended final medium? if it is print, there may be greater weighting to maintaining highest quality throughout the critical path. if it is e-mailing jpegs, maybe less so. what do they like the look of? what are they trying to achieve with their capturing of the light? my daughter has a plethora of film cameras available, but currently likes shooting polaroids with her refurbished 600-type. if you like it - use it (also i wouldn't dare tell her that she's whacko). i'm sure there are many more factors that define what makes sense for an individual in a certain space and time. i know that, at 53 years old, what i like and dislike, and the reasoning that i apply to make such choices seem logical, varies by the hour. some things are not particularly logical (like driving a car that is capable of +200km/h speeds on roads that are restricted to 90km/h), but may still bring pleasure. on another note, what is the current definition of \"professional\" film (other than what is on the label)? my untrustworthy memory has it that kodak used to define it by a combination of greater qa/qc in production (ie increased number of test samples per batch), and storage temperature control, but not by the emulsion itself. any of you people who have much greater experience and / or less faulty memories? is there a reference document (google was not my friend on this one - google suggested that i spend time watching jean reno in \"l\u00e9on: the professional\")? as mentioned above, i don't see any dud films out there at the moment - just different renderings. cheers, eoin hi eoin - great thoughts. i really appreciate it. you've set forth a number of factors that may come into play. but i guess i am asking what specific fact pattern would exist that would justify using non-pro film stocks on a leica with top optics. by non-pro films, i am referring to those film stocks on today's market that are at least half the price of the portras or fuji pro 400h. examples are kodak gold or ultramax, fuji superia, and agfa vista. it is a little difficult to imagine that there is a critical mass of people who will purchase a leica camera and a good leica lens yet can't afford to pay $4 more for the roll of film. i suppose that i can imagine a situation in which a person inherits the gear or buys the gear really beat up. but i am talking really high level general. as far i can remember 'professional film' was cut from the center zones of the ~~1,5m wide layer rolls emulsion coated. reason was a minimum lesser tolerance in layer and emulsion thickness. but it must have been less to zero compared with 'non professional', i never mentioned one. thomas very interesting insight, thomas. thanks for sharing it. i think your premise is flawed. when using legacy technology, why would cost be an overriding factor? people use old lenses for the very reason that they \"taint\" the image. why would not someone like the way a so-called \"non professional\" film renders? of course, there could be operational reasons as well, for instance if you live in a part of the world or even the country where the processing of the so called professional film is overly inconvenient to come by. pop - i am not following you. old leica lenses are not inferior at all when to comes to film, and they are superior to many old non-leica lenses. not sure you grasped my premise, which is probably my fault for not making it clear. totally see your \"operational reasons\" point; that makes perfect sense but my question was geared to those who have all film stocks readily available. use a higher grade low grain film that gives good accurate colour reproduction and you can add grain or an alternative impressionistic colour palette in post processing. if you are working on a body of work ( as opposed to making disparate individual photographs) this has considerable advantages as it means you can tweak each image to conform to the overall look you want while at the same time being able to use a wider variety of film stock. so yes, use better film. and you get up in the morning and spend a day shooting, always with the prospect of an exceptional image, but you shoot on cheap film to save \u00a33. how much is your time worth? you can make an image more grainy, but you can't make it less grainy. you can make a sharp film stock softer, but you can't make a soft film stock sharper. so is cheap film fundamentally worth it, basically no. is it worth it for fun, put it into a p&s as a second camera, yes. but if you are putting any sort of effort into your photography i think you need to use the best you can, you only get one chance. steve steve - with the exception of doc henry and possibly manoleica, i think we may be the lone \"pro-film stock snobs\" on the luf forum. --img--  i agree with most of your post, but i disagree with the above if we are considering films in the context of a process, scan, edit/fiddle and print workflow. suppressing grain and sharpening (an abused art if ever there was one) are simple processes with any of the more controllable plug-ins. however, you probably answer the op's question in the context of a tradional workflow of process and optical wet print where those options aren't availble and the different characteristics between film emulsions are marked. i have dozens of 35mm rolls of fuji superia, all long out of date, that were given away free with every film i used to take to a now defunct mini lab for processing and these films are perfectly good enough for a 'hybrid' workflow. it's ironic that with ektar and the portras we now have some of the best emulsions ever made. . steve - as i noted above, i personally don't get the same editing capability out of the non pro-film stocks. that said, i don't know how it use ps and don't have a drum scanner. ektar + m6 or r6.2 = a great combination.. right on!! ektar all the way!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 101281, "year": "2016"}, {"autor": "wattsy", "date": "2016-02-21 14:51:00", "content": "Yes, I wish I hadn't bought so much Portra because it is taking up freezer space I could use for other film. :-) I take your word about the data sheets but I simply make my preference based on what I see.

Film has a fixed 'colour temperature' so if you shoot daylight film in artificial light you either use a correction filter at the time or correct it later in scanning or printing. It's got nothing to do with whether or not your box of film says 'pro' or how much you pay for it. I'm struggling to understand what you're trying to get at here. James - my examples were simply a response to a request to show how portra doesn't make skin an ugly orange in artificial light. And I didn't use filters or make material WB adjustments in them. I am not trying to \"get at\" anything with this thread. I constructed a thesis and then posed a question. So far, the only answer that makes sense to me is that a person may want to use non-pro film to attain an amateur cheap drug store look (or as some might characterize as a traditional non-clean old fashioned mainstream film look). That is fine as far as it goes, but it isn't a mainstream answer IMO. I cannot say that I agree with the qualification \"drug-store look\"for film as such. The look you refer to is more generated by the processing than by the film. The main difference between Pro film and Consumer film is the greater attention to the colour response curve between the film batches and better attention to controlling the ripening process of the emulsion. Consumer films are made to have less rigorous colour fidelity control and can be stored longer in adverse conditions because of wider tolerances. Obviously each film, be it pro or consumer, will have its own character. That is a purely personal matter of taste, and there is no need to regard a photographer who prefers for instance Kodak Gold (which I personally rather dislike) as somehow inferior or not \"worthy of his gear\". Rather disrespectful in my book to do so. For instance, the only Ilford films marked \"professional\" are the three Deltas. But nobody in his right mind would call somebody using FP4+ or XP2Super in incompetent photographer. Jaap - please don't put words in my mouth. I am not criticizing or disrespecting a person or his or her photography acumen by what film he or she uses. I really think that you, with your heavy hand, have lambasted me unfairly. I am simply questioning the logic and rational of using the most expensive 35mm film gear to use non-pro film with the purpose of making amateur-looking old drug store film photos. Shiva gave me an answer which is that he likes the rangefinder mechanism. I could quibble with how he could save a lot of money and buy a different much cheaper brand of rangefinder to get the same sensation. But if someone likes the red dot so much and gets a rise out of clicking that shutter and using the RF, then to each his own, particularly if he is a Mercedes-driving doctor - who am I to judge that! So I think people need to avoid mixing issues. I may be questioning logic and cost-beneficial nature of using non-pro COLOR film; but I am in no way suggesting that people who use such film are inferior in any way shape or form - or criticizing them personally for doing what they do. I make irrational purchases and decision every single day. I do it b/c I want to and it makes me happy.

Given the fact that professional film stocks are up to double the price of consumer stocks, to say that they are not \"better\" in any way is going against capitalist market efficiency principles (it is also, btw, going against what the film companies say in their data sheets). This is not to say that it is an absolute fact that price=quality; but I do think that it gives rise to a presumption that needs to be rebutted..... Taking your points in reverse order: If price is automatically a sign of quality, then we can obviously just cancel next month's Kentucky Derby. We need only find out which horse commanded the highest price at auction (capitalist market principles) and award it the necklace of roses. It must be the best, correct? It's not a smart way to judge the world - if you want to know which film is best, or which horse is fastest, you don't compare prices, you run a race.

Philip: The improvements over Vuescan as I see them: - Silverfast seems to produce a flatter linear scan that doesn't clip at either end. Even when opened in Colorperfect it's very flat and boring - which is exactly what I want. Vuescan seems to me to introduce a curve even to the supposed flat linear scans; - Silverfast is much faster. I gave up doing multi-exposure with Vuescan long ago, both because it became INTOLERABLY slow on the 9000, but also I was afraid of the wear that might be involved on the machine: the scanner always seemed to be laboring so much more. Multiexposure in Silverfast seems to take about as long as single scan on Vuescan. Haven't strictly timed these impressions yet; - the scans have the TINIEST bit more visible detail. This is things like a tiny amount of fabric detail in a woven dress - barely visible only at 100%. When I look at the entire image on-screen, I feel like the added texture maybe helps the image. This is almost certainly my imagination. When I have time over the weekend I will try to post some comparison crops. You will need your spectacles to see the difference. The downsides: - I haven't been able to do a successful batch scan so far. With persistence I think I might get there sometime over the next few weeks; - all of the reasons I stated in the posts above - plus doubtless more rants to come; If I needed to buy the software separately for two scanners (almost \u20ac700!!!!) I would almost definitely NOT do it, no matter how many times Vuescan froze on me. Not so much the amount, but the principle would bug me far too much for a marginal improvement. The scariest thing is that the company has charged users the full price for upgrades - somewhere (typically I don't recall where) I read one user ranting about how they'd been forced to pay multiple full-price upgrades when Lasersoft finally managed to build a 64bit version of the app for modern OSes (several years after the competition). So even if you budget for a one-off expense, it may come back to bite you very hard in the future. PS: Just an aside - there's been occasional talk about financial trouble at the company - though all just rumor as I understand it. Considering the Quark-like nature of their business this wouldn't surprise me though. So maybe the whole edifice may collapse any time.

Here some results: --img--  --img--  --img-- I use ID-11 which is told to be basically the same as D76. After dissolving part B of the components, I never managed to get all powder completely dissolved. There are always some minor residuals, however on the data sheet this is being mentioned as normal. I alway wait until the next day before I use the stock solution. I always have a stock which I dilute 1:1 for single use, which gives consistent results. I recommend not to rinse with water after use of the stop bath. That doesn\u00b4t seem to make sense. There is no point in saving chemicals. Fixer isn\u00b4t too expensive. Yes your pictures are either overexposed or overdeveloped. I don\u00b4t have experience with D76 nor do I know anything about the film you used. I also restarted doing my own processing recently after 13 years of abstinence. I used to develop T-MAX in a rotational processor. I than restarted with TRI-X with Ilfosol and I was not so happy with the results. The negatives were far too dense. I now use Ilford FP4 plus and ID-11 and I am very pleased with the results! No rinsing in the beginning. I start with the developer immediately agitating 30 sec continuously at 20 C, thereafter twice every minute. The data sheet says 11min, I stop after 10:45 min because emptying of the drum takes a bit of time. Then stopping with 2% acidic acid 1 min, fixing 3 min and rinsing at about 20 C for about 20 min.

It did and it didn't. My developer was fresh and I used the maximum dilution of this anti fog stuff. I first printed from an Agfa Record Rapid 30X40 envelope graded hard.

I developed with again that same light only. The print was totally soft and the white edges around the images were totally medium grey. I ditched that envelope.

Used to shoot film in high school when I didn't really pay attention to photography as a medium, just a tool to keep some memories. Then, years later fell in love in video production and bought the canon 5dmk2 (that I finally sold two weeks ago). Having that camera helped me learn very fast so I started both shooting music videos and do photography, events and anything really. Not saying that I am a pro, I just get by doing projects I really like and fitting my hobby to become my second best work skill. My \"real job\" is leather craft. I have a small workshop here in Zagreb, Croatia. We used to make a lot of high quality stuff for police and security agencies, but I have expanded my field to a lot of custom work (custom stuff for harley bikes, musicians and lately photographers). That way the creative juices are always flowing. Combining high quality standards, durability and cool designs gets you long way... Of all my friends I got stuck on digital cameras for the longest time. Cause they used film for fun and research, while I was more or less working with my cams. At some point I did not know where the work stops and I needed a step back, slower gear... Manual focus lenses were the first slower gear. Every time I would travel to UK my camera bag was heavier and bigger and the basic kit I really needed was so simple. That I have solved with Sony a7s. A really cool little camera for work, but still the colors are a big problem there... This summer I finally decided to get a film camera for a trip my girlfriend and I was planning. We bought an old olympus OM10. We went to Tre Cime, Italy, and hiked a lot around Dolomites. We used both the canon and olympus and were so excited to get home and develop all the rolls. When we did that and compared the pics to the digital ones I just felt like all the time I was messing around in raw converter I was actually looking for this film photo. And not just that, a lot of the colors were not even present in the digital pics... The digital ones had more detail and they seem sharper and so, but film is something else... To cut the long story short. I have decided to get a decent film camera and Leica was my first choice along with the Hasselblad 500... Hass lost due its size. A couple weeks ago I decided to sell my canon to get some more traveling money (as I am going to USA for a month, to shoot pics and do some video) and a couple days later Leica M3 from 1955. knocks at my door.

I\u2019ve only just found this thread, in which I should have introduced myself some time ago - it's probably rather redundant to do so now, after I've made quite a few posts, but here goes anyway...... I am a musician (mainly in the opera world) and live in south London. I bought my first Leica, an M9P, just over two years ago, and it has transformed the pleasure I get from photography. I had my first camera, an Instamatic (remember Flash Cubes?!), when I was about ten, and my first 'proper' camera, a Contax 139 with a couple of Zeiss lenses, twenty years later after borrowing a friend's Pentax SLR and getting hooked. I used mainly Kodachrome and Fujichrome in it; it went all over the world with me and was a complete joy - some of my photos from then are still some of my favourites. In the 90s I was seduced by the convenience of digital and my picture-taking declined into snapping with a succession of Canon pocket cameras. Then one day about four years ago I picked up the old Contax again and realised what I had been missing; I very quickly acquired a used 5D2 and some nice L glass and had quite a lot of fun with it. Inevitably though, its weight and size meant that more often than not it was left at home, and I never did bond with the hi-tech electronic side of it. Aargh! - no aperture ring!! By chance I started reading about Leica, of which I had barely heard, and I became fascinated, almost obsessed, and read everything I could find. Eventually the inevitable happened, and I found a lovely used silver M9P at Richard Caplan at a price I could just about manage, though I could hardly believe that I was letting myself go through with it. Six months later I offloaded the Canon gear as I had barely touched it since the Leica arrived (though I did miss the splendid, if brutal, Canon 85mm 1.2 lens, which I later managed to replace with a 75 Summilux - even better!) I did try a 240 for a few weeks, when my M9 sensor got the dreaded lurgy, but thankfully went back to another M9P. It has taught me more in two years than I have learnt from other cameras over decades, because it addresses the basics so simply and because my fingers constantly itch to pick it up and use it. I am also learning so much from this forum and from you all who are so generous with your knowledge, artistry and encouragement, and usually very courteously. Thank you!

Which means we all think in ASA/ISO as we did with film, but are just learning that the idea was kept around but doesn't really actually mean anything, except that it allows us to continue making images that we can chimp, rather than drown everything out in darkness. ISO variations then do two things: keep us from blowing out highlights, and allow us to chimp effectively (focus, dof, composition, etc.), as long as we stay within the range of the CMOS, which is much greater than we think. How many stops is that sensor actually capturing then? What units could I be more efficiently using/thinking in than ISO/fStop/ShutterSpeed? Lumens? So then a whole new way - for me - of looking at capturing light: what combination of aperture and shutter speed will allow the appropriate range of lumens access to the CMOS. One of the Holy Triad of exposure adjustments appears to have been taken from us, but that's short-sighted, because what we're learning is that the CMOS effectively has a much wider range of stops than film: from, let's say, three stops below ISO200 (native sensitivity), to perhaps as many as seven stops above (ISO3200+three stops). So as long as my exposure is within those eleven stops, I should have data to manipulate - RAW files assumed - trusting that the RAW file isn't automatically discarding highs and lows just because the meter said so based on ISO/fStop/ShutterSpeed inputs (but my experience of Christmas Eve, shooting after dark, was that the meter gave up (\"I can't see nothin!\"), while the sensor kept gathering light (\"Oo: pretty!\"). Which is to say, I might help myself through the transition by shooting the M240 like an M4: no internal light-meter, because that just tricks me into old patterns: use the Lumu in my iPhone as a spotmeter dialed up to whatever ISO I like (say... max of 3200 on the M240), choose the aperture/shutterspeed combo I like, leave the M240 set on 200, and bang away.... So: ISO200, any shutter speed and aperture combo that won't blow out highlights and would capture blacks at (theoretical) ISOs up to 3200, and bob's your uncle in post-processing. What we need, really, is the metering revolution, not evolution: kill the ISO inputs, give us a meter that shows what the CMOS is capable of registering and how many stops we're exploiting with our current f/speed combo, retain the chimping capability despite exposure (a sort of temporary auto-gain for the camera display), and post-processing that acknowledges the new methods.

Is it fair to say that you are still experimenting and coming into your own with respect to your optimum workflow and that the jury is still out as to whether ultimately you will use more of the pro-film stocks or stick with the non pros? (James posted as I write this) The difference between \"professional\" and \"consumer\" films is/was mostly about marketing and distribution channels. And by marketing, I don't mean just a sham to kid people - although that plays a small role. Technically, there is very little difference between, say, Fuji Provia 100 and Sensia 100 (as was). I mean, E6 and C-41 are pretty precise processes in which you have to combine specific chemical dye coupler A (film) with developer chemical Z to get cyan. You can't really source a different chemical B instead of A, to make the film \"cheaper\" - or you don't get any dye at all. But - Sensia was sold in large orders to chain stores where it sat on shelves for months, by one part of Fuji's sales force - and Provia is sold by different sales reps, in smaller orders, to a different customer base (pro-oriented stores) that could keep it refrigerated. All films age continuously, reaching a \"peak\" of quality (color accuracy, primarily) some time after it rolls off the coating machine. Consumer films were shipped \"unripe\" direct from the factory, on the assumption that 8-20 weeks sitting on a Walgreens'/Bootes' shelf before purchase would take care of the \"ripening.\" Pro films (in their heyday) were held back by the manufacturer until test rolls showed they had reached that peak, and then refrigerated to minimize any further ages before shooting. (The old Paul Masson/Orson Welles \"We will sell no wine before its time\" idea.) Additionally, each batch of \"pro-packaged\" film was shipped with unique data sheets, that would recommend an exact ISO, and color-correction filter recommendations (based on factory test rolls) - for that specific batch. E.G. Ektachrome 100N - \"This batch - ISO 80, use a 10M CC filter\". (Part of the idea of \"pro-packs\" was that the photographer knew that all 5 or 50 or 250 rolls had come off the same machine sequentially, and had consistent \"inconsistencies\" within that package. You could shoot 20 rolls or 100 sheets of 4x5 of - say - heavy machinery, and know that the \"Caterpillar Yellow\" or \"John Deere Green\" would look identical in all of them**). It is the smaller volumes and additional handling and the expectation of consistency (not quality per se) that make Pro films more expensive. The lines have been blurred even more with the economies required today. Even before the digital onslaught and \"peak film,\" Kodak reorganized all B&W film in 1998 to fall under the management of the \"professional division\" that handled E6 films. B&W as a product line was already too small to rate its own sales force. No practical change to the film itself - they just slapped the word \"Professional\" on all the boxes, not just TXP 320. ____________ ** Those companies are absolutely anal about how their \"colors\" appear in media. My college photo classes were in Illinois, and you could not pass the commercial photo classes unless you could nail those colors perfectly in your pictures. --img--  Thanks, Adan.

FP4+ is an old school cubical type emulsion. Very good results you can have with ID11/D76. With R09/Rodinal you will loose some film speed but you will have crisp negatives with high acutance. However in 35mm it is already pretty grainy. Cubical type films are also more forgiving in a bit wrong exposure. The rest is also a matter of taste. I can only suggest to start with one film (and one developer) and follow the manufacturer instructions so far. The last part and correction in printing will do the Split Grade system for you. However the way to a perfect print is starting with a good exposure and film development. I am already developing my films (and doing wet prints) over 50 years so in principle I can tell you that with every film and a suitable developer you can reach a good result. My favorites are the Fomapan 100-200 films. But also with OrWo Filmotec N74+ or Kodak 5222 Double-X (in principle cine films) you can have perfect prints. And if you like B&W slides you can reach with Rollei Retro 400(S) (an Agfa Gevaert aviation type emulsion) E.I. 125 a perfect result.

As far as grain goes I think it's a question of putting first-things-first when seeing a photograph by another person. What is the photo saying to me when I look at it, so is it a powerful or intriguing picture. Then does the grain help or hinder because the grain, or lack of it, is part of the language you are using to communicate with. So have the choices of film and development and printing and burning and dodging been made well to create a balanced sophisticated image? As far as grain goes I think it's a question of putting first-things-first when showing a photograph to another person. The first thing is I make a choice about the film (and camera) I use because I know in advance it is a vital part of the language I'm interested in using. I chose the film because I knew where I am going and what could be there. And then I try to make an image that has some sort of quality and that hopefully justifies my initial decisions. For example an author doesn't start writing a Mills and Boon style romantic fiction and halfway through turn it into a repair guide for a Ford Cortina. So stick with the plot, stick with the choice of film and what it means to the image. And yes, some potentially good photographs I see on my day out won't work very well because the film is wrong, and this is one of the fundamental points of using film instead of digital.

I am not familiar with the V550 but in case it helps below are a few images scanned on my Coolscan 9000. I should say that I usually edit my images. For my b&w that means running a script with Levels, Curves and Unsharp Mask which evidently affects contrast and grain. But I picked the first three because I didn't process them much at all. The fourth one I did more, in particular with USM so that's perhaps not so representative. I should also say my developing skills aren't the best so that definitely accounts for flaws. The Coolscans have a very sharp light source (though the 9000 less so) so that may not be comparable to the V550. But even on a more mid-range scanner like the V550 the advice to scan at fullest resolution and downsize will have a big positive impact on the appearance of grain. That said, grain can be very good for scanned images since it can, with skillful sharpening, make them appear sharper than they are. There are many ways to sharpen - it's a skill in itself the beginning of which I'm only beginning to understand - and one usually has to perform it both in several steps during editing and at various places of an image. I was once given the general advice to use Amount at 60-100% and the Radius at 0.6-0.8 (with Threshold at 1) to snap up the grain without it looking too artificial. One can also flip the Amount and Radius values, i.e. set a very low (10-12) Amount and a very high Radius (40-80) which will work a bit like adding contrast to the image but in a better way. Anyway there are lots of different ways and it's a matter of picking one or a few that give results which one likes. br Philip --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) An Epson V550. Obviously you think the grain doesn't look right. Please can you post a link to a photo where the grain is properly resolved so I can see the difference. My searches on flickr for 400TX haven't revealed anything different to my own scans so far (as far as I can tell). I do appreciate that Tri-X is not fine grained but it is less coarse than some other popular 400 speed b&w films. From my research of film and developer recipes I am looking forward to trying TMAX with XTOL for a subtle grain and HP5+ with Rodinal for a stronger grain.

I put some water in it to start because the directions say to do a 1 minute water soak first. All water and chems at temp. Since then I've tried doing it at room temp (17c) and it turned out fine also.

As the headline states, I grew up in Germany but live for professional reasons not related to photography since 2005 permanently in the US. I just recently acquired my first Leica camera - the Leica M6 since I always wanted to have a fully mechanic reliable camera including a light meter. I want to do B&W film photography with this camera since I still develop my own film and use my darkroom to make silver gelatin prints both from digital files (using homemade digital negatives) and from film negatives. My style is predominantly landscape and fine art photography combined with B&W converted infrared photography. This said, I am also using digital cameras in parallel to film cameras. For infrared, I am currently using a converted Canon 5D MkII full frame DSLR with 715 nm cutoff filter, for digital landscape/macro/fine art work I am using a Sony A7R - predominantly with Leica and Voigtlander lenses plus adapter. I am not fixed to just one brand regarding photo gear and simply use what I consider best for my needs. I am looking forward to share photos and experience regarding Leica cameras and M mount lenses.
