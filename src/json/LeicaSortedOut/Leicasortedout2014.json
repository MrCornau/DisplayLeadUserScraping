It is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. It is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. That's all. So Jamie - this is the explanation I posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. As adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. You will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (A) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. A) is the focus throw adjustment. If you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. If you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. As you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. By moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you INCREASE the total available focus throw. By moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you DECREASE the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. Right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. From my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) Infinity is very important. Step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today I've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. Don't accept the nonesense I was spouting before about it not mattering. It really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) Now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. I found text to be excellent. Note whether you now have front focus or back focus. If you have front focus (like I did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. So you need to shorten the arm by loosening (A) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise. (If you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) Now, recheck infinity. It will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. But this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) Repeat step 2. You will see that the focus point has altered. Whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general I made positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) When you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. On my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) I did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. When my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range. I suppose that if this were not the case or if your lenses varied then you'd need to get them recalibrated, or maybe accept a compromise setting. Hope that's helpful. Have fun What I don't understand is : 1. How do you loosen the A screw, which is very tightly fit (and has a cruciform shape on M240) without damaging it ? A plain screwdriver won't do : there is no clearance to catch the screw on the M240. 2. What is the \"arm\" you need to adjust : the part linking the screw to the roller or the seemingly twisted piece uprear on your picture ? I don't mind sending it in to Wetzlar, I'm less at ease with sending the camera + 8 lenses.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/118043-m9-coincidence-at-infinity/page/11/?tab=comments#comment-2679442", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "118043-m9-coincidence-at-infinity", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "brett - --img--  i know this is not for everyone and that's not what i'm saying - my aim in posting is to share the work i have done and the successes i have had with my own adjustments. it is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. it is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. that's all. so jamie - this is the explanation i posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. as adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. you will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (a) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. a) is the focus throw adjustment. if you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. if you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. as you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. by moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you increase the total available focus throw. by moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you decrease the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. if you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. if you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. from my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) infinity is very important. step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today i've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. don't accept the nonesense i was spouting before about it not mattering. it really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. i found text to be excellent. note whether you now have front focus or back focus. if you have front focus (like i did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. so you need to shorten the arm by loosening (a) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise.

I tested some solutions, how to integrate your tool in my workflow on a Mac, mainly centred around Adobe Lightroom and would currently have one major wish and a few suggestions regarding smoothing the workflow: 1) Is it possible to modify the droplet file via Apple script, so the resulting DNG files, created by m8raw2dng will be written into the same folder, the original RAW+JPG pairs are residing in? I want to keep the RAW+JPG pairs together in the same folder as the DNGs, I work with in Lightroom. This would allow for future work on them. Of course! Just don't pass the -o parameter. That way the output is not specified and the input folder will be taken as output. Be aware that the M8 DNGs will be modified, too... So make a secure copy while this is in Beta! --img--  2) Is there any possibility for a future m8raw2dng revision, which does not need the accompanying JPG file? I would love to discard the JPG, as I always do when cameras write raw + JPG files. I have absolutely no use for them, except m8raw2dng needs them currently, as I understand. Well that is at the moment not possible. The reason is that the RAW files do not contain exif information. You would be left without Exposure Time, Aperture Value, ISO... But technically it is not a problem. Could you describe your need to discard the JPG further? So when do you delete them, what do you want to keep and why? I think I could come up with a satisfying solution... Why do you want to keep the RAW files but not the JPG after conversion? For future releases? I could modify the RAW files and add exif information for backup purposes maybe. Or strip the jpg of image data and just keep the few bytes of information. Would that be what you want? 3) I suggest, that after a successful batch conversion of several files a small \"result\" is displayed in terminal in the jest of \"83 of 83 files were successfully converted\". This would provide a quick, assuring information after a longer batch conversion for people, who come back to their computer after having a coffee, \u2026 Currently each file conversion is documented within Terminal, so one could seek this assurance by scrolling trough each dialog. Now a big bonus would be if it would be possible, if m8raw2dng would support to post this final result into the OS X notification center and remain there with a time stamp and the result message until manually deleted instead of keeping the Terminal window alive after completed conversion. The first part I have thought of myself already.

I don't have a lens-set based mainly on trying to carry a good spaced out group of focal lengths. Or, which are optically the fastest or most corrected lenses in each focal length. My choices are based on how I want to create a scene through a particular lens, mostly based on the focal lengths I like to work with and \"see\" in. To a lesser degree other particular lens characteristics play a role in why I like a lens. But, mostly I want lenses that allow me to approach a scene with the thought of completely controlling and manipulating the way the viewer is going to see and experience the image. I am more the active \"deliberate moment\" photographer working everything in my control, as apposed to the passive photographer waiting for the decisive moment to happen along through my viewfinder. Everyone has to actively decide how they are going to use every lens they bring along in their own travel kit themselves. These are my travel choices. WATE - I just love to see in the wide 16mm. Not because I want more in the scene as much as I like the near-far perspective the wides create. 21mm seems more normal in comparison to me, but is mostly useful to me when 16 needs cropping. The WATE allows me to see and create the placement of the camera (perspective) and use the zoom from 16-21 to crop the picture, I see in 16mm. Just how I approach the complex ultra-wide view. 28 Summicron - All around way I like to compose and create layered scenes with interest. Also, can be used to exaggerate perspective. f4.0 is normal for me and I tend to go to f16 more than I would f2.0 50 Summilux - Just all around best 50mm lens ever made. Tend to shoot at f4.0 and the transition to OOF is sooo smooth. Will stop down, but I'm not a bokeh fan for near shots as they always tend to just look like everything is out of focus, to me. Mid range shots are nice wide open, though. Great travel night lens with 1.4 available and creating background OOF lights. 90 Macro Elmar - Recognized as having the best optics of the 90mm Leica lenses at near for portraiture, for example. Top quality for distance landscape. Insanely compact and gives macro if you need. I'd never consider carrying the 90 APO or even the other large 90mm lenses for travel. Shot mostly in daylight I don't find a need for f2.0. Best long travel 90mm lens in my opinion. Not used enough by me, though. (I have the 35mm 1.4 FLE and it is a superior image quality choice, but it can be very normal and without drama and interest, for me. Harder to work into interesting perspectives, for me. Bigger and heavier than the excellent 28 Summicron the 35 FLE is too close to the 50mm and 28mm with nothing unique enough to garner a spot in the travel kit. And, I dislike the background bokeh of specular highlights.)

I've been shooting with my M-E for a year and a half and am in the process of making some changes to my lens kit. My primary lens for the past year has been a Mandler design, the 35 Lux pre-ASPH. I bought a mint condition version that I shoot mostly at f2.0. My wife really likes the photographs I make of the family with this lens. I thought I was a 50mm shooter and my first lens I bought was a like mint copy of the 50 Lux pre-ASPH. And I also added another Mandler design, the last version of the 90 Elmarit-M. I can't afford nor will my better half allow me to have all the lenses out there as they all are special in their own as I've become to learn. But this 75 Lux keeps getting my attention. I've not seen one in person, but your experiences here and the photographs I see I know I want one of these in my bag. The downside I have with my 35 Lux pre-ASPH is its 1m min focus distance and flare issues when shooting wide open. Through my research I know the 75 Lux does not focus as close as the 75 Cron but it does focus closer than 1m which I want for close up family portrait type work. Plus the two stop advantage over the 90 Elmarit for some nightclub musician work I like to doing here in town. I'm finding I really really like how the Mandler lenses perform on my camera but I'm thinking of going with a 21mm pre-ASPH for wide, changing my 35 Lux pre-ASPH for the next version 35 Lux ASPH (pre-FLE to get closer focus and less flare wide open) and the 75 Lux. I think the wife would be very pleased with the results from this combo and I could sleep at night not feeling guilty about the investment to be made.

So with the new 23 Summilux, a lens tends to go down in image quality in the close focus range. We could have made the lens much larger and heavier to maintain the performance without varying the aperture. The second option is that we could have limited the close focus distance to 50 or 60cm.

Along with that came a very fine digital camera that does colour as well as my preferred B&W. Here's a selection of images taken with the lens, three of which were obviously taken on a 203FE. I haven't found the lens working as well on the S2, still good, but not as good as on film. Probably due to using just the centre of the lens and a pretty clinical digital sensor. Focus is not as easy to achieve with focus confirmation with the lens wide open as with the auto-focus onan S lens, but that was probably more difficult on the film camera. A bit more concentration and a double take usually resolves that. Another major disadvantage for me is that the angle of view reduces significantly causing me to step back to get the same image content, cos it's a crop camera compared to a 6x6, thereby increasing the DoF, subject contact and making it more difficult to see the detail of the eyelashes in the VF. I have a 75mm S lens, but this has none of the emotion of the 110mm and could never produce say the No 18 shot below.

Although I have never used a flash before, I'm not asking about Flash techniques, comparison with other Flash Units etc.; my problem is understanding what the Flash is actually doing, and what & when I should be altering things on the camera and/or flash. To keep it simple, I have set the SF-58 on my M240 + 50mm Summilux on a tripod in my cellar 'studio', ca. 5m x 5m, white walls & ceiling with recessed LED lighting. Initially I wish to use flash simply in 'TTL' mode to photograph portraits of family/friends/kids etc. before doing anything more interesting. So, the camera is in 'A' mode, ISO set to 200, and I'm standing about 2m from my subject, and I've selected 'f8' on the lens. The viewfinder shows '45' and the flash symbol is shown, and the image is razor-sharp. So far, so good... Now the back of the SF-58 shows 'TTL', 'f4', '<Symbol for 'secondary flash>', 'AZoom', and 'EV +1'. I angle the main flash to 60 degrees and take the shot; the flash discharges, the red light shows on the back to say exposure is fine, and the image looks...Good! But this is the problem - I don't understand what just happened: Did the camera tell the flash the ISO? the Aperture value? The distance to my subject? Did the camera fire the secondary flash based upon it's own calculation to 'fill-in', or did it just do it 'dumbly' as it would every time because I selected it - or do I have to do 'something else' to make it fire?! Has the camera selected '45' because I am using a 50mm lens or is this the default speed for TTL? Should I select the flash-speed of 1/180 instead? So many questions! Having read the maul, I believe that the ISO information is Automatic, as is the focal length information (AZoom = 50...) - but must I set the Aperture on the Flash manually to match my camera for every shot? This is the crux of my problem; the back of the flash says 'f4', but I've selected 'f8' on the lens and the photo turned out OK. Is the flash unit 'advising' me to select 'f4', or do I need to adjust it manually to match my selection on the lens before firing? Also, does the flash 'know' I'm 2m from my subject and is readjusting itself accordingly? To put it bluntly, I don't know how 'clever' this Flash is, and how much input I need to make prior to pressing the shutter. I'm sorry if these questions appear stupid, but I'm really struggling to get my head around all this. I'm sure if I didn't think too hard about it I'd probably get the odd decent result, but I really want to master the 'Art of Flash' eventually. However, until I can comprehend exactly what the Flash is doing and what I need to be doing in response, I fear I'll never get there. The Manual is just not clear enough for me, and reading around the subject a great deal of prior knowledge is assumed. I'd be grateful for any input to explain what's going on.

It is the main element that makes me think of checking of the lenses' RF cam (together with the \"mockup\" of the Leicas' rangefinder roll, which appears in the first picture) : after all, the positioning of glass elements within the barrel (a critical element, to check/adjust, indeed) isn't related, per se, with the focusing distances (they weren't yet times of the floating elements... --img--  ) Please forgive me for repeating the obvious. Not being quite sure of the terminology, I have to make sure that my thoughts properly mesh. --img--  In order to focus you have to move the optical elements of the lens to the proper distance from the image plane. As you write, the distances between the individual bits of glass are fixed; it is the whole assembly of optical elements which has to move forwards and backwards within the barrel. In a correctly adjusted lens the distance between the image plane and the \"central\" plane of the lens is exactly the focal length when the distance is set to infinity. That is, of course, the definition of the focal length. I presume the apparatus shown in this thread is used when inserting a freshly assembled optical system into the barrel. You have to ensure that the optical system is placed at the proper distance from the mount. Hence, you measure two distances: the displacement of the RF arm and the distance of the optical element assembly from the flange. The scale on the lower instrument with the markings as found on the lens barrel make it simple to see whether the scale on the barrel, the coupling mechanism and the RF all agree about the distance selected on the barrel. You need, however, to measure the distance between the \"content\" of the barrel, the optical elements, and the flange; otherwise, you will have a lens with front or back focus. That's what the second instrument in front of the apparatus does. If I have understood the device correctly. You use it, then, thus: You insert the assembly of the optical parts into the barrel, mount it on the apparatus, set the lens to infinity, measure the distance between the optical assembly and the flange using the front instrument, insert some shims or adjust some screws until the distances match; then you adjust the whole lens to a different distance, check on the lower instrument whether the RF arm agrees, then check wether the optical parts are at the proper position for the distance selected on the barrel, adjust again or replace the helicoid or whatever needs to be done.

The misconception that 01af wanted to dispel is that the metaphor about the weakest link applies here \u2013 even when the resolution of one component was higher than that of the other (assuming both could usefully be measured in comparable ways), the total resolution of the system would not be determined by the lower resolution component (the weakest link) alone. This is quite generally true; it applies to lenses and sensors with regard to resolution, just as it applies to memory cards and card readers with regard to throughput et cetera. Improving the strongest link, i.e. the resolution of the component that already \u2018outresolves\u2019 the other (in that its resolution is measurably higher) will still improve resolution on the whole.

Even the statements I make below that sound definite are probably based only on rough understanding, but I hope they can contribute to improving our understanding of these issues. So, please take everything I write with a grain of salt and a smiley face. --img--  ...I would like to know how one can determine whether a given lens outresolves a given sensor and vice versa, or whether the resolution of lens and sensor are comparable. Let me start by saying that I don't think you can do this by reading spec sheets. Here's why: The spec sheets tell us how many sensor elements (sensels) are on an M9, so we can calculate ~145 px/mm, but this does not translate into 72.5 lp/mm except for lines that run either perfectly vertical or horizontal. Let's say, for example, that these are \"perfect\" pixels with a \"perfect\" lens. With horizontal lines at 72.5 lp/mm, pixels running top to bottom alternate between black and white. Now, shift the lines to an inclination of 1%. If the pixel at (1,1) is black and at (1,2) is white, then, with the slight angle, the pixel at (101,1) is white and at (101,2) is black. What happens to the pixels at (50,1) and (50,2)? They're both 50% grey because they're averaging the black and white lines which each cover half of those pixels. This is called moire, which gets worse when you add color filter arrays and is why most digital cameras come with a low-pass filter: at the sensor's finest resolution, with a perfect lens, per-sensel detail is likely to create false data, which is often worse from an imaging standpoint than simple noise. Adding a low-pass filter blurs out those finest details, avoiding false data and enabling lines at angles (including curves) to be resolved about as well as lines that are horizontal or vertical, but limiting the maximum resolution of even a sensor with \"perfect\" sensels. (And most lenses have low enough contrast at the >100 lp/mm of a D800 or NEX-7 to make low-pass filters arguably unnecessary.) Since Leica (along with every other camera manufacturer I'm aware of) doesn't publish the specs of its low-pass system, which would need to include both the cut-off resolution and the slope of the transition, it is impossible to derive maximum resolution from the spec sheet. Similarly, I don't think MTF curves can provide the desired data to determine maximum resolution. The style of chart that is most common today--contrast as a function of distance from axis, charted at specific resolutions--definitely won't. It is impossible to reliably extrapolate performance at 70 or 100 lp/mm from data at 5, 10, 20, and 40 lp/mm. What you want is a graph of contrast as a function of resolution, charted at specific distances from the axis, which I've seen used by Angenieux and Erwin Puts. However, even this style of chart won't tell you what is limiting contrast at a given resolution. For example, coma will affect maximum practical resolution differently than lateral chromatic aberration, and obviously rays at high angles of incidence may be well focused but not accessible to the sensor. MTF charts need to exclude that sort of information in order to present the information that they do. The MTF chart of a nearly perfect lens--showing, say, 80% contrast at 200 lp/mm and 22mm off axis--can tell us that a lens is phenomenal along the plane of focus, but it doesn't tell us whether the lens will work nicely with even a 1 megapixel sensor. So, MTF curves, even though they're valuable sources of information, aren't useful for our theoretical analysis of the \"outresolving\" question. (I think this subject can be analyzed theoretically if one has all the pertinent data. With full design information for the entire imaging chain, an engineer could balance the trade-offs of improving the sensor versus improving the lens without ever going beyond a theoretical model of the camera. This information isn't available to us, though. It isn't a matter of \"theoretical analysis\" being impossible but rather \"our theoretical analysis\" being the thing that won't work.) Thankfully, though, we're photographers and not only armchair analysts. We have actual cameras and actual lenses to work with. So, if the problem at hand is identifying the component of our imaging process that has the strongest deleterious effect on the fine resolution of final output, and if we assume that we're using best practices such as using a tripod and credible processing so that we're limited to analyzing our lenses and our cameras, what can we do? I think it simply comes down to looking at the photos. If the finest details are rendered with high acutance--one or two pixels to transition from bright to dark--then you'd probably see bigger gains going with a higher-megapixel sensor than with a new lens. If it takes thirty pixels to draw a faint spot where there actually was a black bird against a bright cloud, then you'd probably see bigger gains going with a better lens (or lens hood) than a new camera. If it usually takes three to five pixels (before sharpening) to transition from bright white to deep dark, then the optical system is likely well balanced. These are rough numbers off the top of my head, but they indicate how I'd analyze the issue. So, what's a better lens? Yes, you could compare MTF charts of two comparable lenses (e.g., Macro-Elmarit-R 60mm and Summilux-R 50mm) to determine whether one would have better peak resolution than the other. But I think too many things change between types of lenses and eras of design, not to mention different brands, to tell from the spec sheet alone. Test photos are invaluable here. Personally, though, I don't think of resolution as the limiting factor of modern lenses, including good lenses that are over 30 years old. As much as I enjoy exploring the fine details in photos, both my own and from others, I'm more affected by how lenses fail than by how they succeed. That is, I'd sacrifice resolution to avoid harshness, or, in statistical terms, I'll accept lower precision in exchange for higher accuracy. Frankly, this is what I love about my Leica lenses: compared to everything else that I've shot, they have less false color and fewer false shapes. Which is to say, they have well balanced aberrations, which I prefer even over lenses that have higher resolution. I mention all of this because it may tell you that my priorities don't align with yours, so your analysis may take a different shape than what I've discussed here. Whether a lens can (or cannot) or does (or does not) outresolve a sensor, or vice versa, is mostly a question of how the terms are defined. From what I've read, everybody's points have merit but those who disagree are talking at cross-purposes. Once the issue is understood, though, I still don't think the practical answer changes. The bottom line, as far as I'm aware, is that imaging is complicated and there's no analytic shortcut available to us. So, we look at pictures. We make informed guesses to buy what seems like the best gear for our needs. Then, we go out and take photos. From time to time, we might even share what we've learned and what we've captured with our family, friends, and a handful or two of the good folks we've met on the internet.

Close to 500, true - but is the Apo-Telyt 280/4 indeed diffraction-limited? (And \"cutoff\" seems to mean that there is basically no contrast left at this spatial frequency.)

Great question. When I wrote that down I thought I had read somewhere a sentence by Erwin Puts claiming \"almost diffraction limited wide open\" and 1000 lines per mm (lpm) resolution for the APO-R 280/4. Anyway that stuck in my mind. I also have on my computer a pdf file, entitled: Leica R-Lenses by Erwin Puts September 2003 Chapter 3: 180 mm and 280 mm lenses __ LEICA APO-ELMARIT-R 180 mm f/2.8 __ LEICA APO-TELYT-R 280 mm f/4 Among other things he writes, quote: \"Even so, the optical quality of the 280 mm lens is higher. Here we can detect the limit of the MTF graphs when we restrict our- selves to 40 Lp/mm as the highest frequency. There are sound arguments for this limit, but when dealing with very high perfor- mance lenses, the information may not be as we want it to be. The 280 mm f/4 Apo-Telyt-R lens is one of the every few lenses that is truly diffraction-limited. This means that the optical aberrations are so small that the size and shape of the image point is governed solely by physical laws. The absolute limit can be found at 450 Lp/mm. The most amazing feature is the follo- wing: a contrast value of 50% for 50 Lp/mm is the normal limit for high quality 35 mm photography. The 280 mm f/4 Apo-Telyt-R lens delivers a resolution of 150 Lp/mm with 50% contrast. Often the lower limit for usable con- trast is set at 20%. At this value this lens still delivers an out- standing 300 Lp/mm.\" Erwin Puts then discusses film related issues, quote: \"The big question is: how do we obtain this performance on the negative? __ High-resolution photography Let us make it clear from the start. Under practical circumstan- ces, we can achieve a visible and usable resolution of more than 150 Lp/mm on microfilm (Agfa Copex and Kodak Techni- cal Pan). At first sight this may appear to be a bit disappointing. But 150 Lp/mm are 300 separate lines in one millimeter and that means that every single line has a width of 0.003 mm \u2013 an exceedingly small number! Between two black lines there is a single white separation of a mere 0.003 mm in width. The smallest halo caused by the lens or by the grain in the emulsion, will reduce that separation line to a dark gray one, making the difference between black and white disappear. The same holds for the slightest movement of camera or subject. Occasionally you will read about film emulsions that are capa- ble of resolving 700 Lp/mm or more in normal photographic situations (film-lens combination). In this case we have a line width of less than 0.0007 mm and that is minute in the extre- me. But these theoretical claims are not so important because the results have never been seen or documented. The 280 mm f/4 Apo-Telyt-R, which has a theoretical (i.e. com- puted) resolving power of 450 Lp/mm (depending on the wave- length that is being used), can resolve 250 Lp/mm with a con- trast of 50%, of which approximately 150 Lp/mm can actually be recorded on film. The 180 mm f/2.8 Apo-Elmarit-R has values that are a bit lower.\" Here is the url: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fleica-camera.pl%2Fwp-content%2Fdownloads%2FPuts_Column_180-280_mm_Leica_R_Lenses_en.pdf&ei=UXuPVLKHKpLdoATpuoLoBQ&usg=AFQjCNF1IrLGQmhWZhgaxXbgbtCkyzDOyg&bvm=bv.82001339,d.cGU Thanks again for your great question.

Here's why: The spec sheets tell us how many sensor elements (sensels) are on an M9, so we can calculate ~145 px/mm, but this does not translate into 72.5 lp/mm except for lines that run either perfectly vertical or horizontal. Let's say, for example, that these are \"perfect\" pixels with a \"perfect\" lens. With horizontal lines at 72.5 lp/mm, pixels running top to bottom alternate between black and white. Now, shift the lines to an inclination of 1%. If the pixel at (1,1) is black and at (1,2) is white, then, with the slight angle, the pixel at (101,1) is white and at (101,2) is black. What happens to the pixels at (50,1) and (50,2)? They're both 50% grey because they're averaging the black and white lines which each cover half of those pixels. This is called moire, which gets worse when you add color filter arrays and is why most digital cameras come with a low-pass filter: at the sensor's finest resolution, with a perfect lens, per-sensel detail is likely to create false data, which is often worse from an imaging standpoint than simple noise. Adding a low-pass filter blurs out those finest details, avoiding false data and enabling lines at angles (including curves) to be resolved about as well as lines that are horizontal or vertical, but limiting the maximum resolution of even a sensor with \"perfect\" sensels. (And most lenses have low enough contrast at the >100 lp/mm of a D800 or NEX-7 to make low-pass filters arguably unnecessary.) Since Leica (along with every other camera manufacturer I'm aware of) doesn't publish the specs of its low-pass system, which would need to include both the cut-off resolution and the slope of the transition, it is impossible to derive maximum resolution from the spec sheet. Thanks. I thought I would put Statement 1 out there and see how other folks react to that. Here The GetDPI Photography Forums - View Single Post - Sony FE 16-35/f4 is feedback from Sergio Lovisolo of Varese Italy, that also addresses the first point you are making, quote: \"A sensor has a resolution that is strictly related the number of pixels in a defined surface, (pixel density). That resolution can be measured in Line pairs per mm, and in the case of a7r this value is approx. 100 for vertical and horizontal lines. (a little less for oblique) If the lens has a resolution greater than 100, the part exceeding 100 cannot be correctly recorded by the sensor, and creates aliasing, better known by photographer as moir\u00e8. everytime you see aliasing on a digital image, you know that the lens has more resolution than the sensor. When the sensor reaches its limit, it can no more cooperate with the lens to produce a better image. I do this measurement with every new lens I get.\" Similarly, I don't think MTF curves can provide the desired data to determine maximum resolution. The style of chart that is most common today--contrast as a function of distance from axis, charted at specific resolutions--definitely won't. It is impossible to reliably extrapolate performance at 70 or 100 lp/mm from data at 5, 10, 20, and 40 lp/mm. What you want is a graph of contrast as a function of resolution, charted at specific distances from the axis, which I've seen used by Angenieux and Erwin Puts. However, even this style of chart won't tell you what is limiting contrast at a given resolution. For example, coma will affect maximum practical resolution differently than lateral chromatic aberration, and obviously rays at high angles of incidence may be well focused but not accessible to the sensor. MTF charts need to exclude that sort of information in order to present the information that they do. The MTF chart of a nearly perfect lens--showing, say, 80% contrast at 200 lp/mm and 22mm off axis--can tell us that a lens is phenomenal along the plane of focus, but it doesn't tell us whether the lens will work nicely with even a 1 megapixel sensor. So, MTF curves, even though they're valuable sources of information, aren't useful for our theoretical analysis of the \"outresolving\" question. (I think this subject can be analyzed theoretically if one has all the pertinent data. With full design information for the entire imaging chain, an engineer could balance the trade-offs of improving the sensor versus improving the lens without ever going beyond a theoretical model of the camera. This information isn't available to us, though. It isn't a matter of \"theoretical analysis\" being impossible but rather \"our theoretical analysis\" being the thing that won't work.) Thankfully, though, we're photographers and not only armchair analysts. We have actual cameras and actual lenses to work with. So, if the problem at hand is identifying the component of our imaging process that has the strongest deleterious effect on the fine resolution of final output, and if we assume that we're using best practices such as using a tripod and credible processing so that we're limited to analyzing our lenses and our cameras, what can we do? I think it simply comes down to looking at the photos. If the finest details are rendered with high acutance--one or two pixels to transition from bright to dark--then you'd probably see bigger gains going with a higher-megapixel sensor than with a new lens. If it takes thirty pixels to draw a faint spot where there actually was a black bird against a bright cloud, then you'd probably see bigger gains going with a better lens (or lens hood) than a new camera. If it usually takes three to five pixels (before sharpening) to transition from bright white to deep dark, then the optical system is likely well balanced. These are rough numbers off the top of my head, but they indicate how I'd analyze the issue. So, what's a better lens? Yes, you could compare MTF charts of two comparable lenses (e.g., Macro-Elmarit-R 60mm and Summilux-R 50mm) to determine whether one would have better peak resolution than the other. But I think too many things change between types of lenses and eras of design, not to mention different brands, to tell from the spec sheet alone. Test photos are invaluable here. Personally, though, I don't think of resolution as the limiting factor of modern lenses, including good lenses that are over 30 years old. As much as I enjoy exploring the fine details in photos, both my own and from others, I'm more affected by how lenses fail than by how they succeed. That is, I'd sacrifice resolution to avoid harshness, or, in statistical terms, I'll accept lower precision in exchange for higher accuracy. Frankly, this is what I love about my Leica lenses: compared to everything else that I've shot, they have less false color and fewer false shapes. Which is to say, they have well balanced aberrations, which I prefer even over lenses that have higher resolution. I mention all of this because it may tell you that my priorities don't align with yours, so your analysis may take a different shape than what I've discussed here. Whether a lens can (or cannot) or does (or does not) outresolve a sensor, or vice versa, is mostly a question of how the terms are defined. From what I've read, everybody's points have merit but those who disagree are talking at cross-purposes. Once the issue is understood, though, I still don't think the practical answer changes. The bottom line, as far as I'm aware, is that imaging is complicated and there's no analytic shortcut available to us. So, we look at pictures. We make informed guesses to buy what seems like the best gear for our needs. Then, we go out and take photos. From time to time, we might even share what we've learned and what we've captured with our family, friends, and a handful or two of the good folks we've met on the internet. Cheers, Jon Again, I think you try to address an important point, namely how to determine whether the sensor or the lens has higher resolution. Your point looking at images seems to be the way forward.

(and most lenses have low enough contrast at the >100 lp/mm of a d800 or nex-7 to make low-pass filters arguably unnecessary.) since leica (along with every other camera manufacturer i'm aware of) doesn't publish the specs of its low-pass system, which would need to include both the cut-off resolution and the slope of the transition, it is impossible to derive maximum resolution from the spec sheet. thanks. i thought i would put statement 1 out there and see how other folks react to that. here the getdpi photography forums - view single post - sony fe 16-35/f4 is feedback from sergio lovisolo of varese italy, that also addresses the first point you are making, quote: \"a sensor has a resolution that is strictly related the number of pixels in a defined surface, (pixel density). that resolution can be measured in line pairs per mm, and in the case of a7r this value is approx. 100 for vertical and horizontal lines. (a little less for oblique) if the lens has a resolution greater than 100, the part exceeding 100 cannot be correctly recorded by the sensor, and creates aliasing, better known by photographer as moir\u00e8. everytime you see aliasing on a digital image, you know that the lens has more resolution than the sensor. when the sensor reaches its limit, it can no more cooperate with the lens to produce a better image. i do this measurement with every new lens i get.\" similarly, i don't think mtf curves can provide the desired data to determine maximum resolution. the style of chart that is most common today--contrast as a function of distance from axis, charted at specific resolutions--definitely won't. it is impossible to reliably extrapolate performance at 70 or 100 lp/mm from data at 5, 10, 20, and 40 lp/mm. what you want is a graph of contrast as a function of resolution, charted at specific distances from the axis, which i've seen used by angenieux and erwin puts. however, even this style of chart won't tell you what is limiting contrast at a given resolution. for example, coma will affect maximum practical resolution differently than lateral chromatic aberration, and obviously rays at high angles of incidence may be well focused but not accessible to the sensor. mtf charts need to exclude that sort of information in order to present the information that they do. the mtf chart of a nearly perfect lens--showing, say, 80% contrast at 200 lp/mm and 22mm off axis--can tell us that a lens is phenomenal along the plane of focus, but it doesn't tell us whether the lens will work nicely with even a 1 megapixel sensor. so, mtf curves, even though they're valuable sources of information, aren't useful for our theoretical analysis of the \"outresolving\" question.

I didn't expect such a range of replies. First, let me talk about what I've been doing so far. I've been taking mostly street photography and natural model photos. I haven't done any sports photography since I left Colorado back in March (I live in Japan now). I checked out a few digital DSLRs recently. Most recently, I enjoyed playing around with the Nikon D750. I've also looked at a couple mirrorless options again, but still am not very impressed. Part of the reason I have been considering going to a DSLR was for autofocus capability, as well as how it is easier for me to manually focus a lens through the prism when I am working with a fast lens (1.4, 1.2 for example, it is a little harder for me to nail a good focus on the Leica) Unfortunatly, I have to say again that the DSLR camp is not doing it for me, for a couple of reasons. First, it comes to the size. now, I know that the size of FX DSLRs (inclduing the 750) are not THAT much bigger than their older film versions, but there is still a visual difference between the Leica and a modern DSLR. This is too important for me to just drop the Leica. I love the Leica for its shape and its unobtrusiveness Older film Nikons (FE, F3 for example, comes to mind) are not as intrusive because of its slightly smaller size, although the lenses are certainly a bit larger. I can walk into a concert with a film Nikon and not be checked. Same with my Leica, and in fact, it is even easier to walk into a concert (in fact, I'm going to a concert next Wednesday to take some photos). Design and looks aside, the other thing turning me off from DSLRs are simply simplicity. Now, I know I have read all the replies on this thread, and how everyone's interpretation of simplicity varies, so let me go a little deeper. Intuitiveness. Simply put, modern DSLRs are not intuitive. Looking at the top of my Leica, I see the knob for Shutter speed. The lens as Aperture. My only wish is that they included an ISO dial on top as well, but even this flub is intuitive and easy to figure out. Right next to the screen is the ISO button. The first time I saw this, I pressed it, then spun the dial. Nothing happened. Then I decided to try holding down the ISO button, while spinning the dial. Boom. ISO can be changed. Not as intuitive as I would like, but it is enough. I hardly make ISO changes anyway, it's simply set and forget for me depending on the lighting. I just change aperture and shutter speed at that point. And I did this without having to break open the manual. I had quite literally opened the box, charged the battery, put it in, and went out and took photos. Only after I returned home did I delve into the manual to figure out certain things, like how to delete photos in-camera, format the SD card, and such. And, in my opinion, that is how a modern DSLR should be like. Every time I go and check out a DSLR, I fling around dials, and press buttons. With the D750, I was able to figure out how to change shutter and aperture, after a few minutes working with the physical dials, but I had a very hard time just trying to figure out how to take it out of auto-iso even in manual mode. And to me, this means the camera failed the intuitive department. Oh, I have no doubt that I can make a DSLR be as simple as possible to work with, setting custom settings and reading the manual to know how everything works, but it shouldn't be like that. It should be the opposite. I should be able to look at a camera, and say, \"There's ISO, there's shutter, there's aperture. Oh, and there's the dial that has Auto mode, and Manual mode.\" Boom. Done. That's all I need to know to go out and take photos right now. After that, then I should still be able to go into the manual to figure out how to properly make custom programmable settings, and to see how every single feature works. And that's part of the reason why I bought the Leica as my first serious camera. Intuitive. Easy to grasp. Simple. That's one of there reasons why I think those new-fangled Fujifilm mirrorless cameras are doing well. I saw a new one here in Japan that had all those dials I just mentioned, and it was so easy to just pick up and shoot. Granted, however, I know that none of the big name manufacturers are going to make something intuitive, cheaper, and simple. There's not enough \"hard data\". But there never will be unless somebody comes out and actually puts out a camera like that. Build a DSLR that has an optical viewfinder, all the needed controls (ISO, Aperture, Shutter) physically on the body (without a distracting LCD on top, I can get into that more another time) make it full frame, and in a weather-sealed body that is the size of a Nikon F3 or smaller, with WIFI (because instant JPEG transfer to a phone for social media is important, especially wedding photographers), an articulating rear screen, 1/8000 shutter speed, and around 5-6 fps, and I guarantee you that every pro and semi-pro-photographer is going to take a very hard look at that camera and buy it. And if you keep all the bloat out of it, I bet you that the cost can be kept under 1500 dollars. The smart company would add the capability of purchasing \"apps\" or simply upgrading the firmware. Maybe make a higher version with better movie or sport photo capabilities. **throws hands in air** Shit, someone just give me 10 million dollars and I'll design the damn thing myself and market it. I think I feel like Steve Jobs might have felt like when looking at computers and software and saying \"You can do better\". You hear that Canon? Nikon? Leica? You can do better. --img--  **Edit** And to add more fuel to the fire, I'll even buy an aquarium and drop the new camera in it to see it still works afterwards. XD Sorry, I kind of got a little fired up, but I just feel like the manufacturers can do better for the photographer and the consumer in mind. But, the market is ruled by money and graphs.

 -----> hardly !!!  -----> make !!!  iso changes anyway, it's simply set and forget for me depending on the lighting. i just change aperture and shutter speed at that point. and i did this without having to break open the manual. i had quite literally opened the box, charged the battery, put it in, and went out and took photos. only after i returned home did i delve into the manual to figure out certain things, like how to delete photos in-camera, format the sd card, and such. and, in my opinion, that is how a modern dslr should be like. every time i go and check out a dslr, i fling around dials, and press buttons. with the d750, i was able to figure out how to change shutter and aperture, after a few minutes working with the physical dials, but i had a very hard time just trying to figure out how to take it out of auto-iso even in manual mode. and to me, this means the camera failed the intuitive department. oh, i have no doubt that i can make a dslr be as simple as possible to work with, setting custom settings and reading the manual to know how everything works, but it shouldn't be like that. it should be the opposite. i should be able to look at a camera, and say, \"there's iso, there's shutter, there's aperture. oh, and there's the dial that has auto mode, and manual mode.\" boom. done. that's all i need to know to go out and take photos right now. after that, then i should still be able to go into the manual to figure out how to properly make custom programmable settings, and to see how every single feature works. and that's part of the reason why i bought the leica as my first serious camera. intuitive. easy to grasp. simple. that's one of there reasons why i think those new-fangled fujifilm mirrorless cameras are doing well. i saw a new one here in japan that had all those dials i just mentioned, and it was so easy to just pick up and shoot. granted, however, i know that none of the big name manufacturers are going to make something intuitive, cheaper, and simple. there's not enough \"hard data\". but there never will be unless somebody comes out and actually puts out a camera like that. build a dslr that has an optical viewfinder, all the needed controls (iso, aperture, shutter) physically on the body (without a distracting lcd on top, i can get into that more another time) make it full frame, and in a weather-sealed body that is the size of a nikon f3 or smaller, with wifi (because instant jpeg transfer to a phone for social media is important, especially wedding photographers), an articulating rear screen, 1/8000 shutter speed, and around 5-6 fps, and i guarantee you that every pro and semi-pro-photographer is going to take a very hard look at that camera and buy it. and if you keep all the bloat out of it, i bet you that the cost can be kept under 1500 dollars. the smart company would add the capability of purchasing \"apps\" or simply upgrading the firmware. maybe make a higher version with better movie or sport photo capabilities. **throws hands in air** shit, someone just give me 10 million dollars and i'll design the damn thing myself and market it. i think i feel like steve jobs might have felt like when looking at computers and software and saying \"you can do better\". you hear that canon? nikon? leica? you can do better. --img--  **edit** and to add more fuel to the fire, i'll even buy an aquarium and drop the new camera in it to see it still works afterwards. xd sorry, i kind of got a little fired up, but i just feel like the manufacturers can do better for the photographer and the consumer in mind. but, the market is ruled by money and graphs. edited october 30, 2014 by torgian", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 94280, "year": "2014"}, {"autor": "flyalf", "date": "2014-11-10 20:38:00", "content": "So I'm sure this has been hashed around, but why is there not a good DSLR out there that is similar to a Leica in quality and simplicity? ...

As an employee of a manufacturer in an industrial industry, we really strive to get a match with customer needs and product features. However, reverse logistics can either create a negative impact whether a company has a lenient or tightened return policy. Personally, I believe we all wind up paying for the customer that \"shops\" the stores and has no hesitancy to return an expensive item within their own decision process. There are a few studies that show a more trusting return policy helps sales and vice versa: Return Policies Directly Impact Sales Here's an interesting quote/source: A return can be a future sale. Consumers are known to change their minds, and today\u2019s consumers believe that they\u2019re entitled to do so.

Surely buying something, using it for 30 days, then sending it back because you don't like it, seems to have an end disadvantage for someone. Is it the poor retailer, or the next buyer that has to wear the 'damage' of the now used goods?

I acknowledge there is a level of criticism in my post, but there is a genuine interest in how it really works and who really pays for the mistake. --img--  Is this practice contributing to the alleged camera recession? Fair question. Many retailers offer a 'satisfaction guaranteed' return policy - here is a copy from the B&H Photo website \"Our goal is to ensure your complete satisfaction If, for whatever reason, you are dissatisfied with your purchase, you can return it to B&H within 30 days of purchase date subject to conditions below. \" Now, in the case of B&H the equipment must be returned in 'as new' condition. I don't know what arrangements they have with the manufacturer for the return of equipment, but the policy is clearly designed to increase sales and undoubtedly pays off or they wouldn't keep it. For example, over the years I have purchased literally tens of thousands of dollars in equipment from B&H and I do so with a sense of comfort knowing if it isn't quite what I thought it would be I can return it and I have never returned an item under this policy until I returned the XT1. I do make a good faith effort to do my due diligence because I don't think it is right to just buy something with the intention to send it back and I don't need to go to the extra effort of sending it back. In this case, the XT1 was a brand new model so it wasn't available to rent. I did, however, rent an XPro 1 in advance just to get a feel for the files and a couple lenses, but it is a different camera. All I had to go on was preliminary reviews which were all glowing reviews. So, I bought the camera and a lens. I got it, tried it out. Painstakingly compared the files with files from my Nex 6, my M240 and used both native Fuji lenses and my Leica lenses. I took dozens - probably hundreds of shots testing the autofocus tracking which was claimed to be outstanding. It wasn't. The images were nice, but were short of the M240 and not noticeably better than my Nex 6. So, what should one do. Suck it up and say \"I'm disappointed, but oh well... there goes $1,600? \" Or take advantage of the return policy.... if not for which I would not have purchased the camera in the first place. And, now, I will be a happy return customer (I already have been on different equipment) Which is of course why they have the policy. They want people to buy. There is no doubt B&H and Amazon and the others have done their homework and determined such a policy increases net sales of the products. More people are going to buy if they believe: \"hey, if I it's not what I think it will be, at least I can return it\". In this case, I really wanted to keep the camera, but it doesn't perform up to the standards I expected or was led to believe. So, back it goes. I'm happy I didn't spend $1600 on something less than i expected. B&H is happy because they have a good customer who is happy and will be coming back to buy more.

It's a nice bag but not what I needed, however I was intrigued by the removable insert shown in the photos. I called Millican and spoke to a very pleasant person who told me they'd had several requests for the insert and were looking to produce it as a stand-alone product. I made them aware that I was due to go on my travels soon and therefore I was pleasantly surprised when I received a phone call out of the blue the other day to tell me that the product was \"due to be released shortly, but as you're going away soon, would you like to purchase one today?\". The price was \u00a360 which compared to a similar but less functional product from ONA that I'd seen, seems like great value. I wasn't sure what to expect but it arrived this morning and I am certainly impressed. Firstly, there was a hand-written letter in the package thanking me for my purchase, and secondly, the bag itself is instantly identifiable as a high quality product. I believe they're hand-sewn by Millican and the level of craftsmanship is far beyond my expectations at this price-point. The material used is very soft but as you'll see below, it's sturdy enough to take the weight of a Leica M9 (mostly brass) and stand up without deforming. The button closure is real wood with a strong loop to secure it. Basically, this is perfect for me as I have a messenger bag I regularly use and this will just sit inside nicely, keeping my camera and spare lens etc secure. Photos... Here's the insert itself: --img--  (iPhone below for size comparison) --img--  --img--  The insert has a hole for the lens to fit through. I found this to fit a 60mm fuji lens without the hood, and even an 18-55 fuji lens without the hood. The hood for the 60mm will fit in one of the lower sections, but the 18-55 being a petal type, will just rest in the top section over a camera body as you will see below, leaving both lower sections free. I'm sure if you wanted, you could increase the size of the hole to fit a hood as well, but I won't need to. --img--  Enough storage for several memory cards and a battery or two... --img--  --img--  --img--  Some quick combinations I tried: Top section: Fuji X-T1 with 18-55 lens, plus hood resting on top Lower section: Fuji 60mm lens and X-T1 battery grip (this protrudes a little but the case is soft enough to still close securely --img--  X-M1 on the left without a lens, and X-T1 battery grip on the right... --img--  Top section: Leica M9 with 35mm lens Lower section: 50mm Zeiss lens plus 60mm fuji lens on right for demonstration --img--  --img--  Top section: Fuji X-Pro1 in leather half case with 60mm lens Lower section: 60mm lens hood on left and 55-200mm fuji lens on the right... again, this protrudes but the case can still be closed (although it's a little fiddly with this setup but could work if it had to) So, overall this is a very well made, and well thought out case for anyone with a CSC setup. It's perfect for the Fuji X system of course but as demonstrated, it works perfectly well with other cameras from various manufacturers. I personally think \u00a360 is an excellent price due to the quality and also the effort by Millican who are clearly a fantastic company to deal with. The bag is available here: Messenger bags, Canvas bags & Shoulder bags from Millican (it's not appearing on the site right now so you may need to call...

Jim Kasson on his excellent blog spent some time investigating this issue and his summary Leica M240 green shadows with the Sekonic step wedge | The Last Word describes the problem in a nutshell: The M240 exhibits nonlinear response at ISOs 200, 400, and 800, artificially depressing darker tones. The darker the tone, the greater the depression. In my previous noise floor tests, I saw the noise floor to be artificially depressed at these ISOs. and: This is probably the cause of the green shadows, since in most lighting conditions, for most subject matter, the green channel is the strongest. Depressing all the channels nonlinearly leaves the green channel the last one standing, so to speak. Because of the above, the green channel shadow shift is probably more accurately characterized as a shadow shift in the direction of the highest-valued raw channel. From my experience I believe that Jim's analysis is spot on. Now its perfectly possible to adjust an individual image in Lightroom or Photoshop to tune out the green cast reasonably effectively, however because this correction is occurring after the image has been demosaiced (and the non-linear gain error occurs in the mosaic data), you need different adjustments for each image. Inspired by Jim's work I realised that if one could apply gain correction to the mosaic data in the raw file it should be possible to correct all images with one set of adjustments. This means in theory I could simply preprocess any files that were going to be significantly pushed or shadow recovered and not have to make individual colour correction adjustments on each image. Luckily, processing M240 raw files is made a bit easier by the fact that the M240 uses the DNG format and Adobe make a source code DNG library available free in order to encourage adoption of the DNG format. So its possible to write a program that reads a M240 raw file, applies linearisation corrections each channel and then writes an output DNG file ready to load into Lightroom: --img--  Whilst developing the program I also noticed that often in deep shadows the red channel in the raw file was clipped, whilst there was still useful data in the green and blue channels. It struck me that I could make an attempt to recover the lost detail in the clipped channel in much the same way that highlight recovery works to fill in structure from the non-clipped highlights. So I added a nearest neighbour interpolation to recover the lost shadow detail, plus a small amount of normal distribution noise to smooth/mask blotches in the deepest recovered shadows. Does it work? Definitely! Here's a quick couple of examples, corrected image on the right. Underexposing 6 stops means we are running out of adjustments in Lightroom, so with a 5 stop push plus 100% shadows adjustment we get: --img--  And this is even more underexposed (it needed exposure +5, shadows +100% plus a tone curve in Lightroom). A 50% crop from a dark corner: --img--  Yes its very noisy, but the colour cast problem is very effectively dealt with. My intention with real life images is not to have to push them quite this far, but it always good to know that the processing is capable of extracting the maximum from the image. On my Mac mini it only takes 3 seconds to process a M240 raw file, and those examples on my blog only had exposure correction in Lightroom, so it completely removes fiddling with curves to approximate the correction. I'd like to make my little Mac command line program freely available, but would prefer if one or two others could test it first, as I've only had the opportunity to post process files from my own camera so far. Interesting thought: this correction could easily be done in camera, the majority of the work is done by a simple lookup table. --img--  Edited July 2, 2014 by jperkins", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/229863-correcting-the-green-shadows/?tab=comments#comment-2622619", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "229863-correcting-the-green-shadows", "result": true, "Selector": "i could make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " as we know, the m240 exhibits discolouration (usually a green cast) in the shadows when images are push processed more than about 3 stops. jim kasson on his excellent blog spent some time investigating this issue and his summary leica m240 green shadows with the sekonic step wedge | the last word describes the problem in a nutshell: the m240 exhibits nonlinear response at isos 200, 400, and 800, artificially depressing darker tones. the darker the tone, the greater the depression. in my previous noise floor tests, i saw the noise floor to be artificially depressed at these isos. and: this is probably the cause of the green shadows, since in most lighting conditions, for most subject matter, the green channel is the strongest. depressing all the channels nonlinearly leaves the green channel the last one standing, so to speak. because of the above, the green channel shadow shift is probably more accurately characterized as a shadow shift in the direction of the highest-valued raw channel. from my experience i believe that jim's analysis is spot on. now its perfectly possible to adjust an individual image in lightroom or photoshop to tune out the green cast reasonably effectively, however because this correction is occurring after the image has been demosaiced (and the non-linear gain error occurs in the mosaic data), you need different adjustments for each image. inspired by jim's work i realised that if one could apply gain correction to the mosaic data in the raw file it should be possible to correct all images with one set of adjustments. this means in theory i could simply preprocess any files that were going to be significantly pushed or shadow recovered and not have to make individual colour correction adjustments on each image. luckily, processing m240 raw files is made a bit easier by the fact that the m240 uses the dng format and adobe make a source code dng library available free in order to encourage adoption of the dng format. so its possible to write a program that reads a m240 raw file, applies linearisation corrections each channel and then writes an output dng file ready to load into lightroom: --img--  whilst developing the program i also noticed that often in deep shadows the red channel in the raw file was clipped, whilst there was still useful data in the green and blue channels. it struck me that -----> i !!!  -----> could !!!  -----> make !!!  an attempt to recover the lost detail in the clipped channel in much the same way that highlight recovery works to fill in structure from the non-clipped highlights. so i added a nearest neighbour interpolation to recover the lost shadow detail, plus a small amount of normal distribution noise to smooth/mask blotches in the deepest recovered shadows. does it work? definitely! here's a quick couple of examples, corrected image on the right. underexposing 6 stops means we are running out of adjustments in lightroom, so with a 5 stop push plus 100% shadows adjustment we get: --img--  and this is even more underexposed (it needed exposure +5, shadows +100% plus a tone curve in lightroom). a 50% crop from a dark corner: --img--  yes its very noisy, but the colour cast problem is very effectively dealt with. my intention with real life images is not to have to push them quite this far, but it always good to know that the processing is capable of extracting the maximum from the image. on my mac mini it only takes 3 seconds to process a m240 raw file, and those examples on my blog only had exposure correction in lightroom, so it completely removes fiddling with curves to approximate the correction. i'd like to make my little mac command line program freely available, but would prefer if one or two others could test it first, as i've only had the opportunity to post process files from my own camera so far. interesting thought: this correction could easily be done in camera, the majority of the work is done by a simple lookup table. --img--  edited july 2, 2014 by jperkins", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 108658, "year": "2014"}, {"autor": "Guest JonathanP", "date": "2014-07-03 08:06:00", "content": "Ron, I've done all my work so far at ISO 200, but I did do a cursory check on a ISO800 file - saw some improvement but I've not looked properly to see if it needs a different correction table.

Let me introduce ourself and tell a little story about us. Back in the nineties I moved to Berlin ( I really felt in love with the city) and established there my art studio. One year after I met a lovely japanese girl and we felt in love. She was an artist too and soon we started to collaborate in some art projects. We were both passionate about photography. At that time we had a Hasselblad and a Leica m6. We had a lot of fun taking photos together in such an amazing place at those exciting times. We got married and we moved to Japan. We lived with my wife\u00b4s parents. They own a farm in a beautiful place close to the sea. One of the buildings of the farm was empty and we set up there our studio. We spent two wonderful years there making art in a traditional japanese building in contact with really amazing people. Then we moved (again) to France. This time we chose a quiet valley in the Pyrenees. We rented a house to a lovely old lady who was our neighbor. She taught us french cooking and we spent together beautiful nights close to the chimney. Now we live in Madrid in an old house who belonged to a spanish painter. It has a splendid studio with incredible light. The passion about photography is still there. The Hassy too is still there. I love making art but lately I had to spend a lot of time in the studio and I felt I was missing contact with people. So we decided to start a street photo project. Now after working in the studio I go out with my Monochrome and summilux 35 mm. Every time I meet different people and besides the amazing files from the MM I can enjoy conversations and social interaction. Therefore this new activity got me even more hooked on photography.

Over the years I have amassed a fairly large collection of Leica books in several languages. This is for me partly a reference library for some of the articles I write in LHSA's Viewfinder magazine, partly for pleasure reading, and, let's face it, because like many of us here I like to collect things, and books are cheaper than Leicas. My specialty has been books written by the early Leica photographer Dr. Paul Wolff, and I will happily offer to anyone here a PDF of my bibliography on that gentleman. One Leica book I have searched for fruitlessly is the 10th anniversary publication by the German Leica Society (Leica Historica): Geburtstage der Leitz Fotokonstruktionen ab 1927 by Wilhelm Albert. This book is long out of print, but allegedly shows many prototypes and odd Leica models. So if anyone reading this has one to sell, or even to discuss, please let's hear from you.

With the exception of the stuff that needs a bit of organising (like a train trip between Tokyo and Kyoto) we are flexible on the other plans, and also open to suggestions: Our intention is to run the \u2018Challenge\u2019 on May 23rd 2015 in Kyoto (location to be decided, but possibly starting near the train station). As such a trip would be more than just a weekend trip for most people, our thought was to organise some informal events in the preceding week as well. We thought that it would be practical to fly into Tokyo and out of Kyoto (or other airport - as most airlines will allow you to purchase \"open jaw\" tickets at a comparible price with a different arrival and departure airport). This plan allows us to acclimatise to Japan in Tokyo, take in some sights/experiences there and then move onto Kyoto later in the week. Kyoto has been suggested by a number of interested members as a prefered challenge location. Here's roughly what we are considering: Sunday 17th May: Yoyogi Park & Harajuku Monday 18th May: Tokyo Temples Tuesday 19th May: Shinjuku/Ginza camera shopping --img--  Visit to Leica Gallery Wednesday 20th May: Fish market (morning) Thursday 21st May: Train to Kyoto (a 2.5 hour journey, depending on the train chosen) Friday 22nd May: Kyoto Temples (oh, and maybe this too Leica Store Kyoto on Vimeo) Saturday 23rd May: First Leica Asia Challenge (afternoon) I will most likely arrive in Japan earlier than the 17th to visit relatives and Dan is planning to either arrive earlier or depart later.

The Tasting Room is ideal as a meeting point / lunch venue and situated directly opposite Ace Cameras. I suggest we meet at The Tasting Room at 11:30 am on Saturday 19th April 2014. The address is 6 Green Street, Bath, BA1 2JY and their website is TASTING ROOM - wine / caf\u00e9 / bar / brasserie serving modern Mediterranean style dishes. They will be more than happy to accomodate us and reserve a table for us. As we shall be there on a Saturday, they would like to have a good idea of numbers. Please could you let me know as soon as possible if you intend to join us. I shall book the table one month before the meet so let me know by the 18th March please! Ace Cameras would also like to welcome us to their establishment and, also dependant on numbers, said they would contact Leica and see if they too would be interested in laying something on for us. I reckon we should make the most of their hospitality --img--  I asked if they could lay on an S for each of us. Did they laugh or what --img--  The location of these is ideally situated for moving on to the central sites in Bath. Pultney Bridge, The Abbey, The Roman Baths, Queen Square, Bath Rugby Ground, The Circle and the main shops are all within easy walking distance. Bath Spa railway Station is, according to Google Maps, 0.6 miles from Ace Cameras and a very straightforward route. I think we might park in Waitrose's car park, which is just round the corner from Ace Cameras. There is also a much larger car park in Charlotte Street, approx 1/2 mile walk to the dealer. All being well, this chap typifies the sort of welcome we can expect on the day. His only worry was that I might be from the Social, checking up on him --img--  --img--  Ok then, that is the plan and Lynn and I look forward to meeting up with all of you on the day for what promises to be a fun day out!!

A few comments, mainly aimed at those thinking about digitalising their own film: 1. developing film is easy and is all kitchen sink stuff - 20 mins tops for 2 films. I have found B+W quite user-friendly and at beginner level it does not need to be an exact science, providing you follow the general developing instructions. It does give me a lot of satisfaction developing my own film. 2. the Plustek is easier to use than setting up a DSLR on a tripod etc. The image took about 2 mins to scan on the Plustek. I found the DSLR set up a chore, which was the main reason for getting the Plustek. 3. with the DSLR set-up you can treat yourself to a macro lens, which is good fun in its own right. 4. The Plustek was considerably cheaper than my macro lens - it probably cost a third of the lens. 5. The Plustek fits in my carry-on bag; very portable. I look forward to your comments.

I've been meaning to try it for a while but have had too many questions. The weather is finally reaching 23 ish degrees Celsius (as opposed to the 35 last week) making it more environmentally feasible to finally give stand development a try.

(1) If I have a development tank large enough. that can hold over 1 liter of chemicals; can i develop 2 rolls of 35mm film. 7 ml solution and 700 ml of water? 1 hour. inversions every 10 seconds for the first minute. Stand 30 minutes, one slow inversion, stand 30 minutes. (2) Can anyone elaborate more on the temperature control for stand development? Highest and lowest temperatures you've tried? (3) Am I wrong in assuming that one roll of 135 film the equivalent to one roll of 120 film and equivalent to one 4x5 sheet film? (it kind of seemed to work for me while I was souping HC110 and HP5). Does the same rationale apply to stand development? (4) I want to try stand development with sheet film (4x5 sheet film) in a 1 liter Patterson tank and the Mod 45 holders. Because of this, I do need one liter of fluids to ensure the sheet is immersed. At the same time I should only use 3.5 ml of rodinal.

I got into photography as a teenager in the '80s, but never really learnt much about it - except that taking photographs back then put the meanings of shutter speeds, apertures, and ASA/ISO into my head. I picked it up again in 2008 with a Nikon D200, which I later upgraded to D800 and some nice primes. I thought it was a terrific camera and still do. At the beginning of last year, going through some difficult times, I recalled where photography began for me, and feeling that everything in life had become digital / virtual, I responded to an ad offering tuition in black and white film processing and wet print making. I really enjoyed that, and bought a Leica M3 (with a Voigtlander VCII meter), and an M6, and then a Zeiss Ikon ZM. The big spend was on a near-new Leica 35mm Summilux \"FLE\". I found that I loved taking that camera out everywhere and gradually the D800 got less and less use. Eventually in December 2013 I bought the M-240, and sold off all the Nikon kit. This year I have filled out the kit with both old (35mm Cron IV, and 75mm Lux), and new (2.8/15 ZM, 3.4/21 SEM, 2.8/25 ZM, 50mm Lux, 2/85 ZM) lenses. I read both or Erwin Puts books (which I bought as PDF downloads from him), and learned a lot from him, while also looking at a lot of photos made by others (including buying a lot of books showing the works of various photographers - I love Nick Brandt, Jane Brown, Andreas Feininger, Marcel Heijnan, Saul Leiter, Bill Brandt, Don McCuilin, Sammallahti Pentti in particular). I am also a follower of numerous bloggers and writers - Thorsten Overgaard, Ted Forbes, and Ming Thein. I am currently one of Ming's students. I think the essays he posts on his site are amongst the best stuff on photography I've read. I've also found the advanced search function here in the forum archive to be really valuable on so many subjects - as well as the helpful replies I've received from participants here. For all that though I consider myself still very early intermediate. I understand the rudiments of theory now I suppose, but I need to actually get out and photograph more. I continue to shoot some film, but I am making more use of the M-240, which I really enjoy. Hong Kong has turned out to be a great place for photography - both the enthusiasts I've met here (including the numerous specialty Leica traders - though I have bought 4 items from forum classifieds listings), and as a source for a variety of subjects.

I am saving up for my first Leica, I am a college student so I am by no means rich. The two Leica cameras that I have in mind are the M6 and M8. To start off. I have to say I prefer digital only because I don't have any places around me to develop film. At first I was almost certain that the M8 would be the camera for me. However after doing more research I found out that the M8 had problems such as sensor or LCD failure. I can't afford to buy a camera and have it break:(. Which is why I started considering the M6, all that means is having to wait longer for my film to be developed. So what do you guys think?", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/220957-new-user-m8-or-m6/?tab=comments#comment-2519159", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "220957-new-user-m8-or-m6", "result": false, "Selector": "me to develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i have to say i prefer digital only because i don't have any places around me to develop -----> film !!! .", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 115387, "year": "2014"}, {"autor": "adespen", "date": "2014-03-20 12:50:00", "content": "Thorsten Overgaard is coming to Melbourne in April 4-7 to do a workshop.
