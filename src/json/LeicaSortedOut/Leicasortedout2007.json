Most operational features of the GR-D are superior to those on the M8, one being the all-important shutter release. We actually have some suggestions on the current firmware update controversy suggesting that people are getting misexposures because they're pushing the release too quickly and should learn to slow down. Let's not even talk about the inconsistently rough feel of the M8 release. I would also add that the GR-D has none of the software operational bugs of the M8 and that, when Ricoh did make firmware updates, they quickly made the addition of several features requested by photographers. I think I am correct that Leica has not yet implemented a single \"laundry list\" request from this forum.

It is not only the image character, but the handling of the camera that makes the GR-D more like \"a Leica\" than the M8 is. The GR-D is most reminiscent of the IIIF or IIIG and with the VC finders in the hotshoe it has an excellent and accurate image, much better than any of the Leicas. What I would like from the GR-D (which I am limiting to ISO 400 for noise) is an F 2.0 lens, which is, of course, what I am used to from the old Leicas (Tri-X/Summicrons), though this is not a big deal. Mostly I would like a buffer that allows shooting RAW once a second or so. Beyond that, a 35mm-equivalent lens version of the camera would also be nice. Carrying one camera per focal length would be a lot easier than carrying an extra M-8 lens. I wouldn't need anything else. For the moment, I'm banking on Ricoh coming up with a camera that meets these kinds of needs. I'm awaiting Sean's review of the GX-100 but I already know that it has no RAW buffer. JPEGS give me the creeps, though the Ricoh BW JPEGS are surprisingly good, better than I can accomplish converting color JPEGS. Ricoh should use even less compression on them. From my experience, I don't see the advantages of the M8 for medium format work over a DSLR, excepting the weight. And even there, a camera like the Canon Rebel seems a better choice to me--about the same size, much lighter, very refined, much more accurate finder, much more reliable I'd guess. I love the image character of the M8, but are the Canons really incapable of that? Perhaps, but the Nikons? I find them very \"filmic,\" very M8 like. But I don't do this kind of work and really just don't understand the values and why someone would want an M8 for this. I also wonder if Leica really knows what this kind of work is about--the color/IR stuff in the M8 would suggest that they didn't. On the reliability issues that Thomas raises, I don't do paragliding, I walk to restaurants. And I can't say that the M8 has been a paragon of reliability. I've had five M8's and one GR-D and the one GR-D works more reliably than the five M8s put together. And look at it this way: For what I've spent on two M8 bodies and a few lenses, I could buy 30 GR-Ds, which would be a very reliable approach. I also understand that Ricoh service is really responsive and good. (Perhaps the biggest weakness of the M8 at this point is the service organization behind it.) Oh well, enough talk about cameras--they are really irritating. I've never had the camera I used make or break a photograph, though cameras like the M8 can certainly get in the way. Everytime I turn an M8 on, I look at the frame counter to see if it's actually still working. I think the recent forum post about not pushing the shutter release too fast because it abuses the camera really knocked me over the edge.

I don't know the ethical and legal lines between inspection of what you purchased and \"reverse engineering\" (which is usually a right that you only give up when you sign a EULA, and purchasing a Leica doesn't require that), but it would seem fair to look at the card layouts and flex connector lines and make educated guesses about whether the ADC on the M16 can see the output levels on all 6 voltages and determine shutdown when any level is not safe, or can only see the power system input from the battery plus warning signals derived from its third contact, and has to compute a shutdown decision from these. I see the purpose of this kind of discussion as educating us to make reasonable requests for fixes that can actually be done, and suggestions for improvements that respect the amount of engineering work involved. As you said, I doubt that you are exposing things unknown to other German or Asian camera manufacturers. In terms of your 'structure\" diagram obtained from the flattened-out pictures, where do you suppose the 4.5 MB of an .upd file gets copied? It has a rather repetitive structure, so I guess it is intended to be broken down into several parts. It must go into the places that are mentioned in the .xml header lines, but it is too large to be absorbed into the onchip ROMs of the 3-4 smart components identified so far. Is there an identifiable large EPROM on the M16 card? Or elsewhere? I also wonder if the Xilinx that with the Blackfin replaces the ASICs you would find in a Japanese design is reprogrammable from firmware, or only when the 4-bit maintenance interface and perhaps some additional power inputs is being used?

What should be the first lens I buy for it? Thanks so much. Enrique, What you have is indeed a post-WWII Leica IIIc. More specifically, a \u2018sharkskin\u2019 IIIc. All screwmount Leicas used vulcanite for body coverings, which was made from tree sap of some trees in Indonesia if I remember correctly. After the war this was difficult to obtain and some early post-war IIIc\u2019s used what is in today\u2019s Leica circles described as sharkskin, due to its rather rough feel to the touch. The IIIc did not come with factory-installed flash synchronisation, your IIIc was modified by an independent mechanic and is flash synchronised (a rather clean installation too!). Before you buy lenses, have the camera checked out; most Leicas of this vintage, particularly if not used for a long time will need servicing. Shutter curtains might be dry, lubricant might have dried out etc. Once you are sure that the camera is OK, start looking for lenses. If you want to keep the camera historically correct, try to find lenses in the 600,000 to 900,000 serial number range. I would probably start with a 3.5/50mm Elmar standard lens, those can be found relatively cheaply. Or, a 2/50mm Summitar could also be an excellent choice. Here is a listing of serial numbers with a corresponding year of production: http://www.forloren.dk/lbf/leica_lens_serial.htm If historical correctness is not important, you can try the many excellent lenses that were made by Canon during the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s. Those are unfortunately, getting rather expensive due to collector demand. Another choice would be the superbly made and in many respect better than the old Leica lenses, available today from Cosina/Voigtlander. The cheapest alternative with surprisingly good image quality would be Russian lenses made for the old Zorki and FED cameras - eBay is full of them.

Upon purchase the finish of the the camera was, well I would say A- just some very minor rubbings on the black surface, it actually did look hardly used. Technically it didn't function, something with the shutter cloth as well as the overall mechanics. I had it overhauled and now, apparantly, it's in perfect working condition, so instead of keeping it enclosed in it's original packaging which came with it, I will want to use it. The only problem I see is finding a suitable lens. I have no experience what so ever with lenses and am not particularly interested in them anyway, they must serve the purpose of being able to produce a good picture within the bounderies of their technical standards. I use the Anastigmat on my \"0\" with greeat pleasure for B&W shots, but i realize this is a relatively new lens with modern coatings. I also like my 35mm asph. which i mostly use for slides, I see the difference between the Anastigmat and the 35mm and prefer the Anastigmat for \"character\" shots and the 35mm for the normal \"snapshot\" range of images. I would actually like a combination of both with the III Mod.f but I think would limit it to B&W use only, which I develop and print myself. I have read an awfull lot on this subject of LTM lenses and judging b what I'v read buying a Voigtl\u00e4nder would be the way to go .... But I would hate using a voigl\u00e4nder lens on such a beauty of a camera, I would somehow like to maintain the 30-ties image quality/style without to much loss of detail and flare ... What lens would I be looking at searching for ? For top quality images I would use my Hasselblad and tripod, so technical top-quality is not what I'm looking for, I much rather look at \"atmosphere\" after all perfection is sort of boring .... looking forward to your replies ... I also have a 1938 black Leica III, which I've had for many years, and it's in regular use - I have XP2 film in it right now. Of course, these cameras were originally designed to use the 50mm lens and I would not argue with the opinion that the Elmar would be an excellent choice. My solution, however, is to use the 50mm f/2 Summar - the only 'fast' lens that's contemporary with this model of camera. I bought one in basically good condition and shot a few BW films to confirm that it was OK. I then had it cleaned and the front element re-polished, and all the glass-to-air surfaces coated. Some late Summars were in fact coated, so this is not entirely un-original. I can get A3-size BW prints from this lens of excellent quality, and it's quite useable at f/2, if the main subject is fairly central. Of wider lenses that look right on the camera, the 35mm Summaron is a good choice, but of course an accessory viewfinder is required. I use this camera a lot, however, with a modern CV21, as a dedicated wide-angle camera, alongside my M2. The small Voigtlander lenses don't look out of place, in my opinion, on the older Leicas.

Well, here goes. 1. Shoot lots of photographs. With attitude. Sorry, that is just me. Shoot some more. Take a break and have a beer. Shoot some more. Oh yes, then shoot some more. Just when you think you have got your subject covered, shoot a couple of more variations. What the heck, its digital right? And if its film, so what? Film is cheap compared to your camera. 2. From a philosophical standpoint, I view myself as a photographer first, and darkroom or digital technician second, so I make a very conscious effort to put much more time into shooting than in the darkroom or sitting at my computer doing postprocessing. 3. This means that I immediately download my digital photographs onto an external hard drive that is partitioned (so as to optimize its speed). I make new folders for each year, and sub-folders for each month. Just about everything is placed into the month folders. 4. If I shoot a specific project, it gets its own folder with a name that easily identifies it. All of the images then go into that folder. 5. I don't have enough hours in the day to do all the shooting that I want to do, so after the photographs are archived, I just leave them until I need them. I burn all of the folders onto an archival Mitsui DVD-R disc, then duplicate this disc. I keep one disc at home and one at work. This is my archival protocol, the discs at home are the work discs andd the duplicates at work never see a computer and are pristine. 6.

The hack was posted by Eoin and you find the procedure here: http://www.leica-camera-user.com/digital-forum/16559-how-use-aperture-m8-dng-files-4.html?highlight=leica+nikon+aperture#post173078 I tried it and many people did also. It seams to work fine in the most cases. There are some concerns because if you manipulate the imported file in Aperture the results are a bit different from manipulating a file that has been converted to TIFF via Capture One. To be on the safe side it may be a good idea to have a backup of the original DNG files from the M8. So you can use them whenever there is an Aperture-update to M8 which will come TMHO. If you want to I could mail you the manipulated file \"Raw.plist \".
