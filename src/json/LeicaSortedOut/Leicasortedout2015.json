As a matter of fact, I have. And I hereby repeat my request for you to provide us with an example where said \"nuances\" exist, so we can evaluate our eyes' skills and compare them to yours. Many people, including non-photographers, perceive a difference. So do I. But I don't perceive any differences which are actually rooted in sensor technology. I just perceive differences between cameras' outputs\u2014which can be eliminated through appropriate processing. So in the end, there is nothing to be found in images from CCD sensors which cannot be had in images from CMOS sensors just as well. No intrinsic advantage in CCD sensors ... but a lot of intrinsic disadvantages (no live view, poor high-ISO performance, etc.). Some will say, well, the additional effort required for CMOS images to make them look like CCD images is a point in favour of CCD. But in my opinion, that's a foolish point of view because the effort required can be made as small as applying a custom profile, script, or action. Just a mouseclick or two. And I'm not only referring to the final outputs, but also to the behaviour of the files under post processing. At this point, you're losing me. What is \"behaviour of files under post-processing\" supposed to mean? Flexibility? Resilience? Malleableness? Effort required to come up with the desired final result? In all these points, I am seeing the advantages on the CMOS side of things ... or at the very least, no disadvantages. Then again, like you, I hope I haven't stepped on anybody's \"toes\". I'm afraid I stepped on yours. My apologies, I didn't mean to offend you ... much less as I always adored your photographs. Still I disagree with your opinion about the alleged virtues of the CCD sensor technology\u2014and particularly after your open-letter campaign it is important to me to raise my voice in order to make it clear that not everybody agrees with you and your 400 friends. Let's have a little quiz. I show you two pictures (umm, magnified crops from pictures, actually), taken with the very same lens on a Leica M9 and a Leica M (Typ 240), and you tell me which you like better, and why.

If people like what they get from an M9 and want to achieve exactly that look, then why should they have to spend a lot of effort trying to get that out of a supposedly more flexible system. A few years ago, when Kodak came out with their new fine grain low ISO Ektar negative stock, I took a 4x5 photograph of a very colorful scene on both the new Ektar and my favorite E100 slide film, which was about to be discontinued. After a long time of trying to tweak the scan of the negative film in a Photoshop to look like the scan of the slide, I got fairly close, but I still preferred the rendition of the slide film. Now I also thought about the fact that I would never even have this ideal rendition to compare it to if I hadn't shot the slide as well. My conclusion was that I would probably be happy with the rendition of the negative, but I would not switch until I absolutely had to. This is exactly how I feel about the M9.

I learnt to make damn good prints no matter what and, while I had my preferences in emulsion and developer, nobody who views my prints cares. Now, years down the line, I don't either. I can see how it distracted me from the business of taking compelling photographs. Thankfully I had the time back then... I've had a look over your photos and IMHO there is nothing in there that needs a CCD, or one camera nuance over another. This is not an insult, by the way, but recognition that the precise sensor look is not a major part of what you have going on. FWIW, I don't particularly like the look of M240 colour. Does it put me off buying one? Yes, a little (more work and hassle), but do I attribute it to the CMOS issue? No. How could I when I love the colour from my A7 and A7R? Leica made a major leap from CCD to CMOS with the M240 and, had they not done it (and recognised the need to move with the 'high-ISO' times in general), they would probably be in deep trouble and your petition would end up unread (the irony, eh?). I am sure the M240 successor will have the colour more to people's tastes out of the box. Honestly, I don't mind if the files come out of a sausage maker, as long as they look good and behave well under manipulation. Then I'm happy. The M9 sensor provides that, the A7S and Df sensors do that, and film does that. In the digital realm, the M9/M-E/M8 would be my first choices because they do that the best at base ISO.

They have a product which is a very good compromise and gives the added benefit of high ISO and proper Live View for those customers that were demanding it. It's not just the colour of images with CCD but the tonal separation, the colour differentiation, and the dynamics and inter-relationship of these properties through a wide range of adjustment and in all tonal zones.

I always knew that it was going to be a long shot, but I decided it was worth trying when I realized that every single CMOS sensor-based camera I evaluated (and I've owned and used all of the headlining ones) was inferior to the M9/M-E at base ISO levels.

Before updating the firmware myself I was aware that this had happened to some M8's and so I did an on-line search to see what the problem was. It seemed to affect some early M8's but yours is the first time I've read of it happening with an 8.2. The following text is a translation of the first item I read which mentioned the problem as posted in the German section of the forum on the 20th Dec last (apologies in advance to dg2mst - see post #5, above - for google's mashed translation of this, his earlier post!); \"After a successful update an image was recorded on a memory card no more. The settings were reset naturally. I tested it with multiple cards and DNG and JPEG. The maps were doing formatted in the camera and the PC, which made no difference. The red LED has just hingeblinkt permanently on. Interestingly, the camera view previously made pictures to another memory card and easily enlarge.\" Later on he states that returning to the previous firmware sorted out the problem in his case. If it were me I'd persevere in trying to get your camera to 'read' the older version. He, like you, experienced the problems with several different SD cards so the cards don't seem to be the issue. Have you contacted Leica about this? They might be able to sort out the problem over the phone? Just a thought.

Tina Hi Tina, I know that some consider this sacrilgious but Jonathan Slack, whose opinion I respect greatly, has taken some amazing photos with the T zoom lens. For those times when you want to travel light and don't need to print at Billboard sizes, they might come in quite handy. Additionally, in a prior thread on this forum entitled T Lenses on the SL, folks compared the results of taking the same shots a tripod with a T lens and the 24-90 SL lens. On the screen at least the images were almost identical. Thus, the T zoom might be a good light lens for some occasions when the light is good outdoors.

I've been working with the normal to longer end of the FoV range lately and feeling uninspired with wide views. Hmm. I thought for a moment about pulling out the Hasselblad SWC. And then I thought, hmm, I wonder if I set up the SL with the Elmarit-R 19mm, set it to square format, and set the JPEG rendering to contrasty B&W ... I wonder how close that comes? The SWC with Biogon 38mm on 6x6 format nets 92\u00b0 across the diagonal. Calculating for 24x24mm format on the SL, the 19mm nets 84\u00b0 ... a 15mm would run to 97\u00b0, but I don't have one of those or a WATE (16mm would do 93\u00b0). Good enough, 19mm will have to do. So ... I created another User Profile named \"SWC\" and stuffed the Elmarit-R 19mm and the Macro-Elmarit-R 60mm in the bag. Should be an interesting combination to work with. My faux-SWC experiment with the 19mm worked nicely this morning: --img--  Leica SL + Elmarit-R 19mm f/2.8 v1 ISO 400 @ f/8 @ 1/160 ... although I think a 15-16mm lens is needed to accommodate the amount of cropping that lens corrections consume out of the original image FoV. The 19mm becomes an effective 21mm after corrections and doesn't net the SWC's full 92\u00b0 utterly rectilinear diagonal FoV.

I have the X Vario and X 113 and EVFs for each. The one for the X (same as T) is gorgeous and is a state of the art EVF with almost twice the resolution of the older Olympus EVF (or Leica rebrand that I own) EVF for the X Vario. That said, the XV's EVF is far more than adequate and I have no complaints using it. When I switch between cameras there is a second or so of shock as I look at a lower quality image through the 5-year-old technology EVF, but it remains crisp, clear and a pleasure to use. Honestly I wish Leica had adopted the newer Olympus VF4 which is pin compatible with the older VF2. Had that been the case, I would have just kept using my Leica EVF 2 without complaint. So, I recommend you get the EVF for the X Vario and never look back. The EVF, far more than on the X, really transforms the camera into a DSLR replacement, albeit a slow one.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/243735-x-vario-or-d-lux-109/?tab=comments#comment-2799680", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "243735-x-vario-or-d-lux-109", "result": true, "Selector": "[idea, make]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": " Man, what a quandary, what a wonderful life we have, the decision is between a selection of more than suitable choices.

The one for the X (same as T) is gorgeous and is a state of the art EVF with almost twice the resolution of the older Olympus EVF (or Leica rebrand that I own) EVF for the X Vario. That said, the XV's EVF is far more than adequate and I have no complaints using it. When I switch between cameras there is a second or so of shock as I look at a lower quality image through the 5-year-old technology EVF, but it remains crisp, clear and a pleasure to use. Honestly I wish Leica had adopted the newer Olympus VF4 which is pin compatible with the older VF2. Had that been the case, I would have just kept using my Leica EVF 2 without complaint. So, I recommend you get the EVF for the X Vario and never look back. The EVF, far more than on the X, really transforms the camera into a DSLR replacement, albeit a slow one.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13752, "year": "2015"}, {"autor": "robert-gregory", "date": "2015-04-17 13:49:00", "content": "I made the trip into the Kyoto Leica Shop soon after posting this - and yes, I\u2019d still like any help and information from any users of these cameras. With the X-Vario, D-LUX 109, and Leica T w/ M-adapter and my 50mm Summicron I had a fun time. The D-LUX 109 was out on the table when I walked in so its the first camera I picked up. Right away I was familiar with it coming from a D-LUX 4. And in some ways this made it not the camera I\u2019m going to choose. Yes, its very compact, my D-LUX 4 always seemed to be with me for this reason, which is great, and this 109 is a much better camera in image quality and features. It has all the tech specifications I could hope for in a very small package. Why don\u2019t I love this camera? The T was next. I\u2019d handled a T just after they were introduced, but not with the M-adapter as it was not available yet. Along with the Visoflex on top and my 24 LUX and 50 Summicron it was fun to use the manual focus. The T\u2019s big plus is what\u2019s not on front, I can use my M-lenses, but in some ways this goes against this new camera idea of mine. I just want something easy and all-in-one, and the T is a whole other system which I need to get a lens just for auto-focus. And with the Visoflex, M-adapter, T-lens\u2026 the price becomes more than I need. The touch screen may or may not be my preferred way to interact with a camera, not sure if it will be faster or slower, easy or frustrating. Only time actually using will help me answer that question I think. Any T users can help and please let me know what your experience is. As I mentioned and probably goes along with many long time Leica users, when the X-Vario came out and I realised what it was [not], I didn\u2019t give it a second thought and never picked one up to even check out. So today was my first hands on. Size and built quality was very nice. Its very film M-series shape and fit, which is great for my \u2018hands-memory\u2019. I didn\u2019t feel I had to try and find a small place on the body so my fingers didn\u2019t hit something accidentally, except the control dial that has been written about. I didn\u2019t seem to have too much problem with it, but time would tell. I wouldn\u2019t call it a \u2018compact\u2019, but is a nice all-in-one package. I\u2019d heard about focus issues. In the Kyoto Leica Shop the light is very much on the dim side so I walked around and tested the focus. Yes, there were a few obvious misses, but I was surprised how well it did. As for the \u2018slow lens\u2019, I set the camera to both auto and fixed ISOs to see how the camera worked. The lens physical speed limitation is there, and that\u2019s just how it is. I probably wouldn\u2019t be using this camera for moving subjects in low light, but with a Leitz table-top in the bag even very dim light and stationary subjects will be fine. Hay, I\u2019m \u2018old-school\u2019 and the days of an f3.5 lens and ASA400 are still a relevant memory ;-) Can\u2019t say I was very impressed with the finder. The view is just not inspiring/beautiful, give me an optical viewfinder any day. I wouldn\u2019t be using it to manual focus often, but I guess it does the basic for framing. Liked the top dial layout, the manual zoom which I did get confused with the focus ring once, the camera was responsive and in general felt fine. Its not \u2018perfect\u2019, but none of these cameras are. I like the 109\u2019s compact size and it basically does everything I need. Its built quality is OK, it has the Panasonic DNA for sure. The T has the versatility of lenses, very sexy and solid modern feel/look, the Visoflex is actually not bad. Not sure about that touch interface, and the higher buy into price. The XV is solid well made, and the controls feel right and accessible (except maybe that menu dial). The finder is just usable \u2018nothing to write home about\u2019, but you have to have it just to have a finder. Odd to say, maybe because its the oldest of the three, but the XV feels like it has the most potential for improvements, but at the same time feels like the total package is well covered.

After much thought this decision is easier than I thought. In some ways comes down to my other cameras. The D-LUX\u2019s main feature for me is the compact size. Well, I have a very nice compact with the Ricoh GR and if I need something to just throw in the bag for size this will do just fine even though limited to a fixed 28mm and 21mm (with converter lens). The T is a very new modern design. It would be ideal if I was going to get a new systems camera with its features, and auto focus lens (hopefully with some fast primes). But the cost is just more than what I want to spend. The XV has basically everything I need in a complete reasonable size package. It could be better in some ways, but I can live with those short comings and of course there are the many positives. Everything I see and hear is that the image quality is up there. ASP-C / lens. So after passing a couple times while I was making this decision I\u2019m going to keep an eye open for those used Leica certified cameras that are becoming available. BTW, the other reason for the XV is with the image quality so good I\u2019m feeling that its time to sell my M9 and get the Monochrom I\u2019ve been longing for.

It was new, just announced back in 2008 and for the first time I held an all metal camera in my hands. At the time I owned a Pentax KS-5 a film camera with a very nice LCD display. Digital cameras were around but I never liked how the Canon 20D felt or how big and clunky SLR cameras were. So I started saving. I ended up getting an Olympus SLR, a Four Thirds E-510 - the first SLR with Live view. Then when Olympus 4/3 cameras went under I bought a Canon 7D in 2011. All this time, still saving, slowly. The M9 was announced, then came the M9P... all the while, going to University, studying, working part time, studying to be a teacher, growing my hobby into a small business. When the M9P came out, I was still thousands of dollars too short - I owed a University Debt, and got my first job as a teacher. But I made money doing weddings, and was able to pay for a 70-200 f/4 Canon lens, a 24-70 2.8 mark 1, and a set of studio lights... but I still kept saving, $10 one week, $50 another week... Then in 2014, after 6 months of an almost nightmare order with Foto Riesel (where I almost never got my money back at all!) I ordered the new Leica M and it arrived in January 20, 2014, thanks to The Camera Store in Lismore. By then, I had already bought the strap, the Billingham bag, the 50mm Summicron Chrome lens, the cards, the accessories, the Olympus EVF a year ago back in 2013, knowing I only needed one more year to get the M. So when it arrived, I literally sorted out all the accessories, and put in my closet and waited for Australia day (26th) and planned my day with my new camera. I read the instructions, I customised the camera, I checked every inch of the chrome body and menus. I dared not take a picture. Since being a teacher, I was asked to help shoot the Australia Day celebrations. It was the first time I was shooting my very own Leica and I wanted to see how much 15 years of shooting film and digital taught me about photography. Apparently, with this new camera, first time using manual focus... I had learnt nothing. The camera gave me no reward. It punished my efforts and I quickly learnt that I was a Teacher, a Business man, but not a photographer... Until THIS shot. It isn't great, but of the day it was the only one I was proud of. It spoke to me and I knew that I learnt something, something no other kind of camera taught me. --img--  What I learned was that it isn't about how amazing the image is, it is about the story that evokes. This is, to me, the first time I ever shot an image that was not just a pretty photo - it was a story... It wasn't a snapshot, it reminded me of the event, why I took it and how it came to be. It was also the first time someone wanted a copy of it. You see, before people paid for Weddings, but no one really asked me for copies other than the client. No one really cared. This is the first ever picture someone asked me and nearly begged me to keep the print I made. There was something about the experience of shooting a Leica gave me - it allowed me to begin looking at my work as art, and not as images to sell... Now, parents come up to me during Sport, Swimming, Athletics and Cross country carnivals at the school, desperate to get copies of their kids photos... but they always add \"because they always look so different.\" No one ever said that to me before... Now I shoot my Canon, Leica, Olympus and my film the way I shoot my Leica; like art, like a story... and every time I do, I get the comment \"because they always look so different.\" Leica \u2014 Poet Productions", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/242491-your-first-leica-tell-your-story/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-2790807", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "242491-your-first-leica-tell-your-story", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " --img--  7 years before 2014 i held a leica m8 for the first time ever. it was new, just announced back in 2008 and for the first time i held an all metal camera in my hands. at the time i owned a pentax ks-5 a film camera with a very nice lcd display. digital cameras were around but i never liked how the canon 20d felt or how big and clunky slr cameras were. so i started saving. i ended up getting an olympus slr, a four thirds e-510 - the first slr with live view. then when olympus 4/3 cameras went under i bought a canon 7d in 2011. all this time, still saving, slowly. the m9 was announced, then came the m9p... all the while, going to university, studying, working part time, studying to be a teacher, growing my hobby into a small business. when the m9p came out, i was still thousands of dollars too short - i owed a university debt, and got my first job as a teacher. but -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  money doing weddings, and was able to pay for a 70-200 f/4 canon lens, a 24-70 2.8 mark 1, and a set of studio lights... but i still kept saving, $10 one week, $50 another week... then in 2014, after 6 months of an almost nightmare order with foto riesel (where i almost never got my money back at all!) i ordered the new leica m and it arrived in january 20, 2014, thanks to the camera store in lismore. by then, i had already bought the strap, the billingham bag, the 50mm summicron chrome lens, the cards, the accessories, the olympus evf a year ago back in 2013, knowing i only needed one more year to get the m. so when it arrived, i literally sorted out all the accessories, and put in my closet and waited for australia day (26th) and planned my day with my new camera. i read the instructions, i customised the camera, i checked every inch of the chrome body and menus. i dared not take a picture. since being a teacher, i was asked to help shoot the australia day celebrations. it was the first time i was shooting my very own leica and i wanted to see how much 15 years of shooting film and digital taught me about photography. apparently, with this new camera, first time using manual focus... i had learnt nothing. the camera gave me no reward. it punished my efforts and i quickly learnt that i was a teacher, a business man, but not a photographer... until this shot. it isn't great, but of the day it was the only one i was proud of. it spoke to me and i knew that i learnt something, something no other kind of camera taught me. --img--  what i learned was that it isn't about how amazing the image is, it is about the story that evokes. this is, to me, the first time i ever shot an image that was not just a pretty photo - it was a story... it wasn't a snapshot, it reminded me of the event, why i took it and how it came to be. it was also the first time someone wanted a copy of it. you see, before people paid for weddings, but no one really asked me for copies other than the client. no one really cared. this is the first ever picture someone asked me and nearly begged me to keep the print i made. there was something about the experience of shooting a leica gave me - it allowed me to begin looking at my work as art, and not as images to sell... now, parents come up to me during sport, swimming, athletics and cross country carnivals at the school, desperate to get copies of their kids photos... but they always add \"because they always look so different.\" no one ever said that to me before... now i shoot my canon, leica, olympus and my film the way i shoot my leica; like art, like a story... and every time i do, i get the comment \"because they always look so different.\" leica \u2014 poet productions", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 82136, "year": "2015"}, {"autor": "DLS", "date": "2015-01-01 02:12:00", "content": "i was more interested in the basic idea of, if one took pictures with a 5d3 or an a7s or a m leica, and one put the images into lightroom and did processing, is there really going to be that big of a difference for a hobbyist.

I invite you to an open discussion about this based on my own experience (a little long text maybe). As many others, I contacted Leica due to some suspicious looking rows of dots on my pictures taken at low apertures. Leica Customer care looked at the samples I sent them and told me that I had to send my camera (M9P) to them to have it checked. Here is my first experience with Leica Customer Care described step wise. It is the service experience that I would like to discuss and not the specific technical problem: > I spent 150 Euro on shipping and insurance to have the camera sent to Leica. I had to make them confirm that they had received the camera. They didn\u2019t do that automatically. > After a short while I got a message from Leica that the sensor was not defective but they would clean the sensor and adjust the rangefinder etc. I was happy with that, and said thank you. > After some weeks of waiting I contacted Leica to hear when they would send the camera back to me. I was told by a technician that I hadn\u2019t communicated with before that there was a lead time of an additional 2 \u00bd months to have the camera cleaned. At that time they had already had the camera for more than a month. > I contacted Leica and told them to send the camera back to me un-cleaned since I had to use it for a field trip. I was the contacted by the first person that I had communicated with and he told me that they could have it cleaned and send back within a week. I was happy with that, and said thank you. > I got my camera back within the week as promised. However, as I went to check it I was really disappointed. The sensor was very dirty and hair-like strands that were not there before showed very clearly on the pictures even at F4. In fact the sensor was much worse than before and the dots that were the reason for sending the camera to Leica were indeed still visible. Along with the camera Leica had sent a certificate stating that the sensor had been cleaned and the camera cap was \u201csealed off\u201d with the orange sticker. I personally do not believe that the sensor had been cleaned. > I contacted Leica again and told them in a friendly way that I did not see the problem solved. They returned to me and apologized and suggested that they had my camera back again. I told Leica that I was a bit reluctant to just send the camera back without knowing what would be done to it, and how long time it would take. They told me to send some DNGs that showed the problem, and they would find a swift solution \u2013 which I did. > After a couple of days I got a mail by accident from Leica. It was internal communication between my contact and a technician. In the mail I was characterized as being very \u201cunzufrieden\u201d which I actually don\u2019t think was quite right. I had only pointed out the problems as described in an objective way. Internal mails ending up at the customer should really not happen. This is a big mistake in my eyes. > After some additional waiting time I contacted Leica to hear their conclusions, and after some more time I got the message that they needed to have the camera back to overhaul the sensor and evaluate if it needed to be changed. That was actually what they should have done when they got the camera in the first place, and they had already stated that the sensor was OK and cleaned anyway. > I contacted Leica and told them that I could not send in the camera right now because I needed it for a field trip, so I would dry clean the sensor myself to remove the dust, and then send in the camera at a later stage for the other problems. I asked if they could provide me with a device and a method for blowing the dust off. > After some more time I got a mail from a Danish agent that had not been in contact before.

i invite you to an open discussion about this based on my own experience (a little long text maybe). as many others, i contacted leica due to some suspicious looking rows of dots on my pictures taken at low apertures. leica customer care looked at the samples i sent them and told me that i had to send my camera (m9p) to them to have it checked. here is my first experience with leica customer care described step wise. it is the service experience that i would like to discuss and not the specific technical problem: > i spent 150 euro on shipping and insurance to have the camera sent to leica. -----> i !!!  -----> had !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  them confirm that they -----> had !!!  received the camera. they didn\u2019t do that automatically. > after a short while i got a message from leica that the sensor was not defective but they would clean the sensor and adjust the rangefinder etc. i was happy with that, and said thank you. > after some weeks of waiting i contacted leica to hear when they would send the camera back to me. i was told by a technician that i hadn\u2019t communicated with before that there was a lead time of an additional 2 \u00bd months to have the camera cleaned. at that time they had already had the camera for more than a month. > i contacted leica and told them to send the camera back to me un-cleaned since i had to use it for a field trip. i was the contacted by the first person that i had communicated with and he told me that they could have it cleaned and send back within a week. i was happy with that, and said thank you. > i got my camera back within the week as promised. however, as i went to check it i was really disappointed. the sensor was very dirty and hair-like strands that were not there before showed very clearly on the pictures even at f4. in fact the sensor was much worse than before and the dots that were the reason for sending the camera to leica were indeed still visible. along with the camera leica had sent a certificate stating that the sensor had been cleaned and the camera cap was \u201csealed off\u201d with the orange sticker. i personally do not believe that the sensor had been cleaned. > i contacted leica again and told them in a friendly way that i did not see the problem solved. they returned to me and apologized and suggested that they had my camera back again. i told leica that i was a bit reluctant to just send the camera back without knowing what would be done to it, and how long time it would take. they told me to send some dngs that showed the problem, and they would find a swift solution \u2013 which i did. > after a couple of days i got a mail by accident from leica. it was internal communication between my contact and a technician. in the mail i was characterized as being very \u201cunzufrieden\u201d which i actually don\u2019t think was quite right. i had only pointed out the problems as described in an objective way. internal mails ending up at the customer should really not happen. this is a big mistake in my eyes. > after some additional waiting time i contacted leica to hear their conclusions, and after some more time i got the message that they needed to have the camera back to overhaul the sensor and evaluate if it needed to be changed. that was actually what they should have done when they got the camera in the first place, and they had already stated that the sensor was ok and cleaned anyway. > i contacted leica and told them that i could not send in the camera right now because i needed it for a field trip, so i would dry clean the sensor myself to remove the dust, and then send in the camera at a later stage for the other problems. i asked if they could provide me with a device and a method for blowing the dust off. > after some more time i got a mail from a danish agent that had not been in contact before. they told me that they heard i had problems with dust on the sensor and suggested that i contacted a certain dealer in denmark who they know is a nikon/canon expert??! > i will now search this forum and find a method to dry clean my sensor myself, and subsequently decide further actions\u2026i need to go shooting rather than writing. i have 15 years of experience with technical service, and to me this is a very inconsistent performance by leica \u2013 both in terms of communication and actions. so, my question: is there any learning for leica here \u2013 and could we give them some constructive feedback and ideas for improvement?

It doesn't take a much to change the perceived pitch in electronics... It's a combination of the fundamental and then how the harmonics are reproduced. If those harmonics are changed in level then you can change the perceived pitch upwards slightly. Obviously this varies depending on the frequency and therefore the changes are 'uneven' for want of a better word. In an acoustic musical instrument these changes don't happen in quite the same way, but each instrument does have its own 'distortion' which is why all pianos sound different in terms of timbre, made up of the fundamental and then the way that sound is made up and is affected by pretty much everything else, such as the materials it is made from and so on. Two guitars playing the same note, WILL sound different. So will two violins. Where does that difference come from and why does a middle C played on a piano sound different from that same note playing on a guitar? Because each instrument has its own sound and character... The fundamental is still the same, but the rest of the note is made up with a myriad of other frequencies all based around that fundamental. Thats timbre. Not the same thing as I am talking about, but it has the same root. At least in an instrument it is relatively stable although you can change the perceived pitch in an instrument if it's resonant frequency is at at point where it impacts on the perceived pitch of the closest note (or harmonics of that note). In a HiFi system, that happens all the time... although not actually resonant frequencies very often, just its ability to respond to very fast leading edges of signal. And those signals are very complex. Look at a piano note on an oscilloscope. It's not a sine wave... which is what it would be if it was a pure 'note', it's made up of a massive number of varying frequencies and a massive number of varying amplitudes, each of which has to be reproduced by the system with absolute accuracy across the entirety. And that's before you have taken into account the effect of the microphone and the oscilloscope on the signal in the first place. To be honest, it's a miracle any HiFi system works given the complexity of the signal! As as far as decent quality systems is concerned, most of the time, if you get the fundamentals right and aim for accuracy rather than 'character' you end up with something that approximates music... enough at least to fool you into similar emotional responses as you would listening to that same music in real life... But no HiFi REALLY plays music to the degree that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. A lot of people say to me that they couldn't tell the difference from two competing HiFi systems or HiFi components. To be honest, if you can tell the difference between a real instrument and a recording of one, then that's perfectly good enough in terms of hearing ability. You should then not 'compare sounds' as they will invariably be different. And if you then take that same sound and play it in a different room, then the acoustics of that room will have a bearing on that 'sound'. However, if a great pianist plays a Steinway in one room, moving to a different acoustic will change the 'sound', but it won't be a less good musician and you will still be able to respond to it naturally as your brain very quickly compensates for the change unless it is truly dreadful. But either way, the musician is still as good, as is the piano. A lesser piano or musician has a LOT more to do to hold your attention. I would argue it/he/she simply wouldn't be able to. Because we are programmed to understand music naturally. Even if you had never heard it. Weird, but also true. And it can be very complex such as a different scale, different rules, even atonic music. Why? Because it is a pattern and the brain responds to pattern - it spends its life looking for pattern. That's why even the most free form of music can be appreciated and responded to, whereas someone just banging out random notes gets old very quickly! What people do at the highest level is to compare what they hear to how they respond to that same music if it were 'live' by literally pitching the notes they hear in their head simultaneously as the music is being played and then listen to the second component and do the same thing. You are comparing your own internal reference to what you are hearing and constantly asking yourself 'can I follow that music, actively and is it easy and natural to do so... can I make an educated guess at where the next note will be (pattern recognition)' And then do the same with the alternative. If if you respond to one naturally and easily, and the other one less so, then you will know which is better. If you can't tell any difference, or there is a difference in sound, but it doesn't make it actually easier to follow, then buy the cheaper option! I spent my life lecturing about this, from studios to universities and its actually a really interesting subject... but not particularly loved by the audiophiles of the world as they prefer to think of HiFi as a matter of taste and choice... The reality is, no HiFi plays music like real instruments, the moment you put a microphone in front of any instrument you change the sound and therefore it's accuracy which then leads to it actually getting in the way of how our brains interpret the music itself. A good HiFi that actually plays music fundamentally better than a cheap system is a rare thing indeed... and is very expensive. I have heard systems costing well over three or four hundred thousand dollars/pounds and they all sound different. If if they are actually trying to play accurately and reproduce recorded music accurately, wouldn't the very best all sound very similar? The reality is, a system that allows you to listen to music of choice and introduce you to new music and allow you to respond to it naturally is a very rare thing indeed. It's. Or just about raw data, it's also about not messi g up the data you have. The very best systems mess it up the least. That's about as far as you can go.

The higher magnification finders give your eye a better view to judge the alignment of the dual rangefinder images. The downside to the higher magnification is that they can't frame the view of wider lenses, forcing you to add accessory viewfinders for framing (or make a WAG as to the edges of the picture). The original M3 only framed for 50mm and longer lenses (0.9 magnification). As more and more photographers began to use a 35mm extensively, Leica added the \"wide-angle\" M2, with a lower-magnification finder that could show a 35mm frame in the camera (0.72 magnification) - but no framelines for 135 lenses, as a hint that long lenses were not its forte. The 1968 M4 collapsed the M2 and M3 into one camera with a .72x finder that included 4 frames - 35, 50, 90, 135. That became the standard for all subsequent M cameras for 40 years (~1959-1999). In 1981, Leica changed the framelines mechanism (but not the magnification) to squeeze in a set of lines for 28mm lenses (also adding lines for the 75mm focal length, but that is not germain to the finder magnification). Personally, I think 28 framelines in a .72x viewfinder originally designed for the 35mm field of view are overoptimistic - they only show about 90% of what will be in the picture, and are hard to see in one glance for some of us, and don't present the quote-perspective-unquote effects a 28 creates, as well as external finders with .50x (or lower) magnfication. But to each his own taste. In the mid-1990's, Leica introduced the .85x higher-mag finder option as an approximate re-creation of the better-focusing M3 finder, and in 2000, with the intro of the 28mm Summicron, they added the .58x option, (again with the 135mm lines deleted as \"not a good idea\") as a better way to view 28mm shots without the need for an external add-on finder. (At the time, there were rumors that Leica was taking the route followed later by Voigtlander, and producing a \"really-wide\" built-in finder that could frame 24 and 21mm views, and up to 50mm - but that was not to be). Anyway - as to your needs. I would say with a 90 that only opens up to f/4, and is used only \"occasionally\" - you probably don't need the .85x finder. Your 15mm requires a separate viewfinder regardless. As a mid-range lens, your 50 will work pretty well with any finder. Which leaves your 28mm as the \"joker\" in the deck. If you use the 28 a lot, I think you will find the finder designed around the 28 framelines (rather than vice-versa) - the 0.58x - to be your best choice. As to non-Leica film bodies with an M-mount: The Konica Hexar-RF was a motor-incorporated AE/manual camera from about the turn of the millennium, with a .60x finder. https://www.cameraquest.com/konicam.htm There is some debate about focusing precision with M lenses, especially longer ones, but I used one for several years alongside Leica bodies, and it was a nice \"automated\" companion for wide-angle use.

I recently purchased a focomat v35 for a pretty good deal. It came with a 40mm focotar lens, colour and multigrade heads, as well as a standard lens carrier ($500). The autofocus seemed a tiny bit off when I tested it but the cams seemed to move properly, nothing seemed to indicate the screws in blue paint were adjusted and the arm moves freely and is secured solidly with the knob. I sucessfully made a few 8x10 prints by manually focusing the lens but then was frustrated that the AF did not work so I tried to adjust the lens mount and ended up unscrewing the lens mount too far to the point where the autofocus click stop no longer engaged and a small ball bearing pinged down onto my easel. The unit no longer focuses properly no matter how far I move the lens up or down on the stage. I've been searching for this enlarger for years and will happily make prints for the rest of my life if the enlarger can get repaired. I do not even care about autofocus at this point. Has anyone had their focomat v35 repaired? Should I expect an exhorbitant repair bill? Leica seems pretty uninteresed in repairing the unit when I send them emails asking for a return shipping quote or specifics about whether I need to pack the enlarger base as well.

There's a digital thermometer probe hanging inside with the digital face stuck to the outside of the cooler. The heater's minimum temp setting is 20 degrees, I leave it at that. The cooler's quite deep, so I've made a kind of shelf that sits inside the cooler, the jugs sit on the shelf up higher - under the shelf stuck to the bottom of the cooler is the heater & pump. The way I go about the business is: 1/ I first place a few 3000ml jugs of water on the coffee table in the warm living room, to be used later for washing 2/ Mix up the chemicals and put them in the cooler 3/ Close the cooler lid, turn the heater & pump on, then go away and do something else (film tank loading, food shopping, toilet newspaper reading) It will all be 20 degrees in about an hour give or take, ready to go! The cooler water will heat up just before the chemicals do (the contents of the jugs aren't being constantly circulated like the cooler water, if you see what I mean), but the chemicals will not be far behind - every so often I'll stick my head in the room and see what the digital thermometer says. Once the cooler reaches 20 degrees I then start paying closer attention to the chems inside. The cooler lid has a separate little trap door, I make sure to place the developer jug right under it with another thermometer in it. I'll take a peek in the trap door now & then, give them a little stir, doesn't take long for everything to reach 20. Because the cooler is good at what it does, you could turn off the heater/pump and it will hold 20 for quite a while - though I just leave it running as long as I'm there doing stuff, considering the lid is often being opened/closed. Because the heater/pump are designed to be constantly running, you could mix up chems & turn heater on hours & hours before use, go out and shoot for the day, get home later, load up straight away & develop, your film will be hanging in the dryer before dinner time! When not in use the cooler sits in it's bench-top corner, it has the dish drying rack put on top of it (after all it is my kitchen that doubles as a darkroom, easily convertible from one to the other... anyway, I'm single & no master chef). The same water will stay in it until it quite obviously needs to be changed (ie. it smells), thereby saving water. With this convenience, combined with the brilliant 'set & forget' Heiland TAS developer, I try to develop a couple of tanks worth of film in a sitting, provided I've shot that much - in any case I CAN do so. In the cooler will fit 5 x 1500ml jugs in it (enough for a 5-reel Paterson tank, but more often than not I'll use 3-reel tanks), commonly: pre-wet, dev (high capacity, like say T-max), stop, fix, wetting agent (distilled water). If using a one-shot developer (say Rodinal) I'll replace the wetting bath with plain water, it will be ready at 20 degrees for the next tank, just add developer... the wetting agent can sit out in the warm living room with the washing water. In the past I've always found film developing to be a major pain in terms of reliably maintaining chemical temperature & hating to stand there like a moron watching the clock to agitate. It inhibited actual shooting, because the dread of later having to develop the film played on my mind. And I'm certainly not going to pay anyone else to do it for me! Then digital came along on the scene at some point there in between... digital never turned me on. In now moving back to the tactile tangibility of B&W film (and with digital I was only ever always trying to make it LOOK like film anyway, duuuh!) my aim was to overcome these obstacles to shooting film.

The previous versions used a single correction algorithm that was optimised for ISO200 but was not very effective for higher ISOs. I always felt it should be possible to get better performance particularly around the mid ISOs 400-800. So I set about converting the application to use individual look-up tables for each ISO. That was the easy part, but how do you build all the correction curves? Faced with the daunting task of hand crafting corrections for ISO400 to 3200, I decided to try and measure the response roll-off, but how to do this without specialist test equipment? After mulling over several ideas, I realised that if I could make the assumption that for 'normal' exposures the camera response could be considered linear (there's not been any evidence found of rogue colour casts at higher pixel values) then I could compare the response of the camera at each ISO for a normally exposed image and one that was deliberately underexposed by 5 to 6 stops. I used a 20step Q14 greyscale chart: --img--  and a B&W 6stop ND filter. Starting at ISO200 I setup the camera on manual exposure and took a correctly exposed image, then repeated the same exposure with the 6stop filter attached. I then stopped down the aperture and increased the ISO by one stop and took another pair of images. Using the profile edition of RawDigger its possible to extract the average RGB pixel values from each of the greyscale steps and import into Excel. This allowed me to compare the relative RGB values for each step with and without the ND filter. Plotting these differences shows how the M240 response varies for each Bayer filter colour against level and ISO. Here are the curves for the Green channel: --img--  There's a few interesting things that come out of this: the plugin will benefit from calibration curves for each ISO. something really different happens for ISO1600 and 3200 (which isn't a surprise given the findings Jim Kasson made). I suspect we may find improvements at 1600 and 3200 of limited value; the effect of noise on the lowest values is clear from the wobbliness of the curve. I could repeat the measurements and average out but I suspect we are really hitting the useful noise floor at these levels. optimisation at ISO 400 and 800 should be worthwhile due to the nice shape of the gain curve. this has all been done on one sample of the M240. However if the cause of the response (especially for ISO 800 and below) is software roll-off then it should apply to other M240 cameras. I have now released a new version (1.4) of my Lightroom plugin to support these per-channel calibration curves. This has indeed resulted in significantly better performance (particularly at non base ISOs) as follows: ISO 200: slight improvement (previous versions had a tendency to slightly boost overall image luminosity which is now fixed) ISO 400: worthwhile improvement ISO 800: significant improvements compared to previous versions ISO 1600 and 3200: its difficult to get any dramatic improvements here as the camera has a different response for 1600 and above and at low pixel levels it gets quite noisy. I've tuned this to look a little better but you may be able to achieve similar effects by just general adjustments. This version of the plugin now uses lookup tables to correct raw channel values of levels 0 to 99 for each R,G,B channel at ISOs 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200. The initial values I used for these lookup tables was based on the measurements that I took with the 20step grey scale wedge above. This proved to be an excellent starting point however it was clear that a small amount of manual tuning was beneficial for optimum performance, the discrepancy probably caused by small errors in my measurements. A big challenge was how do you make adjustments to a 15 lookup tables each with 100 floating point numbers? Manually tuning 1500 floating point numbers was clearly not realistic. So to tune the calibration curves I had to first develop an tool that parsed the C++ header files and rendered a curve with draggable adjustment points. This adjustable curve is displayed along with the original so that it is very easy to judge even small changes. When the \"write curve\" button is clicked the application creates an updated look-up table by cubic spline interpolation between the adjustment points and merges this back into the header file. This allowed quick round-trip adjust-test-adjust... cycles for each lookup table: --img--  The new version is available from my download page: http://blog.perkins.org.uk/downloads I hope it helps, Jonathan", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/229863-correcting-the-green-shadows/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-2864431", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "229863-correcting-the-green-shadows", "result": true, "Selector": "i could make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "just a quick heads-up for anyone using my m240 'green shadows' lightroom plugin to let you know a new version is now available. the previous versions used a single correction algorithm that was optimised for iso200 but was not very effective for higher isos. i always felt it should be possible to get better performance particularly around the mid isos 400-800. so i set about converting the application to use individual look-up tables for each iso. that was the easy part, but how do you build all the correction curves?

However, political discussion may also include images...a thousand words etc. This is harder to moderate. Just think back to the photographs posted here during the Israel Gaza war. Some were posted for human interest and their photographic merit. Separating these from their potential political overtones, or others obviously posted to make a political comment was difficult. Many of us found it a very polarising and confronting time here on the Forum (as I found some of the material posted offensive and biased, and not what I wanted to confront on a photographic forum I go to for recreation). Often the photographs were allowed but comment to offset or balance their implications was discouraged. A lot of political images and comments were posted at that time before being 'moderated/modified'. Overall, the Mods did manage to steer the Forum well through that difficult time. Yet I read the Greek thread with interest but dispassionately as my political views on it are more 'emotionally detached'. So for some people political discussion is an interesting and intellectual exercise but for others the same subject can be very difficult and confronting. I can understand Andreas position on political (and I assume religious) discussion but it is indeed a fine line. I take your point Mark, and of course we all understand why there is moderation, even though some of us regret the fact. But I'm making a slightly different point. Since we all tend to be half-blind when it comes to politics, and find it harder to recognise things as political the closer they are to our own points of view, it is very hard for any moderator to effectively monitor political content. So we end up with a fairly simplistic approach which only recognises overtly political content, e.g. party politics and elections and so on, and almost entirely miss the point that a photo of a glass of wine on a restaurant table can carry as strong a political message as a debate about whether to vote for Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton. Everything has context, but no one is omniscient and no one can read all the signals all the time. That is why I find photography such a profoundly exciting and important subject, by the way. The point is, whether something is interpreted as political is down to the interpreter. It is subjective. Of course there'll be some common ground: we all twitch as soon as someone uses the word \"Thatcher\" because we recognise the obvious signals, regardless of our political leanings. This leaves the way open for insidious and frequently unintentional political messages to get through the whole time. So what I'm saying is this: it isn't really anything to do with avoiding politics. It is simply a commercial algorithm, but who knows whether it works?

'm -----> making !!!  a slightly different point. since we all tend to be half-blind when it comes to politics, and find it harder to recognise things as political the closer they are to our own points of view, it is very hard for any moderator to effectively monitor political content. so we end up with a fairly simplistic approach which only recognises overtly political content, e.g. party politics and elections and so on, and almost entirely miss the point that a photo of a glass of wine on a restaurant table can carry as strong a political message as a debate about whether to vote for donald trump or hilary clinton. everything has context, but no one is omniscient and no one can read all the signals all the time. that is why i find photography such a profoundly exciting and important subject, by the way. the point is, whether something is interpreted as political is down to the interpreter. it is subjective. of course there'll be some common ground: we all twitch as soon as someone uses the word \"thatcher\" because we recognise the obvious signals, regardless of our political leanings. this leaves the way open for insidious and frequently unintentional political messages to get through the whole time. so what i'm saying is this: it isn't really anything to do with avoiding politics. it is simply a commercial algorithm, but who knows whether it works? who knows how popular the site might be if it were different? of course finding out the answer to that question would be too commercially risky an experiment so we stick with what works well enough. but since i value this forum so highly,and take photography so seriously, i really don't like the way we kid ourselves that we're doing something good here, that we're avoiding upsetting our sensitive members and keeping everything nice and friendly by avoiding that nasty subject of politics. we're not.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 119252, "year": "2015"}, {"autor": "IkarusJohn", "date": "2015-07-23 10:48:00", "content": "I hate to get political, but just because there's a rule, it doesn't mean that we should not question it?

Sometimes for some stations (esp busy ones with lots a ppl passing through), those barriers are already open. Please don't just walk through without putting in your ticket or touching your Suica card on the sensor. There's (obviously) a body sensor before the barriers that will detect that a person is passing through that hasn't put their ticket and the barriers will close. The logic for why they remain open (instead of closed) during busy periods is just to smoothen the flow of traffic - the assumption made though is that everyone will put their tickets/touch the sensor. Talking about tall structures, you could go to Skytree too. I've actually not been there myself. Probably a good time now when the weather is still clear from summer pollution (therefore good views of the sea of buildings & Mt Fuji in the background). W.R.T. shops, I personally prefer MapCamera in Shinjuku to look at Leica gear more than the Leica Ginza store itself. There's more Ltd Ed on display in MapCamera. About taking off shoes, no holes in socks ;-)!! I've got caught once or twice before in the past. Some local restaurants you go to would require you to take off your shoes too (esp for those tatami floored izakayas). Finally, an important word to learn is \"sumimasen\" (\"sue me masen\") - it's primarily \"excuse me\" but generic enough to be used for a mild thank you, a mild sorry, or just to get attention. e.g. In an izakaya restaurant to get the attention of a waiter/waitress, you can stick your hand up and shout sumimasen. If they offer you a wet towel (oshiburi) to wipe your hands you can receive it and a gentle sumimasen, domo. If you walk in the streets and accidentally bump someone, you can say sumimasen. Similarly if you want to get pass them you can say sumimasen to get their attention that you want to walk pass them.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/222897-asia-one-challenge-2015/page/11/?tab=comments#comment-2814189", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "222897-asia-one-challenge-2015", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "some things to try in tokyo - the barriers of the stations will open by inserting the ticket to the barrier . it will seemingly re-appear immediately two to three steps behind the barrier. it travels pretty fast through the machine, while it is also validated. once, -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  a small dot with a pencil to ensure that it is the same ticket. the alternative is a rfid suica-card \u2013 londoners will know the principle from their oyster-cards. i also found it impressive to see the number of people passing at rush hour through the large stations like shinjuku, shinagawa, or tokyo. the tokyo metropolitan government building at shinjuku station is open to the public at the 45th floor, which allows a view over the city, skyscrapers stretching to the horizon in all directions. it is a good way of getting a feeling for the size of the city. sometimes, there are mobile earthquake simulators at the stations. please remember to take off the shoes before entering, since technically they are living rooms. stefan [this post is gonna be all voer the place] good point. sometimes for some stations (esp busy ones with lots a ppl passing through), those barriers are already open. please don't just walk through without putting in your ticket or touching your suica card on the sensor. there's (obviously) a body sensor before the barriers that will detect that a person is passing through that hasn't put their ticket and the barriers will close. the logic for why they remain open (instead of closed) during busy periods is just to smoothen the flow of traffic - the assumption made though is that everyone will put their tickets/touch the sensor. talking about tall structures, you could go to skytree too. i've actually not been there myself. probably a good time now when the weather is still clear from summer pollution (therefore good views of the sea of buildings & mt fuji in the background). w.r.t. shops, i personally prefer mapcamera in shinjuku to look at leica gear more than the leica ginza store itself. there's more ltd ed on display in mapcamera. about taking off shoes, no holes in socks ;-)!! i've got caught once or twice before in the past. some local restaurants you go to would require you to take off your shoes too (esp for those tatami floored izakayas). finally, an important word to learn is \"sumimasen\" (\"sue me masen\") - it's primarily \"excuse me\" but generic enough to be used for a mild thank you, a mild sorry, or just to get attention. e.g. in an izakaya restaurant to get the attention of a waiter/waitress, you can stick your hand up and shout sumimasen. if they offer you a wet towel (oshiburi) to wipe your hands you can receive it and a gentle sumimasen, domo. if you walk in the streets and accidentally bump someone, you can say sumimasen. similarly if you want to get pass them you can say sumimasen to get their attention that you want to walk pass them.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 134155, "year": "2015"}, {"autor": "Torgian", "date": "2015-05-12 14:44:00", "content": " Not suer if this has been touched on or not yet, but,,, To those taking the shinkansen over to Kyoto: your ticket will allow you to go to one local station anywhere from the JR line locally.

For those interested in that problem, if you use Auto focus in that instance, when you push the shutter halfway to turn on the auto focus, it gains/brightens up the screen so you can see via the lcd/Evf till it gains focus, then the exposure simulation kicks back in and goes black. So I wish there was a way for exposure simulation to be turned off. When I met with Leica in Melbourne, they hadn't seen these issues. I was able to test one of their T cameras and it showed all 3 faults described here along with my camera. Their camera was on the old firmware 1.31 mine on 1.41.

I have read of people actually removing the lens coatings from their lens front element due to obsessive over-cleaning. That does not help your image quality, even if your front & rear lens elements are surgically sterile. My usual lens cleaning regimen is to use a Giotto rocket blower bulb to blow dust off my front element. This usually is sufficient. If I have a stubborn dust particle, I will knock it loose with a horse hair lens brush and then use the blower. Once in a great while, I will get a rain drop on my front element that dries and leaves a water spot. for this, I use a microfiber cloth with photographic lens cleaner spray applied to the cloth. My two microfiber cloths that I use on my M lenses are stored in a ziplock bag and are used only on my camera lenses. I have a second lens cloth that I carry in my pocket, which is for cleaning my glasses. This cloth is never used on a camera lens. I wash my camera lens cleaning cloths by hand using a bit of laundry detergent in a clean bowl, rinse multiple times, then wring them out and hang them on a plastic coat hanger to air dry in a dust free area, just the same as if I were hanging just developed rolls of film to dry. Of course, the wash and rinse water is either distilled water or purified bottled drinking water. Maybe I'm a bit obsessive with the cloths I use on my megadollar Leica M lenses, but then again I have never scratched a lens element by careless cleaning. --img--  I have not used a UV filter for lens protection until I began experimenting with this practice very recently. If I discover that a high quality UV filter like B+W or Heliopan does not degrade image quality, I may begin shooting with UV filters on my lenses all the time. At present, I only put a UV filter on a lens if I am photographing in a very windy, dry & dusty place where dirt and dust are in the air, or in a situation where I am in very close proximity to people, as in photographing at an event like a music festival, sports event, etc. I have never had a lens front element damaged due to not using a UV filter in 35+ years of photography.

Here's a few modifications to the workflow I'm going to try: Still shoot DNG+JPEG, but use smaller SD cards (16GB) and do intra-day on-the-go backups to the WD wireless drive (2TB). The aim here is to minimize loading time at the end-of-day, especially avoiding the supremely slow loading time to the iPad camera roll. As loading to the wireless drive takes place, review the shots via iPad wirelessly using the WD app Shortlist candidates as usual by electing to \"Open in Photos\", which will launch the camera roll so that the JPEG will be saved Likewise, if I would like to develop any of the candidate shots, open the DNG in PhotoGene This allows me to achieve 2 more capabilities: Reduce the time-to-load dramatically by not loading the candidates to the iPad camera roll, and Make backups at the same time.

Also, if I always develop 2 rolls at once....if I develop 1 roll do I have to use half of the solutions or can I stick to the normal 600ml? The dilution mistake should produce lower contrast negatives - but not nothing. For the quantity, your instructions from the tank should tell you how much developer you need for 1 roll. Or just test it out with empty reels. Philipp's point is worth considering - if you use 1/2 the developer and by mistake put the sigle roll of film in the top of the tank, you will certainly have problems. As you agitate during development, some solution will get onto the film, but the effect would be difficult to predict. Not only the developer, but the fixer. But you clearly are making some variety of mistake - developing 1 roll in a 2 roll tank is no problem, and there should be no tricks. Common sense rules.

Recently i bumt in to very well priced and good condition grey M9.. it just swept me of my feet. Im sure you heard a lot bla bla bla,like how it changed the way someone photographed before..that it is \"an extencion of the eye..\" and all that stuff, but for me its simplicity of the camera,that i cant get enough with, it feels great,just to take pictures and thats all ,what about photography should be. For the lens ive got VC 35/1.4 MC for now , i cant beleave the IQ im getting, not to mention rendering and character.Currently im selling some of my fuji stuff and looking around for 50mm. This time gotta be Leica one. I never said so,but this time im pretty sure im in the right hands now..or i should say other way around..ive got the right camera for me.

The discussion shows some of the aspects I have to take into account before changing the structure of the forum. Right now the most dominant structure comes from the product systems - M, Q, T, X etc. plus historica, photo forum, general discussion, and the forum itself. - If we make the question film or digital more important it's going to be a different structure. - If we split up the existing film forum we are creating a 4th level - which reduces IMHO the usability and visibility - What shall I do with existing film-related subforums like 'Leica M7/MP' or 'Darkroom'? R-System except for DMR? The problem is, that we have a tree structure without the option to have the same content in different places of the tree...

Thank you for your comment. When I wrote about the \"SL\" cameras I was speaking about a group of reflex cameras that were left out that I unfortunately apparently did not clarify adequately. I will try to do better here: Adam had specifically excluded \"R\" mount cameras entirely when he wrote his original text. He later corrected this in his Post #17 above. What I was referring to was the group of reflex cameras that preceded the introduction of the \"R\" mount lenses & their cameras: The Leicaflex , The Leicaflex SL, The Leicaflex SL MOT, The Leicaflex SL2 & The Leicaflex SL2 MOT. These are the 5. The confusion may have arisen with my use of the shortened term \"SL\" which many people use as a way of indicating the earlier cameras (Not all actually \"SL\") which take a group of cameras which sometimes do not interface correctly with the later series of \"R\" mount lenses. But: All of the film \"M's\", Various Leicaflex models & \"R's\" use the same film so that once out of the camera the rest would be the same. I was using the exclusion of the Leicaflex models from the \"R\" section as an example of how the exclusion of the Leicaflex models was also missed by him.

Best Regards, Michael Hi Michael, First, please be aware that, in spite of being forum member since Nov. 2002, I have very few posts. I am shy to expose my ignorance and growing mental incapacities. I am very cautious about giving offense, in spite of my best intentions. I have had trouble comprehending your posts. I am intensely interested in the viewfinders of M film cameras, the shutter in M film cameras, operating M film cameras successfully and film that goes into M film cameras. Adam's suggested hierarchy fits perfectly with my interests. Everything else in the Leica forum is just something I have to wade through to get to what interests me. I did not even know that Leica's excellent SL cameras were not in the R camera section. It's been decades since I was interested in SLR cameras, film or digital. I do not know if your \"end up making Film Photography more & more tangential & irrelevant to the main thrust of the Forum. Not more inclusive.\" comment is correct or not. In the last 13 years, the Leica Forum became more and more irrelevant to me as it changed to the current organization. This was the website which originally helped me decide to purchase an 90 APO Summicron and an M7. As the Leica Forum defined its \"main thrust\", I was tempted to sell all my Leica equipment and shoot 120 film. Since Doc Henry's thread, I have purchased a used M4-P, a camera which I have come to love using, unlike the new M6 I purchased in 1985 which was always \"within Leica tolerances\" but never became something I could rely on with 100% confidence. I have also kept the M7, and learned to work with it with affection, not hostility. I have shot four times as much film since I started viewing Doc's thread last January than I used to shoot in a year. To me, Charlie Watts' response to Mick Jagger's original provocative assertion \"You're MY drummer!\" is humorous. I hope you will think so too. Charlie Watts replied \"I ain't YOUR drummer, you're MY singer!\" I'm confident Adam's suggested hierarchy will make it easier for people interested in film images from Leica M equipment to consider the Leica Forum a resource for them. I have read that some people start out with digital equipment and become curious about using Leica film equipment.
