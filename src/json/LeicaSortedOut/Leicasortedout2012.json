ISO is not really part of exposure in digital photography. Shutter and aperture speed control the amount of light that hits the sensor, and the ISO just boosts the amplification after the fact. Whether one should boost that signal with the camera's internal analog or digital gain boost (ISO,) or use the raw converter to boost the gain after the fact, depends on the camera and raw converter. For example, if you shoot Canon, it is generally better to boost ISO in-camera up to higher ISOs. With several sensors, like in the M9, you can boost ISO in the raw converter, rather than raising in-camera ISO, and potentially even improve your DR by doing it this way. Of course, results are highly dependent on the raw converter being used. So, I agree that exposure is important, but, in digital, exposure really only refers to your shutter speed and aperture. ISO is just camera gain after the fact, which can be done in different ways. Several cameras are essentially ISO-less, meaning that you can focus on the amount of light hitting the sensor, and boost the gain later in the raw converter. p.s. because of the above, ETTR really only applies to shooting at base ISO, btw. ETTR can be good from a SNR standpoint, although, as others have mentioned, it can be a problem in regards to color. It can also be a problem if one underexposes the subject too much in an attempt to save highlights that may not be as important to the shot. Yes, I have no idea how digital photography works. Thank you for pointing that out to me as the crowning moment to your SIX posts here. I'm not sure how I managed to make it this far in life. If you dont have an ISO to work with be it 160, 500, 1000, or whatever, you dont have an exposure to figure out. Shooting all your exposures at 160 and ramping it up in your raw converter doesn't make you much of a photographer, in fact it may be the most fundamentally unsound approach to the art and science of the craft of photography I have ever encountered. Boosting the ISO later? Why? Where's the SKILL in that? Nailing it, both moment AND exposure, is more important to me, Nikon, Sony, or meterless Leica. You may as well shoot with your phone. Show me your M9 histograms, files, and your final examples of this impossible to follow technique.

It seems as though the whole concept of it is flawed and following it would yield nothing but unusable exposures. What do I know? I don't understand digital photography. You managed this far because camera makers decided to call camera gain \"ISO,\" in order for film shooters making the transition to digital easily understandable, especially since our cameras are still geared towards jpeg output. If you're shooting jpeg, it certainly does matter, and I should have made the distinction that we're talking about raw. Either way, you know the base ISO of the M9, 160, and that is all the guide that you really need. Exposure is simply the amount of light hitting the sensor, which is not dictated by ISO in a digital camera. Quite frankly, what I'm talking about is nothing new, and is a common topic in other forums. Feel free to criticize my 6 posts, but I've only recently rejoined this forum, and, although I'm embarrassed to admit it, I have something like 15,000 posts in other enthusiast forums, so please don't go there. I'm not going to take the time to do tests which you can do on your own, but here's one of several links illustrating what I'm talking about from raw expert Guillermo Luijk. The thread is in regard to the Pentax K-5, another essentially ISO-less camera. Noise and DR comparision: Canon 5D vs 5D2 vs 7D vs Pentax K5 p.s. I do still use ISO 800 or 1250 on the M9, because I like to have a usable jpeg review on the back of the camera. Also, with my NEX cameras, since the LCD and EVF rely on boosting the ISO in order to see the frame properly, I boost ISO in those cameras, too. So, even though I may be loosing a little DR by boosting ISO, it is often still worth it to me.

Andy, Thanks for your post. As always very informative. Sorry if I gave you a headache with this thread. We got quite a bit of wet snow over night. It brought down a power line in the neighborhood and we were without power until a few minutes ago, so my computers were cut off the Internet. Maybe I should explain briefly what I hope to get out of this thread. Basically, at a minimum, a rough estimate of Leica lens resolution limits as they developed over time, and hopefully accurate numbers for some lenses. Despite power loss, I was able to read on my iPad some older material of Erwin Puts that I had downloaded before and found some more useful information about Leica lens resolution limits. I plan to summarize that later. If I understand you correctly, then the corresponding line pairs per mm numbers I computed for the three different sensors should be viewed as upper limits due to the effects you describe. And 01af seems to imply to cut back the numbers even further by another factor of 2. Interesting. With regards to the D800E, a Nikon manager stated in an interview, that for cost reasons in order to have the same register distance for the D800 and D800E, they left the first part of the filter in the D800E. This splits the signal in two. So, instead of splitting it again subsequently (in the other direction) as in the D800, they just recombine the split signals, effectively canceling the first split. I doubt Nikon will release the D800E to market unless they convinced themselves of a satisfactorily implementation. Thanks also for the pointers to Modern or Pop. Photography reviews.

[u]\"so we get: \u2022 leica m9: 145 pixel/mm corresponds to 96 lp/mm. \u2022 nikon d800e: 205 pixel/mm corresponds to 137 lp/mm. \u2022 sony nex-7: 255 pixel/mm corresponds to 171 lp/mm.[/u] ... so long as one does not take into account any aa filtering, or other blurring. some say there is noticeable loss of per-pixel resolution between the m8 and the m9, simply because the m9 has a thicker cover glass/ir filter (0.7mm vs. the m8's 0.5mm - i don't see it myself). the nikon d800e uses a \"reversing\" aa filter - one blurring layer that supposedly cancels out the effect of the other blurring layer - which i doubt works perfectly, but no doubt restores some sharpness. the sony nex-7 has - who knows what level of aa filtering (fairly little, from the samples i've seen, but probably not zero). it seems to me you are trying to -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  hard, quantitative results based on data that is going to, by necessity (and literally, when it comes to aa filters) always be \"fuzzy.\" lots of things that sony or nikon or leica know, but are not public domain. you can probably find modern or pop. photography reviews** of some of your earlier lenses that gives the resolution the magazine measured on an optical bench (they used to do that, pre-1980s). but if the review reports \"87 lppm at f/8\" - well, the next lens off the assembly line might have tested at 83 lines, or 90 lines. **my college library had mp or pp back-issues, in hard copy, from 1945-1980 at one point. andy, thanks for your post. as always very informative. sorry if i gave you a headache with this thread. we got quite a bit of wet snow over night. it brought down a power line in the neighborhood and we were without power until a few minutes ago, so my computers were cut off the internet. maybe i should explain briefly what i hope to get out of this thread. basically, at a minimum, a rough estimate of leica lens resolution limits as they developed over time, and hopefully accurate numbers for some lenses. despite power loss, i was able to read on my ipad some older material of erwin puts that i had downloaded before and found some more useful information about leica lens resolution limits. i plan to summarize that later. if i understand you correctly, then the corresponding line pairs per mm numbers i computed for the three different sensors should be viewed as upper limits due to the effects you describe. and 01af seems to imply to cut back the numbers even further by another factor of 2. interesting. with regards to the d800e, a nikon manager stated in an interview, that for cost reasons in order to have the same register distance for the d800 and d800e, they left the first part of the filter in the d800e. this splits the signal in two. so, instead of splitting it again subsequently (in the other direction) as in the d800, they just recombine the split signals, effectively canceling the first split. i doubt nikon will release the d800e to market unless they convinced themselves of a satisfactorily implementation. thanks also for the pointers to modern or pop. photography reviews. i will see what my local library has. many thanks again. i appreciate your help.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 91842, "year": "2012"}, {"autor": "Knors", "date": "2012-01-09 08:40:00", "content": "The longest should be the best, prob not much difference between a 50mm at .7m and 90mm at 1m I made the final shot with a 28 mm closest distance 50 mm which did not work at once however when i made a crop of the phone screen part and saved this. it worked perfectly", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/139872-geotagging-m-cameras-made-easy-gps4cam/?tab=comments#comment-1892736", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "139872-geotagging-m-cameras-made-easy-gps4cam", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "the longest should be the best, prob not much difference between a 50mm at .7m and 90mm at 1m -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  the final shot with a 28 mm closest distance 50 mm which did not work at once however when -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  a crop of the phone screen part and saved this. it worked perfectly", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 92635, "year": "2012"}, {"autor": "MPJMP", "date": "2012-08-28 15:39:00", "content": " This is pure fantasy, but I thought I'd throw it out there to see who might have similar ideas and preferences. Awhile back, I came up with an idea of what my perfect Leica digital M camera would be. The concept would be to have a digital M camera with a reduced feature set that more closely replicated the experience of classic film Leica photography. The resulting camera might, in theory, be less expensive to produce than a full fledged M9, thereby constituting a \"budget\" model. The important specs would be: 1) NO rear LCD. Think how revolutionary that would be. One of the \"benefits\" of film photography that is often touted by its proponents is that you are free from the potential distraction that a rear LCD brings. No \"chimping\" your shots. No fiddling with menu settings. You remain in the moment, engaged with your subject. Of course, with enough discipline you can do that with an LCD, but by removing it entirely you remove the temptation to go back and look at your results and instead focus on getting the next perfect shot. Another thing you remove is a major production cost, which results in a lower price point for the consumer. Instead of an LCD, there would be a traditional wheel to set ISO. There would be no other buttons on the rear panel. When you think about it, other than focus, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO the only other essential setting that needs to be made is selecting the capture format: RAW, JPEG, etc. Which leads to... 2) Capture in RAW (DNG) format only. To make the camera as simple and pure as possible, and to ensure only the best quality original files, the camera would only capture in a RAW format such as Adobe's DNG \"digital negative\" format. There is then no need to set things such as white balance, compression, megapixel quality, etc.-- the types of things that you might have spent time fiddling with on the LCD screen. All image tweaking would be done in post-processing. 3) Shutter cocking lever. Got this idea from the Epson RD-1 from years ago. By deleting both the rear LCD and motor for cocking the shutter you would conserve a significant amount of battery power. A single battery charge might last weeks, instead of hours or days. It also replicates an important part of the classic Leica M experience lacking in the M8/9. 4) Hybrid optical viewfinder with electronic framelines. I've been led to believe that one of the biggest costs in producing an M camera is the installation and calibration of the frame lines. Replacing these with elctronic framelines, such as used in the Fuji X series, saves money and provides for potentially more accurate and reliable framing. 5) As for focusing, I don't have any great ideas other than keeping the tried and true optical rangefinder. While it is expensive, there is no better way I am aware of to accurately focus a manual M lens. 6) Return of the M8's top panel LCD for battery status and frame count. With no large rear panel LCD, that would become a necessity. 7) The weather-sealed bottom plate would be removed to reveal the battery compartment, SD card slot, and an industry standard USB connection. What are your thoughts? I have no realistic expectation that such a camera would ever be produced either by Leica or any 3rd party, but I've never heard some of these ideas tossed around before.

I was recommended one of those light-tight changing bags. I have looked around a bit and found that they exist in different sizes. What should I consider in choosing a changing bag? As for processing tanks and reels, I've seen several different brands and that some tanks are made of plastic whereas others are metal. Should I go for plastic or metal tanks and reels? Are certain brands better than others? I have seen tanks which allow for two 35 strips and one 120 strip which I thought could be a good one to get since I'm curious about Hasselblad. Good or bad thinking? Thermometers, do I need one of those 20\u20ac electronic ones or can I go with a simpler/cheaper one? I realise temperature accuracy is pretty important. Is it doable - as in not overly complicated and more expensive than lab processing - to develop negative colour at home, and even slide film? I'm just wondering. I realise the learning curve is pretty steep so will begin with BW. I understand developers is a whole universe so I wish to begin as simple as possible. To just bring out what the film - I use Tri-X almost exclusively - is like, what should I use? Is a stop bath necessary? This guy says he just uses water. Sorry for all the newbie questions and thanks for your help Philip Hi Philip, I am not an expert but I was in your shoes just 6 months ago--wondering \"is it doable\" and can I manage? I have tried three film types and two developers. Tri-X in D-76 (well Fomadon P, a D-76 clone) is my favorite. Powdered developers are cheap--keep in mind. Nothing wrong with starting with Tri-X. I didn't buy a changing bag; it is very expensive--that was one reason, and the other was that I don't like the idea of having to work in a confined space. Instead I use a walk in closet which I made light tight. I have a work space in there and that works well. It took some time to set this up--but I am glad I did. If you must use a bag make sure you get a large one as everyone is saying here. I use the Paterson system 4 with the plastic reels. It is easy, especially if you are working with the film on the roll (possible if you leave the leader exposed when you rewind); it gets more complicated when you have to take the film off the roll, but still is very doable. The one weakness with plastic reels is that they don't work well wet. Make sure the reels are dry and I mean bone dry. Buy PATERSON. I was (and am) trying to save money and I read that it is not necessary to use a stop bath, water will do. The instructions I got were to fill the tank four times with water and do 30 seconds of agitation for each fill--or something like that. What a PITA--filling and taking the cap on and off, geez. I tried it once. Afterwards, I bought pure white vinegar at the grocery store (cheap) and make my own stop bath diluting the vinegar with water before I start developing. Works well. A good mercury thermometer gives almost instant readings; helps you when you are trying to get the temperature right.I heard they are illegal in the EU or something like that. I bought mine in New York City and brought it back over here (Norway). I use my own wrist watch for the all important time keeping, after trying the cell phone and the lap top computer--they are just unnecessary complications. I just wait until the second hand reaches 15 seconds before the top of the dial, pour in the developer (takes about 15 seconds) and start timing. Oh, I WRITE DOWN the time on a piece of paper as I start--avoids confusion. Yes, get a photo-flow product for the last step and run the film in and out of it a few times after it has sat in the mixture. Don't use this stuff in your tank because it builds up and ruins your reels. I take the film off the reel and put the photo-flo in a plastic potato salad container! It sits there 5 minutes, I take the film edges between finger and thumb and pull the film out of the container and then let it curl back in. Do it a few times. I have never had problems with spotting or streaking. Last thing: you will save money and you will in all likelihood come to like doing this. It's exciting to see what you have on your roll of film and to realize that you have done it yourself!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/186748-need-some-advice-re-equipment-for-bw-home-development/?tab=comments#comment-2102410", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "186748-need-some-advice-re-equipment-for-bw-home-development", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "so i have decided to learn how to develop bw at home and had a few questions. i was recommended one of those light-tight changing bags. i have looked around a bit and found that they exist in different sizes. what should i consider in choosing a changing bag? as for processing tanks and reels, i've seen several different brands and that some tanks are made of plastic whereas others are metal. should i go for plastic or metal tanks and reels? are certain brands better than others? i have seen tanks which allow for two 35 strips and one 120 strip which i thought could be a good one to get since i'm curious about hasselblad. good or bad thinking? thermometers, do i need one of those 20\u20ac electronic ones or can i go with a simpler/cheaper one? i realise temperature accuracy is pretty important. is it doable - as in not overly complicated and more expensive than lab processing - to develop negative colour at home, and even slide film? i'm just wondering. i realise the learning curve is pretty steep so will begin with bw. i understand developers is a whole universe so i wish to begin as simple as possible. to just bring out what the film - i use tri-x almost exclusively - is like, what should i use? is a stop bath necessary? this guy says he just uses water. sorry for all the newbie questions and thanks for your help philip hi philip, i am not an expert but i was in your shoes just 6 months ago--wondering \"is it doable\" and can i manage? i have tried three film types and two developers. tri-x in d-76 (well fomadon p, a d-76 clone) is my favorite. powdered developers are cheap--keep in mind. nothing wrong with starting with tri-x. i didn't buy a changing bag; it is very expensive--that was one reason, and the other was that i don't like the idea of having to work in a confined space. instead -----> i !!!  use a walk in closet which -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  light tight. i have a work space in there and that works well. it took some time to set this up--but i am glad i did. if you must use a bag make sure you get a large one as everyone is saying here. i use the paterson system 4 with the plastic reels. it is easy, especially if you are working with the film on the roll (possible if you leave the leader exposed when you rewind); it gets more complicated when you have to take the film off the roll, but still is very doable. the one weakness with plastic reels is that they don't work well wet. make sure the reels are dry and i mean bone dry. buy paterson. i was (and am) trying to save money and i read that it is not necessary to use a stop bath, water will do. the instructions i got were to fill the tank four times with water and do 30 seconds of agitation for each fill--or something like that. what a pita--filling and taking the cap on and off, geez. i tried it once. afterwards, i bought pure white vinegar at the grocery store (cheap) and make my own stop bath diluting the vinegar with water before i start developing. works well. a good mercury thermometer gives almost instant readings; helps you when you are trying to get the temperature right.i heard they are illegal in the eu or something like that. i bought mine in new york city and brought it back over here (norway). i use my own wrist watch for the all important time keeping, after trying the cell phone and the lap top computer--they are just unnecessary complications. i just wait until the second hand reaches 15 seconds before the top of the dial, pour in the developer (takes about 15 seconds) and start timing. oh, i write down the time on a piece of paper as i start--avoids confusion. yes, get a photo-flow product for the last step and run the film in and out of it a few times after it has sat in the mixture. don't use this stuff in your tank because it builds up and ruins your reels. i take the film off the reel and put the photo-flo in a plastic potato salad container! it sits there 5 minutes, i take the film edges between finger and thumb and pull the film out of the container and then let it curl back in. do it a few times. i have never had problems with spotting or streaking. last thing: you will save money and you will in all likelihood come to like doing this. it's exciting to see what you have on your roll of film and to realize that you have done it yourself!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 107508, "year": "2012"}, {"autor": "MPerson", "date": "2012-01-16 11:51:00", "content": " It is now 9 months since we moved in to the new house and things seem to have settled down.

That said, I still have to prepare food in here on rare occasions, so it can all be easily & hygienically converted kitchen<=>darkroom as needed. I no longer develop film, this is printing only (used to have a brilliant film drying cabinet though, regret selling it;). The upside-down trays there are on a 16x20inch 3-tray ladder (excellent space-saving thing from Leedal of Chicago, http://www.leedal.com), when set up each tray down sits further out from the one above so you just slip the paper from one down into the next below. I don't actually sit the trays on that side bench there when full of chems, I have a fold-up table set up in the middle of the room there for that - the side bench I prefer to keep clean for paper/negs. The 'enlarger bench' is covered with a sheet of plastic tucked in 'round the edges when not in use - especially important as in fine to hot weather I often have both the front & back door (see it to the right there) open for a thru-breeze, and the air can be quite dusty in these parts, you've got to keep things well covered up. The enlarger has its own cover. There's a thick double-layered black woolen 'theatre' drape there over the entry to the hall going up inside the house, had it made special by a company that does make them for theatres/cinemas, and the back door has foam around the edges that blocks light when closed. The windows have specially made (a company here in Australia that makes them for shift workers in hot bright places, http://www.bedroomblackout.com) fabric-covered foam panels that fit right into the window spaces, same for the windows in the bathroom which adjoins the kitchen off to the left there. I have moved a lot, have had a pretty similar set-up wherever I've been, obviously have to have things like the window panels re-done, which can cost a bit when you add it all up time after time, but who's counting, you do it because you love printing! Now, I might not shoot much film anymore, and really I don't print very often at all, but I say that as long as I possess negatives I want to have a darkroom in which to print them - for me that's non-negotiable. Mm, well, I hope this is of interest, or helps someone who might be thinking of making a darkroom at home.

Original charts and tables here: Using RODINAL If photographers use it at 1:100 or higher dilutions, they are of course free to do so and use whatever film rating they need - but they are \"outside the envelope\" and in uncharted territory in terms of what the creators of Rodinal had in mind. The thread is about stand development and I think you have gone off track somewhat in quoting 'official' sites and sources for standard film development at normal dilutions. It doesn't really add anything to the discussion about stand development. As you dispute the lessons learned by other people in the use of higher dilutions (as well as normal dilutions), and you have opined on the theory of processing with various developers (but without offering a single practical view of your own) I just don't see your point other than in your grinding negativity towards stand development. It sounds as if you think it is the work of the devil. A case in point, you say more than once that Rodinal doesn't reduce film speed, and that a longer time or more agitation should be used etc. This is very easy to understand up to a point, but makes no sense when the whole idea of stand development is not to agitate the film in the developer. I could go on with other instances of you not 'getting it', but life is too short. I do trust you have your own practical experiences of using stand development (not from a manufacturers chart or pure theory), so let's hear those.

Developing film well is harder. Well includes clean drying ,filtered water, good chemical storage, proper agitation, matching contrast to paper/subject. It is like the difference between driving the family sedan and being a formula one driver. Then you have to learn not to use the massive development chart and not to listen to all the weird schemes people have invented and to quit trying the millions of combinations of film/developers. Buy a scale, some chemicals, some glass bottles, mix up some D76 and start learning. d76 will do a decent job on any film out there except the current generation of Delta 400 which requires Xtol or that undated white bottle of expensive stuff Ilford sells, forgetting the name for now. There is a marked improvement with either. You can get any look you want by diluting D76 from stock to 1:3. Start with 1:1.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/182617-like-the-idea-of-developing-film-but-think-its-too-complicated/?tab=comments#comment-2053560", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "182617-like-the-idea-of-developing-film-but-think-its-too-complicated", "result": false, "Selector": "developing", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "developing -----> film !!!  is easy.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 107648, "year": "2012"}, {"autor": "Wail", "date": "2012-07-03 08:03:00", "content": "Hi All, I posted this link in another part of LUF to a video I made, but thought it might help anyone here who'd like to develop film but worry it's too complicated or has mysterious 'black magic' attached to it?

If you want to start humbly (and economically, by Leica standards) you will find many Leica M camera bodies and lenses that can be purchased for around $1000-1500US for the body and $500-1000US for the lens. You just have to shop around, there are reasonably priced Leicas out there. If that isn't financially doable, you could find a nice FM2n or F3hp to use with your Nikon lenses for a song. I have seen good user F3hp bodies (rated at 8 to 8+) for sale at $275-300US. Regarding film availability, I would expect C41 and E6 film choices to dwindle over the years while B&W film choices will remain more or less stable - Kodak 's current terminal illness notwithstanding. I would expect there to be some sort of B&W film to be available for the foreseeable future. As for 25-50 years down the road, who knows? Film (along with paper and chemical) prices will continue to creep upward over the years, but so will the prices of everything else. Bulk loading is a way to save perhaps 20-25% on your film costs. Developing your own film is a big cost cutter for B&W film - B&W costs around $0.40 to $0.50US per roll to develop at home. Developing is actually an enjoyable activity (IMO). Developing film beats sitting for hours at a keyboard diddling with Photoshop. Again, JMHO.
