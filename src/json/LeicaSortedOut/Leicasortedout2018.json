I print large, and find 24mp to be very limiting for a 300dpi printer output. I can only imagine how good my 50 APO would be on a higher MP body for large prints. That lens (by itself) has certainly bumped up image quality from my M240 markedly, and the 50 APO lens for me has been worth every penny of cost, but for landscapes (and subjects with fine detail) the main weak spot for me of this \"system\" is low megapixel count. I've tried the Nikon D800, and even with a flapping DSLR mirror, there was no problem at all with getting pin sharp images off that 36mp sensor. I'd guess this would be even easier off a lower vibration rangefinder. If not an M with higher megapixel count, i would really hope that such resolution progress is made in the auto-focused SL or S ranges. I am recent Leica user with the purchase of my first Leica, the M10 in Nov. 2017. I'm still getting the hang of the system and manual focusing. For the past 4+ years, I have been a Fuji user. I do all of my printing on Epson inkjet printers. My current printer is the Epson P800 which handles paper up to 17\" wide. I have 16x20 prints from cropped images created with the Fuji X100S (16 mp files) and the image quality and sharpness is remarkable. I cannot tell the difference from prints made with this little camera and those hanging next to it made from my old Canon 5D Mk III system. If anyone here is serious about image quality and making prints larger than 20x30 inches, they should be using medium format gear. For my needs the M10 24mp files are more than adequate. The prints that I have made so far are amazing. Larger prints really show off the sharpness and micro-contrast of the Leica M prime lenses. I'm hooked. If you want the equivalent of buying a higher megapixel camera and you are a Lightroom user, I suggest that you try out Capture One Pro 11. I switched to Capture One Pro about 3 years ago because Lightroom didn't do such a great job with Fuji X trans sensor RAW files. Switching to Capture One Pro at that time was an immediate improvement in image quality and processing workflow speed. The last couple releases of Capture One Pro, now at version 11, have greatly improved layers and the DAM capabilities of the program. Good enough for my needs at least.

We tend to run on automatic as we age ... and the spatial and temporal perception is a bit less than when we were in our teens ... not to mention 20 30 and 40's. Does not mean that we have lost a lot of cognitive ability ... just that we are not able to process and recall peripheral details in hyperspace/time. Probably why any pilot needs a checklist ... and most of us when we are planning a big event do the same. So leaving things or walking away from a bag becomes fairly common. However a bit of planning can help ... I did a fair amount of traveling ... and learned to wrap the strap of the bag around my thigh when in a bar ... could not leave without it. We all would rather go out quickly but truth be told most accidents leave one permanently disabled ... paralysis ... tube feedings ... rehab without great recovery. So the assisted living starts a decade or two early. But all told ... life is short and one must find a balance between risk and reward ... which changes as our lives play themselves out. Hate to admit this but I quit traveling with expensive cameras ... watches ... clothing ... in my 30's. Doing medical relief missions in W Africa convinced me that I could capture the moment with a small throwaway camera. Unbelievable freedom ... all I had to protect was my passport and return ticket.

So earlier this week while out photographing a local get together with friends the camera failed to write the images to the card. (It was one of the 16gb Transcend cards that I've been using for a few years) I only noticed the issue when I went to chimp and saw that the images I had just made were not there. Earlier photos I'd taken previously that day and day before were still on the card. I took the card out and reseated it and then watched closely as I took another photo. As I viewed the photo it would only show the file name across the LCD and then disappear. Unfortunately, for the evening shoot as it was just a casual outing, I had not brought my bag with additional cards and the evening taking photos was a bust. Yea, I know backup backup backup. Anyway, I was able to normally import the existing files to my computer and probably realized that old SD cards can wear out. So rather than use SD Card Formatter and keep using the card I decided to buy new cards to replace my older cards that some are as old as my camera. As a suggestion and so far have had no issues I purchased 4 new SanDisk 16GB SDHC 80MB/s cards from https://www.bhphotovideo.com. I like the faster cards for import speed to the computer as the camera only manages less than 20MB/s write speeds.

I came to digital Leicas after a Cosina R-D1 and a pair of M-8.2 bodies. After shooting film seriously (as in when I began processing my own) since 1969, I was never comfortable with crop sensors. Once you begin learning the attributes and failings of your lenses when used FF, a crop sensor is like looking at the world though a toilet paper tube, what happened to all the periphery? Other failings of the M8.2 (besides the crop sensor) left me feeling there has to be more than this, c'mon Leica, after decades of film M cameras, you should do better. For me and my photography, the M9-P ticks all the boxes. I don't want ISO 6400+ from a digital M, I don't want 5+ FPS with an unlimited buffer from a digital M, it would be nice to have a native ISO 64 but I am comfortable at ISO 160. I wish I could still shoot color with my 21/3.4 Super Angulon but I manage fine with my 21 Elmarit ASPH, the 21 S.A. is still my go to choice for dedicated B & W with the M9-P. If I need a 6 digit ISO rating, I can reach for my Nikon Df and my kit of MF Nikkors. Not unlike when I worked daily with my trio of M6 (classics, pre-TTL) and needed something that was best done with a SLR. The RF experience is what it is, I've never tried to make my Leicas do what is better done with a SLR, and just as importantly, vice versa. When the M9 was announced, I was of a wait and see perspective after being let down by the M8-2. Eventually the M8.2 cameras reached a point that Leica gave me a fair trade-in towards the M9-P bodies I currently use. I seriously considered getting away from Leicas after the M9-P bodies each had sensor failures in a fairly short time. For the record, Nikon D700 bodies I bought new in 2008 are still fully functional and have never missed a shot or failed to deliver. When the Leica M9-P bodies were returned after the initial sensor replacement I set them on the back of my desk and couldn't bring myself to sell them but didn't have all that much faith in them either. Last April after about 2.5 years, I charged the M9-P batteries and unboxed the cameras. My daughter asked me to make some stylized portraits of her to match a set I made of her years ago with the M9-P when they were my daily, go-to cameras. Shooting the Canon 50/1.5 and 100/2.0 and 90 Elmar wide open all seemed well and it was like putting on an old pair of very comfortable shoes, the images were exactly what she had hoped for. A week later I was out with the CV 15/4.5 III and the sensor corrosion on my dedicated wide body was very apparent. I then tested the dedicated tele body with the same lens and it was even worse. I questioned myself for not selling them in 2015 when they were freshly back with new sensors. I quickly realized the folly of crying over spilled milk. I also realized I could not sell them in good conscious without revealing the sensor issues and if such was revealed, the price wouldn't be worth the effort to sell them. So off they went again to NJ for replacement sensors and short story, for now they are everything I ever hoped they would be. As of now, they again are my go-to cameras. Only time will tell but I have too much of my visual life established around the Leica RF approach to give it up now. Once I though the M4 was the best I could use, except for the M3 with fast or long lenses. Then the M6 showed itself as a significant improvement and I could get both a .72X VF and a .85X VF and cover the M4 & M3 needs. This is where I am, now, with the M9-P cameras, my digital RF needs are met. If one or both of my M9-P cameras needed replacing, I would very likely replace with the same.

Mainly though, I couldn't bear to part with it because, well, I use it a lot and I've been able to get around the sensor corrosion with Lightroom. But basically, yes, I have no excuse for not having it fixed for free. So why am I thinking about it now? before leaving for South America for six weeks, I purchased a CL and brought both bodies with me. I've found though that I've been using the CL far more than the M9, so maybe now might be the time to get the sensor replaced. Anyway, I've been looking at the Leica website about the sensor replacement. I know I have to pay, but I'm unsure on some of the wording. I got my M9 second hand in March 2013, bought it off eBay. I might have a receipt somewhere, but I don't think I ever registered it with Leica, given that it was used. So my question is this: will they replace the sensor given that it was bought used and I've no receipt? Thanks! Santiago Yes, Leica will replace the sensor regardless if you are the original owner or the 5th owner. They go by date of original sale to determine the camera's age in users' hands. If you are back in the USA, if only for simplicity's sake, send your M9 to New Jersey. I have a reply to a post earlier this year I made where I said I would say when my pair of M-9P bodies, both with corroded sensors, arrive back to me. I sent them in mid-April and I was informed by email yesterday and phone today, that they are going out 2nd Day Air / UPS and should be in my hands on Thursday. I offer this as a very recent example of what to expect time wise. Here's the rub on sensor corrosion. If you shoot longer lenses, at least 50mm, fairly wide open, (to be safe, I'd say f/2.8 and larger, you might never see some sensor corrosion. I had been exclusively using one of my bodies with either the Canon LTM 50/1.5 or the Canon LTM 100/2.0 and never saw corrosion. Only when I shot some with the 21/2.8 Asph stopped to f/16 with lots of sky was it apparent on the dedicated wide body. This prompted me to shoot the same lens on the dedicated long lens body and it was apparent the sensor corrosion was back with a vengeance in both cameras. Both cameras got replacement sensors in summer 2015, one for total failure and one for string of pearls corrosion. Personally I did not want to limit either of my cameras to shooting only wide open.

Question: given that the 8 has a small sensor, what are the highly recommended (and non-Leica lenses) that photographers recommend to use on it? What I mean is if one desires the same wide angle as, say, a 28mm or a 35mm? I am not sure if what I am asking makes sense.

I figured a lot of things out long ago, and tried to use the camera like I did in the 1960's, with my M2. I got most things working, but was never really satisfied with shooting with the Leica. My updated Nikon purchases every year were better suited for sports photography, and thinking back on it, I wasn't even using the Leica properly. So, it mostly sat in a safe for the past eight years or so, other than times when I got it out, bought Voigtlander lenses, and still felt I did better with my Nikons. Then I bought a Fuji X100, then X100s, and decided it was having a Leica on steroids. I was, and am, very happy with the Fuji. Actually, it was too easy. It did all the work, all I had to do was aim it. It wasn't as satisfying as years ago with my Leica cameras. A few weeks ago, I decided I'd give the M8 another try. The best way I know to learn, is to leave all my other cameras alone, and start using only the Leica - along with watching dozens of YouTube videos. In addition to my three film Leica and lenses for those cameras, I have two newer lenses from Leica (35mm and 50mm), and a 90mm Summicron, which needs a repair, and which is not really suitable for anything I plan to do with the Leica yet.... and two Voigtlander lenses I bought from Camera Quest, a 24mm lens, and an ultra-wide angle lens with viewfinder. I decided the 50mm Sumicron would be around 80mm, so it went back in my drawer, along with all my other lenses except my 35mm Summilux . I decided that will be my lens for the near future. First problem, none of my photos was really sharp. I asked someone about this at a Leica booth at B&H Photo many years ago, and was told the front of the lens was loose. Nobody I know is qualified to work on it, so it has been sitting for years. This time I looked it over closely, and found three microscopic screws around the outside of the lens. I slowly and evenly tightened them, and now the lens is fixed - as I found out today, wandering around with the camera, the images are all crisp and clear - I have no complaints. One of the photos I took had yellow grass - I guess I need to buy the filter to correct that, but for most of my photos, everything was fine. I need to find out what filter I have to buy to fix this. Using the camera: Being an idiot, I read somewhere that using the automatic controls was not a good idea, so I've been selecting aperture or shutter speed, then watching the red arrows and red dot under the image to get the right exposure for as long as I've had the camera. After spending the past few days at this (I'm slow) I found out how to set the shutter speed dial to \"A\", use auto-ISO, and the camera selected an ISO and displayed the shutter speed it wanted to use instead of the arrows and dots. I wish I knew this ten years ago. Oh well. I've been watching all the videos about whether the M8 is still useful in today's world (in my opinion, absolutely YES). I've also been watching the videos on zone focusing, candid photography, street photography, and so on.... I used to do that a lifetime ago with my M2, M3, and Nikon SP, but I've lost my edge because all my newer cameras have adjusted the settings and taken the photo before I can even start to figure out what I should do on the Leica. With the M8.2 today, once I learned to trust it, I just did \"aim and shoot\" much of the time. Aperture was set to f/11 and 90% of my images were fine. The camera picked whatever shutter speed it wanted, and presumably the ISO. I need to review what settings it selected. Changes I need to make.... to me, the camera was very uncomfortable to hold in my hand for \"grab shots\". It's fine for two hands, but not one hand. I will order one of those thumb grips tomorrow. I already have one on my Fuji X100s, and it made a world of difference. Recording mode - having used JPG, then DNG+JPG, I gave up on all of that and now just set the camera to DNG. The images go into Lightroom on my computer, and it all works fine. Supposedly - not sure about this yet - but I bought one of the iPhone lightning-port to SD-card adapters, and I was told that with the latest operating system on my iPhone X, I can import the DNG images directly into the phone. Maybe tomorrow I will try that. More later - I feel like I'm just now discovering how wonderful a camera the M8.2 is. The M10 might be better, but that's $8,000 or so. I'm not convinced yet that the photos I take would be any better.

Found backfocus with a constant amount of turn of the focus ring to focus correctly, so I trusted I would be able to correct that. As suggested earlier in this thread that the cam could be polished is wrong when the lens backfocusses! The cam is too short, not too long. So, in very small steps I compressed the cam of the lens by tapping on it with a small hammer, using a flat headed pin (diameter 3 mm) exactly in the middle where it (when mounted) rests agains the rangefinder wheel of the camera. The other side of the cam was supported well with a steel flat object. This compression makes the cam a bit longer (just a few hundredth of a mm) and now the lens focusses exact throughout the range of focussing, from 1 meter to infinity. It took me about half an hour to correct it. It is not necessary to take the lens apart. There is enough room for the pin to reach the cam from the inside when the lens is set to infinity. The outside of the cam is supported by the steel flat object. the lens is supported with a bean bag for instance. So perhaps worthwhile for those who feel they have an overpriced paperweight. --img--  But beware: you need only light hammer taps to get the effect needed. If you did too much, you can file it off with a very fine diamond-powdered file, but when you take your time, that is not needed. Tap not quite at the edge of the cam, you want the edge to remain smooth, just about 2 or 3 mm away from the edge with the pin lightly resting on it. Here an example of how well it focusses, taken at f/1.1, focussed on the lips (square crop at full height taken with the M9, no post-processing): click (I dremel coded the lens as a Noctilux 1.0) The lens certainly is worth being corrected, because it is very sharp indeed. Ok - I know this is a very old post, however I have just made this adjustment using a 25mm socket as the 'anvil' (which exactly matched the radius of the focus cam) and a wide blade screwdriver as the 'punch' and with the lens suitably supported so all impact goes only into the focus cam/tab - with some very gentle tapping it brought the back focus forward to precise focus on my M10. Very happy with the results coming off the lens now and absolutely bang on all the way through the focus range.

I see absolutely no need for AF when shooting any of this kind of work, whether in the field or not, because all of it really requires a camera stand or tripod of some sort to achieve the level of quality I'm interested in.

I didn't do a great job at explaining the issue in my original post, let me try to clarify: For most settings the User Profiles will work as you'd expect, such as with the menu item in your example. However, there are some menu items that the User Profiles will simply ignore, such as Digital Zoom, Self-Timer and Display Settings. There may be more, but these are the ones I've found as they are of insterest to me. Settings under these menus cannot be successfully saved to a User Profile in my experience. You may have hit on the one thing that profiles don't override (at least in my experience). I think that when you turn on a Q, it defaults to the last display setting you had before you turned it off, regardless of which profile you choose. Maybe that's true of digital zoom as well, but I never use that. But, if I understand you correctly, your main concern is changing display settings. If so, why bother to create 2 profiles that just differ by that one variable? After all, going from one profile to the other just to change display setting doesn't save any more work than just having one profile and toggling the display setting. There definetly seems to be a few menu items that is ignored by the User Profiles. It's not an issue when turing on or off the camera, it's that the User Profiles completely ignore these settings and will never overwrite your current selection even though the profile was saved with a different one. Actually, if you program the FN key to select User Profiles, it is quite a bit faster then going into the menu. All you need then is either 3 or 4 quick presses to change between the two profiles, which I find a whole lot easier and more convenient then going into the menu: FN > RIGHT > OK for User Profile 1, or FN > RIGHT > RIGHT > OK for User Profile 2. My whole idea with this was to try to replicate what I'm used to work with, which is a dedicated button to turn on/off live view. That said, as it turned out it is not possible to do it the way I want so I just have to work around it.

After years of optically testing lenses and camera AF systems (due to specific and often demanding requirements of mine), I would not use a human, animal or any moving subject as a test target to determine a camera or lens's focusing accuracy. I would start with a series of say aluminum cans like soda or beer cans (don't drink the beer while testing or you are bound to have a lot of focusing anomalies --img--  ). Stagger them out in a straight line at a 45 degree angle with fairly close spacing of the cans. There are of course lens align tools to determine mis focusing to make things easier. for a camera or lens to misfocus, generally means it front or back focuses or the Af sensor in the given camera is too broad and doesn't always accurately pic of the precise spot you focused on. The Leica S often has had the exact same issue you have noticed in your XV. My comments are generalities to testing and beyond this initial test I described, it's then important to determine how precise the camera's sensor is in its coverage of the test target or does it more broadly cover a greater area. Often times the sensor is not aligned with the viewfinders green box's location. Leica has often found S cameras that were sent in for Af errors, well within spec and returned such cameras, only to have the user continue to have Af errors. It's apparent all of these Leica cameras are unlike the Nikon/Cannon type cameras we are used to, af wise and knowing the parameters to get proper focus, is the key to its success. As I mentioned in your thread of your review of the X Vario, I more often use the camera in af mode and have been pleasantly surprised regarding its accuracy.

Looks like, if you're saving up for a decent pocketable camera that doesn't sacrifice picture quality, you might possibly be looking at a used Q instead. In the CL/DL7 price range there's little to choose between them. Personally I'd probably for the Q route. As to price: Listen, I started on M2, M3, M4 and had to sell them all cause I couldn't afford to keep them. Then later on it was the D-Luxes to the V-Lux (my partner saw that one arrive and said 'mine' - she's shot four photo books and still uses it almost every day), then the M9, M10, and all sold now, because I still can't afford to keep one without working it full-time. The moral of this story? Well I bought all of those Leicas used - and didn't lose a cent on any one of them. In fact I might have made a hundred or two along the way. Like any digital camera, the used prices settles down after awhile, as a percentage of the new price, around 50-75% of it, typically. I've found that even over a period of years, the Leicas, after that initial slump in price, have retained their resale value a lot more than, say, their Panasonic equivalents. So yes, I've also found that the more expensive Leicas shoot better photos (maybe because I felt better shooting with them), and so tend to be more desirable, and their resale value therefore higher. I think I Q would hold its used value better than either the C-Lux or the DL-whatever-number-you-want. Again most probably because of branding - there's no Panasonic version of the Q, is there? - but also because IMO it looks and feels more like a classic M than the Lux models. So save the money and get the best you can afford. In the case of the red dot camera, that's one thing you know you'll be able to get your money back on, if and when you decide to move on or up. And in the meantime, there's all those legendary shots you've taken, with that cool (and expensive) camera. But in the end, you see, I might not have a Leica at the moment, but I've shot more than a dozen models over the decades. When next I need one, I'll get one.

I have not had a single problem after getting the AF upgrade on mine. I think the anger is mainly because with this level of failure, the market price for Leica S has become quite bad, meaning escaping from this system is a huge financial loss, and if you decide to be loyal and stick to it, or unable and unwilling to take the loss, you ran the risk of the system went discontinue due to bad reputation and low interest, which at current climate, it is highly likely. And if Leica S is discontinued in the next 2 years or so, you will end up with a dead system with 30~40k USD invested. Sure, you can still use it, but you know it's not going to be able to compete with other offering on the market. You can't expect the S to be treated like an M, I think we are more tolerant to the M and accept M for what it is. Technology develops and if S is unlucky to get the boot, then the loyal S users will be left with an outdated body that will not be updated, and a bunch of good lens they can't adapt to other camera system (not like the R) as the coding for Leica S is locked (easily fix if Leica decide to make it public). Leica will probably make the SL to have more resolution and make that as the S-lens body and stop doing S all together to appease the old S users with 5~ lens in the dry box....

Thank you for this know-how. How do you find color-casting with the LF lenses? I have only read things online, so my knowledge is mostly second hand and so not worth a lot, but I understand that we have to be careful with lens selection (for casts) too when capturing with a digital back, especially an adapted digital camera body. Re: shutter shock, the one thing I have in my favor, for this application, is that I'm shooting in the studio and ambient light is not a factor for almost all of the shots I'm doing; I could probably be at 1/30 and still have no ambient exposure. My lights have good-enough t.5 times, so my \"strobe-shutter\" should be quick enough to knock out most vibration-related blurring, i.e., the focal plane shutter, effectively, has no influence on my shots. I haven't had a problem with the S so far in this respect (I use an S2-P and S typ006). There's decent chance I'll want to drag the shutter and bleed a lot of ambient in for some of the images I'd like to make for the more creative poster-work, but doing this on a 4x5 with the S as a digital back is only a hypothetical at this point, so not worth worrying about. The diffraction stuff was very helpful, Stuart, thank you. I haven't shot 1:1 enough to have practical-mastery over bellows effects and so on [my previous camera body was a Nikon, and Nikon tended to compensate for effective aperture with in-camera software, so the body would give a pretty good readout of what the effective aperture was]... and your info about lens selection was excellent: I have to thank you again. I see doing things this way as an opportunity to get some important photographic know-how down that I can use again and again. As I said, I am aiming toward using technical cameras day in and day out, so I want to, and as a matter of professional pride: need to, know the things you talked about inside out... I'll only get there by doing. (I began to dislike the user friendly automation in Nikons, etc., for work because they negated this opportunity to a degree; not a criticism of Nikon or making things easier for users, not at all... just a matter of preferences and ambitions. I came into photography late in my work-life and did not have the chance to apprentice to anyone or be taught the ropes; it is a disadvantage for me, in my opinion, and I have great respect for the craft and practical know-how that many professionals who did come up that route command. I want that high degree of craft and practical knowledge for myself too]. My first choice, which I'm hoping to get a rental organized for, is the HC 120-II that Yevgeny was using for his artwork repros. Both Hasselblad options sounded good to me, as my application requires 1:1 performance above all else, and both Hasselblad 120's offer that... I'll try the premo HC option first, assuming my rental works out, and depending how that goes, proceed from there. The S-adapter-C I'd found which kicked this exploration off, disappeared in the interim, but that route, as an option, is still alive and well in my mind. I'm not rolling in money, so have to patiently watch for used equipment to come up and take my chances, or not, at those times that it does. So it could still be the Contax, in the end, for me. But I did learn one thing over the years: don't waste money on \"cheaper\" or \"here now!\" options just because they came up... I've found I usually ended up regretting the impatience and then paying, literally, twice for the mistake. So I've learned the hard way to get as much intel as I can, play it through in my head a bit, listen to my gut, listen to my heart too, of course, but above all else, if I'm going to buy something: it has to be 100% commit, and assume I am never going to sell it again. Or don't go there. Most of all: wait! (and the more you wait, the better prices usually get too). You never know until you know, we all know, but there's no harm being conservative when it comes to thousands of quid I'm happiest, at the moment, that the HC 120-II would be good for me, so looking forward to (fingers crossed) trying it. I have a ton of other things to think about and try though, thanks to all of the advice here; yours of course, Stuart. Have a good weekend.

It would take more than a rebate to make me want the Fuji; I find it awkwardly designed with buttons on every available surface, slow to operate, and with a poor viewfinder. Someone who practices a different type photography may find it entirely acceptable. My initial thought when I saw the Hasselblad X1-D, and the corresponding Fuji, was that they were going for the Sony A7R market. That's smart, there are quite a few photographers who are frustrated by the high-megapixel Sony, and who are ready to spend a bit more to improve their ratio of \"keepers.\" Photographer who upgrade from the Sony to either of these mirrorless cameras will find that the quality of their images, and the ease of achieving that quality, has improved tremendously. The improvement will be much greater than the small increase in megapixels suggests. That's an entirely different market from the Leica S.

Best, David I agree with you that upgrading to the 007 vastly expands the shooting enveloppe. I have used the 006 but was given a 007 loaner by Leica during 006 maintenance in Wetzlar. A poisoned gift it would seem First thing I did afterwards was to buy a 007. Personally, I find the colors produced by the 007 more to my likening (without any further processing). The camera acts faster, and is more refined, than the 006 in most respects. The major bonus is the higher ISO, which allows using the camera under conditions that would not have been possible with an 006 - as you have discovered yourself. The 006 is IMHO more of a studio camera, when conditions are set up and controlled. The 007 can face most, if not any, type of photography. As such, it is more mainstream in actual practice.

It has been a wonderful ride. I have made the best pictures of my life with this box and still marvel at the files when they appear on my computer screen. The same feeling I get, in an analog way, when I put those MF/LF chromes on a light box and examine with a loop. Coming from my equally beloved M9, I knew the look and the limitations. And I made work around for low light shooting, to the extent possible: wide open, low ISO, underexpose and push in post processing. Strategically, I am mostly a model behind so as to take advantage of the market, and Leica's practice of offering incentives to move out the old to make room for the new. Got my M9 and S this way. When responding to posts from vacillating purchasers on the cusp of a decision, I typically suggest that they assess their perceived need and then determine if the putting the mazoola on the mahogany just scratches an itch or expands the creative envelope. I find myself in that same place now. Yesterday, thanks to a note from Rob, I pulled the trigger on a new S 007. Popflash had it for just under $8700. I suspect it is a \"Q\"\" version, though I cannot tell until I see the box. Got my M9 and Q this way. When I got up yesterday, I did not go in search off a new camera, let alone a new S. To be sure, this was not a ready, shoot, aim purchase. I have been thinking about this move for a while. But I did not have the luxury of indulging in the purchasing foreplay and consternation that is so titillating. The opportunity presented, itself, and that was that. And a day later, I harbor no regrets. But as the dopamine subsides, I wonder if I have followed the advice that I so freely dispense to others. Particularly with this purchase, which is the most nuanced for sure. My M9 was my introduction to Leica, save for that time more than 40 years before when I traveled Europe as a young man with my dear uncle's IIIc (which has since come into my hands again). It was a revelation. M lenses followed. As a shooter of MF and LF film, I had certain expectations that were not and could not be met by the M9, as good as it is. And my eyesight often stood between me and the image I wanted. So I moved up to the S006, and remain thrilled with the output. The quality of MF with the CCD look of the M9. Brilliant. But I still faced the shortcomings of the CCD sensor, especially in low light or any situation where the right balance of limited ISO, shutter speed and aperture opening just could not get me the creative flexibility I needed. And many of my images have the same DOF composition because of it. The S 006 is the perfect camera for perfect conditions. But perfection is rare. So I sprung for a Q earlier this year for a trip to Thailand. My vampire camera, I call it. It remained sheathed in daylight and came out only at night or in dark temples or other venues. And it is brilliant in that respect. A very unique, if not specialized, tool given its fixed lens. But as I saw what the Q could do, I pined for a love child created between the Q and the S, especially with low light features. Read lots here on the 007, and elsewhere. Saw David Farkas' quite remarkable blog post of his shooting excursion one evening with the 007. And I wondered if the 007 is that love child. I shoot horses, with a camera, of course. And typically in dimly lit barns, or in the evening. I am particularly drawn to horse pulling events at county fairs here in Maine. These gentile, giant beasts are magnificent canvases of shiny hide drenched in sweat, muscle and vascularity, and no more so than after a pulling event and illuminated by diffused barn light. I shot the Blue Hill fair last evening, after I pulled the trigger on the 007. And I wondered how the experience would be different with that camera. How much more could it have reached into the darkness. How much faster could I shoot and isolate movement. How greater a DOF could I get with razor thin MF lenses, and could I have dispensed with the tripod until sometime later. Would my keeper percentage increase with the benefit of live viewing focus.

David 1.Setup- customize control-AF/AE lock button-in MF mode=AFs On (you can choose AFc On as well) 2, if you already setup focus peaking in your CAPTURE ASSISTANT, during LV, you just hit any button around your LCD and cycling 'i' button, you will see peaking. 3. Again, in CAPTURE ASSISTANT, disable manual focus assist. It will no longer magnify if you accidentally touch focus ring. 4. Rang will light up when you light touch shutter. However, it is not that useful. as I found it is not reliable. I will not use it. 5. There is no difference in terms of AF accuracy between 006 and 007. 007 seems faster, but not that useful in field as most of time it is just hunting more that move faster back and forth. Dynamic range and low light capability are very real. It will make the system more versatile and can handle wider range of shooting. However, as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't have the magic file of 006 has for portrait, and I prefer S006 color IMHO.

They are useful to have, but there is no comparison to a good OVF, whether a rangefinder or SLR. I shoot a lot at night, and while a camera like the A7S can make the scene appear brighter, it comes at two great costs -- an increasingly noisy viewfinder as it gets darker and darker, largely becoming useless in truly dark conditions, and more problematically, it completely destroys your night vision every time you look in the viewfinder. I actually find it easier to shoot a 4x5 camera with an f/5.6 lens at night than an EVF camera, because as long as you have a good flashlight or something visible to focus on, it is easier to do so than to constantly be blinding yourself with the screen lights. The S works impressively well at night, as the AF system is sensitive enough to focus on a bright star or the moon, and if you turn down the screen brightness it is low enough not be too bad for your night vision.

I hope this will shed some light on the cleaning process. Having your sensor cleaned by the manufacturer or by a repair technician is a costly and needless expense and inconvenience; it is something that every photographer would benefit from learning to do themselves. If you are on a month long photo expedition in _______________ (fill in the blank) and your sensor picks up debris on your first lens change, do you really want to come home with 20,000 images that must ALL be spotted in Photoshop or Lightroom? Digital Camera Sensor Cleaning Digital cameras have sensors; unless your camera has a built in dust reduction system, sooner or later your sensor will need to be cleaned - it's inevitable. Then what?? It's a lot quicker, easier and less costly to do it yourself - if you follow your camera manual instructions exactly and are careful, you can successfully clean your camera's sensor yourself. A lot of photographers fear damaging their sensor and will do about anything to avoid cleaning it themselves. However, there is no reason to be afraid to do this procedure yourself, provided you do it properly. You will need the right sensor cleaning supplies - I use Eclipse Optic Cleaning Fluid and Photosol Sensorswab Ultra sensor cleaning swabs. If your camera has a full frame (24x36mm ) sensor, you will need the Type 3 swabs; they are 24 mm wide, as is your sensor. APS-C and smaller sensors will need smaller swabs. Photosol's website has information that will help you determine which swab is right for your camera. One of the most important factors in successful sensor cleaning is to perform this procedure in a clean, dust free environment. Not many of us have access to a clean room such as computer manufacturers build computers in. If your home has airborne dust issues you will need to clean your sensor in an environment where dust is less of a problem (you can check for airborne dust by looking through the beam of a bright flashlight at night; if you see a lot of dust particles dancing in the air, you should probably go elsewhere to clean your sensor). Where would that be? Try a museum or a library; find a spot away from frequent foot traffic, entries and exits and away from heating and cooling ducts that will cause airflow that will stir up any dust that may be present. Another important point is this - do not use compressed air (\"canned air\") to blow dust from your sensor before cleaning. Canned air can spray liquid propellant onto your sensor cover glass, something you do not want to happen. That liquid can also get behind the sensor and into the electronic components of your camera. If that happens, you are in for a serious repair bill. Instead of canned air, use a blower bulb like the Giottos Rocket Blaster, which will safely remove loose dust particles from your sensor. The sensor swabs I use are dry, which means I need to apply the proper cleaning fluid to them before use. Too much cleaning fluid can damage the electronics inside your camera, so proceed with caution. I have found that four drops on the 24mm wide swabs my camera requires is sufficient (two drops on one side, two on the opposite side) applied right at the edge of the swab that will contact your sensor; give them 10 seconds to be wicked across the swab's edge so that the liquid is dispersed in a uniform manner. Again, follow the directions that come with your swabs and cleaning fluid to the letter. Each camera has a specific procedure for sensor cleaning; if you precisely adhere to the instructions in your camera manual, you should have a successful sensor cleaning result. If there are still spots on your sensor after cleaning, you can re-clean the sensor provided your camera manual does not advise against doing so (I once ended up with an eyelash on my sensor that required two cleanings to remove; the first try simply moved it closer to the center of the sensor; this happens sometimes). If you follow the directions in your camera manual and in your swab and cleaning fluid to the letter, you should have no problems cleaning your sensor at home (or at your local museum or library, if need be). DISCLAIMER The above description of sensor cleaning is simply a description of how I clean my sensor; it is not intended as training or professional advice in sensor cleaning. Always follow the directions in your camera manual and in your sensor cleaning materials to the letter. When in doubt, contact your camera manufacturer for advice on sensor cleaning, or return your camera to the manufacturer's repair department for sensor cleaning.

I think 4x5 has the edge on fine detail in certain circumstances, but the S seems smoother in other circumstances since digital at base ISO has no grain to speak of. When I shoot black and white, I often add film grain to the S files so that they blend with the 4x5 (in this context, I think the grain is a net positive for film). I think the 4x5 images often have more presence, which is something to do with the tonality and focal length. But I can understand that people shooting 100mp might disagree. I think the S with 100mp would surpass 4x5 in all practical senses, though of course not offering the possibility of darkroom printing or camera movements. Overall with some care, they blend together quite well, even in large prints. To be honest, however, if you know what you are doing the capture device is usually not the source of limitation...which is not to say it is unimportant. I use MF and large format because I like working with them and appreciate the flexibility they give me as well as the qualities they have in prints (sometimes very large prints). That said, I am making a book where S and 4x5 images are used alongside images that are made using a drone, and even one which I took through a pair of binoculars using an iphone se.

I look forward to seeing and reading about the recreation of your working UR replica #2.I am sure there will be several customers for it --img--  . The old Leitz lens intrigues me, especially considering its fine results in your camera. In the 1900-1920 era, were lens elements hand-ground, or were there machines that ground many at a time? Pictures (and movies?) of the old lens making procedures would be interesting as part of this thread. I wonder what materials the Leica factory has, that show these very old techniques? I thank you for the compliment. I will think of your words when in the process of making the second UR camera. we are challenged and frustrated as everything to make it work requires specially handcrafted parts made to exacting tolerances. I also appreciate your asking the question about the lens manufacturing process. There may be pictures of the lens grinding process at Leitz but i have never seen them. Also industries are not want to share how they do special manufacturing processes. I know as at one time I worked as a senior research engineer for a manufacturing company. You must also understand that by the time Oscar Barnack designed the UR Leica, the Leitz company had been making camera and microscope lenses for over one half a century. The most challenging lenses to manufacture are not the camera lenses, it is the microscope lenses. These are exceedingly small lenses with small radii of curvature, that must be precisely ground and installed into the tiny objective part of the microscope. I am sure that the grinding of the lens was done on automatic machines watched very carefully by production mechanics. It is a process that starts with designing the lens on paper, choosing the correct refractive indices of the glass for each lens element, grinding on rotating plates on which finer and finer grits are placed until you have the finished grinding of the shape and polish on the lens surface. As a geochemist I have gone through a similar process when I made thin sections of rock samples. The perfect rock sample thickness is that immediately before all the sample disappears into the grit and you only have the glass slide upon which the rock sample was glued. Of course this is a much different process than that used to make a lens but it is an example of how important timing is in the grinding process. A few seconds is the difference between a perfect lens and a throw away one.

Questions on phase 1 (for Ray or others): A Leica take up spool will fit into take up area diameter-wise, but not depth-wise. The problem is there is a large headed screw at the bottom when looking down into camera that looks like I have to remove it. Correct? See pics below. This screw holds the ratchet that prevents winding in the wrong direction, but since there is an arrow on the top dial, I may not need the ratchet. Seems the film gate is narrow enough that the film tension through the gate will prevent film from winding itself backwards accidently. --img--  --img--  I have an extra take up spool on order for the supply side. Ray's previous instructions said trim it down to 25mm diameter, but a regular spool is already less than that, so will trim until it fits. Or I could just put loose film in supply side too unless that causes problems. I have on order some square phonograph drive belts as Ray recommended. Hopefully will be the right size, they were the smallest diameter I could find around 1\" diameter per Ray's recommendation. I assume I connect this to the bottom of the sprocket (when looking down into the open camera) and the bottom of where the take up spool attaches? Do I have to make it a figure 8 to match the way a normal Leica winds? Or will it work better with less tension if I don't figure 8 it? Will the latter not put enough tension of the film against the sprocket to move film forward smoothly? For step 2, I assume the dummy lens comes out by removing the three small screws around the rim of the lens? Take them all the way out or just partially? Need to do anything with the screw on the aperture adjustment? Do I use the aperture in the dummy versus aperture that comes with the lens? --img--  Will need significant help on phase 3, the shutter curtain. The dummy curtain spool is set back too far forward of the film gate, on left side of pic below, so just putting a new curtain on the existing spools will leak light like crazy. --img--  Thanks in advance for any advice and help!

Been busy at work so it's been slow. As I last posted, I had broken the spring on the roller that provides tension for the shutter.

Here's the broken original roller (left) next to the donor roller. --img--  I took the spring roller from the donor camera and use a Dremel tool to cut the shaft to the precise length I needed to fit in the Ur Leica. Then per Ambro51's advice, stuck the shaft into the chuck of my drill to turn it into a makeshift lathe. With the shaft spinning in the drill, I applied pressure to the last 2mm of the shaft with a fine grained file and was able to reduce the diameter of that portion of the shaft to be small enough to fit into the hole at the top of the camera as the original did. The top of the donor shaft was left hand threaded and larger in diameter than the right hand threads of the original shaft, so it wouldn't nicely screw in the bracket that holds it. I drilled out the hole in the bracket to be slightly smaller than the donor shaft threads, then bought a cheap tap wrench from Amazon and found a cheap left handed 2.5mm tap on eBay and tapped the left handed threads into the hole. This is now working fine. --img--  The last step will be to install that assembly in the camera and wind the roller enough to provide the correct tension to release the shutter but not enough to break it like the original.

This certainly shows that Leica varied its lens output quite a bit over short periods of time. One of the reasons for some of the variations above was the short 'shelf life' of the Agfa Colour system.

As the tech gets increasingly homogenised, there is little major difference in pictorial out put between major brands. Yes one has personal preferences I do for Leica but I understand this is my personal/emotional choice, I shoot with a lot of cameras and note that my images are boringly similar regardless of the camera I use. Many will respond with assorted flavours of 'the only way you will get me to give up my Leica is to prize it from cold dead hands', but this is emotional, religious, personnel preference, and ignores the macro economic forces affecting any model in a market. Which in this case is that for major brand facing constant technical change then the subscription model has an appeal, as it is a more formal way of locking you into the brand. After all as lenses become more interchangeable across mirrorless platforms, it becomes easier to swap platforms. Leica SL to Sony A7 to Z7 or what ever.

As my interest in photography grew and I became more acquainted with the masters of humanitarian documentary, the name came up again and again, which compounded the mystique. When I finally started thinking seriously about replacing my aging crop-frame Canon 350D, in 2009 there was a screaming hype online about the idea of a full frame digital Leica. I didn't want to go back to shooting film and didn't want to buy a crop frame camera, but there seemed to be a debate raging about whether a full frame M was even physically possible (this was before the advent of micro-lenses). When the M9 was released was star-struck and determined to get one, but it was way out of reach, financially. Months later, I became friends with a new guy at work who seemed to share every interest of mine, including photography. When the conversation finally came around to Leica and I talked about how I was desperate to try one he said, \"Oh, I have an M6. I'll lend it to you for a few months.\" Three months with the M6TTL and 50 Lux sealed the love affair, although with inconsistent results. I talked about it constantly at home, to my wife's chagrin \u2014 \"We can't afford a camera that costs thousands of dollars!\" \"I don't need to afford it!\" I said, \"I just need to find a way of getting one!\" I'd managed to barter my way into a custom bicycle in the past by exchanging design work for labor and figured there must be a similar avenue with the Leica. The guy at work had put down a deposit on an M9 and told me that he would be willing to sell me the M6 cheaply on condition that I lend it back to him if he missed shooting film. One day while chewing the ear off another friend about Leica, he told me he thought the brand had become pretentious \u2014 \"It's just a very simple camera with luxury marketing. And the simpler it gets the more pretentious the claims are. They should make a pinhole camera, charge a fortune and market it as the most essential camera there is.\" That's it! I designed a little cardboard pinhole camera with a rectangular enclosure, and stole product photography from Leica's own website to map onto the box. With a small amount of money borrowed from a friend, I funded a print run of Leica-look-alke pinhole templates on heavy cardboard, scored along the fold lines, with instructions and a Sunny 16 exposure guide included. I designed and built a small website in the style of the leica-camera.com of the day, with a satirical \"Like-a\" red dot logo, and the most pretentious product copy I could come up with, connected to an ecommerce order form. At $20 each for a sheet of cardboard they were hand-crafted and approaching Veblen margins. With some creative Tweeting and some help from a few friends I managed to get picked up by the WIRED blog and a few others, and the orders started coming in. Much like the real Leica, some hated the idea of paying so much for so little, but many loved the idea and bought two or three for old friends who were Leicaphiles, or to add to a collection of other Leica paraphernalia. Eventually, I received a stern letter from Leica AG, scalding me for appropriating their logo and ordering a cease and desist. I complied of course, and told their Legal department that it was only a desire to buy one of their products that lead to all this. I tallied up the takings and was close enough to make an offer on the M6 and 35 Cron. I shot that camera and lens at the exclusion of all else for two or three years and found it punishing. The first three months produced the worst pictures I've ever taken. Out of focus, under exposed, just generally crap. But as each month went by I learned the camera intuitively and the pictures got better. When the Typ 240 was released, the same friend upgraded again, and I traded him back the M6 and some cash in exchange for the M9. I loved the M9, but it eventually succumbed to the sensor corrosion issue and when Leica offered an M or M-P upgrade I jumped to the M-P. The M10 is tempting, but I'll hold off for at least another generation (unless maybe there's an M10-P or Safari that's just too good to pass up).

In the Spring 2003 semester, I signed on to direct a semester long study abroad program in Salamanca, Spain. Having used a variety of cameras since I was a kid \u2014from Kodak Instamatic 110s to various Polaroid cameras to a plastic toy camera that I painted and carried off with me when I moved to Mexico City for a year in 1988, to my first \"real\" camera, a Canon EOS 650 that I bought upon returning from Mexico City\u2014 I was interested in buying a new camera for my trip. I had a film SLR, but I wanted something lighter and digital. I had a Canon PowerShot, but I was never pleased with the images. In my search, I came upon the Leica Digilux 1. I knew the brand, of course, as I always had at the back of my mind a dream of having an M. But I couldn't afford an M. I was, however, able to find a Digilux 1 at a good price. And so, in December, 2002, I made the leap. The first pics from that camera? I was terribly disappointed. I almost left it behind and was resigned to taking the PowerShot. But I didn't. And when I got to Spain, the more I used the Digilux 1, the more I liked it. I liked the boxy design, no, I love it. it was different, and somehow retro, I thought it was great. Sure, the resolution wasn't much, and sometimes the low light pics were noisy, but I grew to love it for its quirks. But I still had the dream of a film Leica. A few months into my life in Salamanca, I had to travel to London for a quick trip. While walking around, taking pics with my Digilux 1, I passed a camera shop that carried Leica products. I popped in to see what Used offerings were on hand, and while I really wanted a used M6 I looked at, I couldn't afford it. Instead, I got a Leica CL, with a 40mm lens. It was my first rangefinder and I was taken. It was a perfect size, pocketable and light. My first pics were not good, I had to figure out how to use a manual camera again, after more than a decade of auto-everything. But I got the hang of it. Sort of. I think I would have gotten better with it had I not been perusing another camera shop in Barcelona a few months later. It was an M6 that got me. It was in bad shape, clearly used a lot, but it worked. I traded in my CL for the M6 and went to town. In November, 2003, about four months after having the M6, I purchased in NYC my first new Leica, an M7. I tried to trade in my M6, but B&H wouldn't take it because of the shape it was in. It didn't matter, I was later able to trade it in towards an Epson R-D1 (my first digital rangefinder) in Barcelona in 2005.

I told him I'd like to make and offer, but I couldn't give him what the camera was actually worth because I had to many other expenses. He said : go ahead and make an offer, you never know.

No matter how I cut it, the bodies are too bulky to want to carry nowadays. I ride a bicycle most of the time now and am always looking for a smaller camera which makes the same image quality. I also prefer interchangeable lens cameras, which puts the Q off the table completely. So I'd go with an M, but not the M9. The M9 I was always ambivalent about: not responsive enough and the JPEG rendering in-camera was not appealing to me. I swapped it for the M-P typ 240 when the M9 showed up with the sensor problems and was much happier, but I swapped that for the M-D typ 262 and have been delighted ever since. If I were buying today, and wanted a single camera to do occasional macro/tabletop/long lens work as well, I'd buy an M typ 240 or the latest M10 for the Live View feature so I could use my R system macro setup (which I currently use with a CL). In fact, with that thought in mind, if I wanted just one camera to eliminate the DSLR and do everything with, I'd pick a CL over the Q or the M. The CL body is M size but 200g lighter, the T/TL lenses are outstanding and give you all the features (AF, all exposure modes, etc), and the Leica adapters for M and R lenses give you complete access to all the M and R lenses should you so desire it. The smaller format is not a concern: just jump down one focal length and open up one stop compared to the FF bodies and you'll only rarely if ever run into any limitations based on format. I love my M very much, but in practical terms the CL is really the most versatile, best performing light, small camera around.

Moderators please feel free to move it to the appropriate location. I am in a quandry and hopefully someone here has had the same issue. I currently possess nothing longer than a 50mm and want to get a 90mm for portraiture and the like. I use a MP-240, M 246 and recently a SL. All of my lenses are M lenses. The recent acquisition of a SL has opened up the possibilities of a SL AF lens. Without the SL i would not hesitate to get a used M90mm APO Summicron. The M version makes sense in allowing me to use both M and SL bodies. The SL lens allows me to use AF (which could be welcome but not 100% essential) but is limited to SL use and is much bigger than the M version. Reviews i have read say the SL version is even sharper than the M Apo version. So which to get? I know many will ask me which bodies I use more but since my SL is only a week old, i couldn\u2019t honestly say although the SL EVF makes life a lot easier. May be i should make it even easier and get the SL lens but my original raison d\u2019\u00eatre for moving to Leica was the compactness. An SL with a M lens just about falls into that category, a SL with SL lens, not so much...

I went back and looked at the S006 photos I'd taken a couple of year earlier and they were still very beautiful. I felt much less excited by the X1D photos. A few firmware quirks also bugged me.

Yes of course. That was my subjective judgement based on the work I do. Since you wrote that, FW changes have improved performance, including blackout duration, although it\u2019s still there. Yes, the review is quite old now and I\u2019m aware of the updates. However, at the time I don\u2019t think it would have changed my opinion. IN the end the point I was making is that I preferred the images from the 006. At the end of the review you comment on digital \u2018medium format\u2019 sensor size, and incorrectly state that both the S and X1D are 45x30 mm. Yes, I addressed the error in the comments. I\u2019m not a professional reviewer, I guess i should have gone back and updated the post. I only posted it as a point of reference for someone in the same position as I was. I found the AF seemed to be \u201coff\u201d on my 006. It could rarely nail focus and I\u2019m used to manual focusing anyway from the M and my moving image work. MF is faster and more natural for me. And once you\u2019ve had facial recognition based AF it\u2019s hard to go back to single point often wrong AF. but found it too limiting for handholding in other than good lighting conditions. And the split prism finder half blacked out at the slower end. The faster primes would likely have served better. Trade offs. Jeff I guess that\u2019s where my comment about ISO comes from. Yes it does shoot well past 400 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s useable. Add a zoom to that and it becomes a pretty difficult candid camera, which is what I\u2019m trying to do.

My main camera is base ISO800 and shooting at regular movie rates means the shutter speed is 1/48th of a second (in terms of lighting levels) so it\u2019s right on the edge of useable at ISO 400 for me with the S. On the M-E, which I think looks its best at ISO800 it\u2019s great, but at 400 on the S with mirror slap i get a few misses with motion blur.

If the scanner does not permit adjustment of exposure time / LED brightness, there is nothing you can do to get a better dynamics than what the scanner delivers. Of course you can spread the existing grey levels between 0 and 255, but that only increases to contrast. What do you mean with \"starting with a low contrast scan\" if you cannot change the scanners exposure???? Most scanners automatically adjust exposure time, to achieve whatever brightness you ask for in the controls. At least any decent scanner. Sometimes you can even hear the difference, with an extra dense original: stepstepstepstepstep becomes step-step-step-step-step as the scanner leaves the scanner CCD bar under each \"strip\" of the film for a longer exposure time. With a very rapid scanner, the steps are not as distinguishable, but the total scan times for a dense or thin original can be compared - 30 secs for a perfect \"normal\" slide or neg, vs. 25 secs for a thin original, and 40 secs for a dense original. With some of my old dense negs, my Nikon, that scans a normal 35mm image in 30 secs. or so, can take up to 90 secs to allow time to \"penetrate\" the film's density. Additionally, contrast comes from \"curves\" applied to the raw scan data, not exposure. A scanner will have a default curve that it can vary based on original image density and contrast, but can also be varied by user inputs. Vuescan has curve controls, although they are not as \"intuitive\" as, say, Adobe's, where one can just grab (many) points on the curve and drag them around. In Vuescan, you have to adjust the output at the 25% and 75% points on the brightness scale, by numerical entries (e.g. set default 75% to \"65%\"), and move just those two points or values left or right to set a \"curve\" that connects 0%, the two adjustable points, and 100%, with various \"S\" or \"U\" or \"C\" shapes. Or leave it \"linear\" - a straight line - output is 1:1 with input. _________________ My own scanning technique is this (Vuescan on a film-capable flatbed). Based on the wonderful fact that Vuescan can output .dng files. Processing the .DNG as a \"raw\" file in ACR is so much more flexible and easy and \"visual\" than most scanner adjustments. - I use Vuescan's \"autolevels\" exposure mode, with clipping set to zero. Default \"linear\" Vuescan curve. Output as 16-bit RGB .DNG from a \"B&W negative.\" - I scan 6x6 negs with the black border included, and adjust \"exposure\" manually to give me as close to a pure black (\"0,0,0\") as possible in the blank areas outside the image area (film base plus fog). That can be anywhere from exposure 0.60 to exposure 1.00, depending on film type/base density/fog. But most of the time is just left at 0.7 or so. (I mostly stick with TMax 400/100 and HC-110 - very little variation in base/fog density from roll to roll.) I ignore the white brightness point, at this stage. So long as it doesn't clip (and it doesn't, with negs), anything is fine. - For color negs, I will also adjust the separate RGB exposures to get as close to a \"correct, gray is gray\" color balance - my scanner tends to make the raw image blue/cyan, so my final adjustment is often about red 1.00, green 0.90, blue 0.67. - That gives me a scan with a \"full\" tonal range - everything in the actual film gets recorded with a tonal value or values other than zero or 255 (unless I blew the exposure/development and have \"blank\" shadows somewhere. --img-- - Those are the only scanning adjustments I make - I do all other adjustments with Adobe Camera Raw, just as with any \"raw\" .DNG. - Set blacks to just start to clip into the darkest parts of the actual image (the black borders go black long before that, if my camera exposure was correct).

(i mostly stick with tmax 400/100 and hc-110 - very little variation in base/fog density from roll to roll.) i ignore the white brightness point, at this stage. so long as it doesn't clip (and it doesn't, with negs), anything is fine. - for color negs, i will also adjust the separate rgb exposures to get as close to a \"correct, gray is gray\" color balance - my scanner tends to make the raw image blue/cyan, so my final adjustment is often about red 1.00, green 0.90, blue 0.67. - that gives me a scan with a \"full\" tonal range - everything in the actual film gets recorded with a tonal value or values other than zero or 255 (unless i blew the exposure/development and have \"blank\" shadows somewhere. --img-- - those are the only scanning adjustments -----> i !!!  -----> make !!!  - -----> i !!!  do all other adjustments with adobe camera raw, just as with any \"raw\" .dng. - set blacks to just start to clip into the darkest parts of the actual image (the black borders go black long before that, if my camera exposure was correct). about 2% of the actual picture area showing as pure black, usually (foggy days, not so much). - then adjust \"exposure, shadows, highlights, whites, contrast, curves, etc.\" to get the picture i want. and wb, if a color picture. the steps look like this a - scan as first imported into adobe camera raw - option key held down to show the \"clipped\" blacks straight from the scanner. b - as in a, but with the acr blacks slider (w/ option/alt key held down) moved left to clip about 2% of the image blacks as well as the film base \"border\". c - as in b, but without the option/alt key held down (shows all default scanned tones, not just black clipping) d - after final adjustments in acr (pretty much like lr's controls), of whites, contrast, exposure, shadows, highlights, curves, etc. etc. --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 103753, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "carbon_dragon", "date": "2018-09-27 21:58:00", "content": "It looks good!

B&W prints on silver gelatin IMO always look better from B&W film photos especially when it comes to contrast, shadows, and grey tones. So far I was not able to simulate the same outcome with my Canon PIXMA-100 inkjet printer which is otherwise a very good one. Different story for color photos: I printed a few times from color negatives in my darkroom with the RA-4 process, but the outcome did not convince me that the result was too distinguishable from a good inkjet color print. Therefore I digitize my color slide and negative photos and make inkjet prints of selected files afterwards. To avoid any kind of grainy look, color slide film is the best option here. A special case is in my infrared photography which I do all digitally. I found that similar to my experience with B&W photos, darkroom prints turn out better. To accomplish this, I make 4x5\" inkjet-printed negatives from selected digital IR files (named digital negatives).

This shot was from the second batch I've ever developed. More/stronger inversions should increase contrast (and perhaps increase the grain a little).I usually invert quite energetically, following the standard pattern of continuous inversi\u00f3n for one minute then four to five inversions each minute thereafter. However, small variations in the inversion pattern have neve seemed to make much difference. Maybe you just need to develop the film for slightly more time or increase the exposure a fraction?And if you are not wet-printing, there is plenty of scope to adjust things in post-processing, particularly if the negatives look good before they are scanned... Thanks for the input on inversions. I plan to do some post-processing but wanted to show the shot before I do so I could get input on the raw shot. HP5+ is not a fine grain fim generally speaking. In my opinion a different agitation wouldn\u2019t bring any improvement for that. You can try another developer like Microphen as well, but do not expect any fine grain results. It\u2019s a wrong film for that Thanks. I'll stick with current film and chemistry for a while until I get the hang of things. I mainly posted the questions so I don't learn bad habits. If you had been printing the image with an enlarger you would have chosen a harder paper grade to print on if you wanted more contrast. Yes, it's true, decisions needed to be made in the 'good old days'. It's a shame Lightroom won't let you do something similar, like an 'Auto Contrast' button if you want your decisions automated, or a slider to adjust contrast. To me the negative looks fine in terms of 'fresh out of the scanner' contrast. All the tones are there and all that needs doing is to adjust them, if only. You are never going to get fine grain from HP5, in this image it looks normal considering. Thanks for your input. I appreciate knowing that you believe this shot is representative of what the film can do. Ummm.. My Lightroom has contrast, highlights, shadows, blacks, whites, clarity and dehaze sliders. Why can't it control contrast and tonal scales? I'll post a post-processed shot with some minor adjustments. After scanning a B&W negative (no matter which film), you often have to slightly add more contrast to the final digitized image. Sometimes level adjustments are also beneficial. Regarding grain, this one looks pretty good to me for an HP5+ 400 film photo - still a lot better than Tri-X IMO --img-- . For lower grain, you could use Xtol developer which is rich in sulfites suppressing more severe grain formation. If this is still too much, switch to FP4+ 125 film - one of my favorite B&W films so far. Thanks for believing the grain looks ok. Small differences in agitation don\u2019t matter. Just be consistent \u2013 that does matter. I agitate constantly for the first 30 or so seconds. I then agitate for 10 seconds every minute \u2013 this generally means 4 inversions. I usually tap the tank on the sink just in case there are any bubbles. I also don't fill that tank to the top - I want some room for the liquid to move. \u201cand made no adjustments\u201d \u2013 you have abandoned the most important tool you have in making a good picture. You need to assess from a creative perspective how the picture looks and what you want from it. In a conventional darkroom you would make a series of prints that would get you to your goal step by step \u2013 you can do the same electronically. A little more contrast should be easily achieved from any software. If your picture looks flat \u2013 fix it. \u201cmade no adjustments\u201d is like playing Mozart without tuning your violin.

It's my first time with HC110 and I had difficulty deciding what dilution to use to give at least 6ml per film (3 in the tank) but also give me a long development time (I would prefer longer than 7 mins). It's interesting what you say about different meters giving different readings. Another potential problem I have is my 4 thermometers, two of which are Patterson, disagree! I think I've run it through at 250 to ensure shadow detail thinking I can always darken things in post processing. Also, I've heard people saying they've settled on 320 as the true speed of TriX so I've been reluctant to shoot it faster than that. For example, if shooting sunny 16 and it's bright sunlight, should the shutter be set to 1/500 at f16, or 1/250? So I run the whole film at 250 and try to process accordingly. I take your point though. I'm starting a new film of Neopan 400 today so I think I will set the meter to 400 and see how it develops/scans.

I put the print in a fresh water bath so that I could examine it without it being covered in fixer, then put it immediately into the print washer that was filled with fresh water. I washed the print for 5 minutes, then put it immediately into the wash aid for 10 minutes. I then put it back into the print washer (refilled with fresh water) for 20 minutes.

That reduced the problem a lot. Now I think I should get a more sophisticated filter, they must exist. Quite a difficult problem. I have also had this in a former workspace, but not often.

I live in a home built in the 1950s, although we did a complete remodel about five years ago and installed all new plumbing lines. Of course the area has fairly old infrastructure and who knows what the town plumbing lines that run to the house look like, so it's possible there are small fragments of something getting onto the prints. One thing I did try was reducing the temperature at which I was setting the press. I reduced it from 200 degrees to 150 degrees and doubled the time in the press to 4 mins. I did this with the last two prints I made and - interestingly - no pin holes. So perhaps I was exacerbating the problem with excessive heat which softened the emulsion too much. The prints aren't coming out of the press quite as flat as they were at the higher temperature, but putting them under some heavy books overnight seems to get them pretty close. I'll continue this for the next few prints I make and see if I just got lucky with the last couple or if this really has solved the problem.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/287089-pinhole-like-marks-in-fiber-prints/?tab=comments#comment-3565396", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "287089-pinhole-like-marks-in-fiber-prints", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "like you i flatten my prints, with a seal press (210) for up to 16x20 (40x50cm) and a b\u00fcscher press for 20x24 (50x60cm). i air dry my prints before pressing, by simply hanging them on lines . . . i print on ilford fiber warmtone. i have been printing and using dry mounting presses since 1980. last winter i had the same problem and like you i thought the problem was in the carton sandwich of the press. it wasn't, instead i found that i have tiny pieces of metal in the water. they're so small you can hardly see them. these pieces had attached to the emulsion. i found out by carefully feeling the surface of the prints with my fingers. then i began to check the water. in light colored trays these pieces were actually visible. obviously the problem was in my water system. i went to a hardware store and got a simple filter to install inside the tap. that reduced the problem a lot. now i think i should get a more sophisticated filter, they must exist. quite a difficult problem. i have also had this in a former workspace, but not often. both these spaces were / are quite old. now i have a space in a former hospital built in 30ties, a building with three floors. i am in the top floor. thanks for posting. i live in a home built in the 1950s, although we did a complete remodel about five years ago and installed all new plumbing lines. of course the area has fairly old infrastructure and who knows what the town plumbing lines that run to the house look like, so it's possible there are small fragments of something getting onto the prints. one thing i did try was reducing the temperature at which i was setting the press. i reduced it from 200 degrees to 150 degrees and doubled the time in the press to 4 mins. -----> i !!!  did this with the last two prints -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  and - interestingly - no pin holes. so perhaps i was exacerbating the problem with excessive heat which softened the emulsion too much. the prints aren't coming out of the press quite as flat as they were at the higher temperature, but putting them under some heavy books overnight seems to get them pretty close. i'll continue this for the next few prints i make and see if i just got lucky with the last couple or if this really has solved the problem.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105719, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Martin B", "date": "2018-07-26 14:38:00", "content": "Depends how the film was stored - if at room temperature or higher, add one stop additional development needs for every 10 years of expiration.

After having set up my existing enlargers for large format (4x5\") and small format negatives printing, I planned to use the 23C for medium format size negatives (6x7 cm) since I also had a Schneider-Kreuznach 80/5.6 enlarger lens. What I was missing is the fitting negative holder for 6x7 cm - I checked online and found a few horrendously expensive used negative holders (the new ones from Beseler were even more expensive). I checked in my clutter box where I kept other scavenged darkroom material, and I found an Omega-enlarger based 6x7 cm negative holder. Glad I didn't buy any of the overpriced Beseler ones - because actually the Omega one fits in portrait mode nicely into the 23C enlarger. Of course there is a little gap between closed upper bellow unit and the holder, but I found it is not an issue at all (no light leaks out to an extent that it would endanger the printing process during exposure). I didn't find it described online anywhere that Omega negative holders can be used in certain Beseler enlargers! The Schneider-Kreuznach 80/5.8 lens also handles the 6x7 cm negative size well with sharp corners when stopped down a bit (I normally use my enlarger lenses at f/11). Didn't find this information mentioned anywhere either - only posts online about the Nikkor 80/5.6 enlarger lens which is able to handle 6x7 cm negative size, too. Does anybody else made similar experiences and used parts of different enlarger types on another to make things work?

Not sure what you mean as \"speed loss\". The diluted amounts are quite normal in development processes and lead especially in the Xtol case to better highlight effects.

By dialing down your LCD brightness (in my case with a Mac Cinema display about 50% of full brightness), to edit pictures with daylight coming in the window onto the paper. And, where needed, by adjusting your ambient light on the paper (in your workspace) - open the window blinds, only work in daytime, add some really bright (ideally, daylight-balanced) room lighting for nightime editing/printing, etc. etc. That is the only way to get prints the same brightness as what you see on-screen - make sure you are viewing the picture both on the screen and the print with equal brightnesses. _____________________ As to color spaces, that applies only to the Working Space you choose in Lightroom - Adobe 1998 is the \"preferred\" colo(u)r space for LR or Photoshop and most other picture editing, unless you have a guaranteed reason to use something else. LR Preferences or some other menu item should let you change back from ProPhoto to Adobe 1998. Profiles are similar to - but not identical to - color spaces. So don't mix them up - they do different things. You should have a Profile for your computer screen, built either with Apple's built-in profiling software or with a third-party hardware device. For DIY with Apple's software, see: System Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate and go through the steps it asks for to set white point (yellower or bluer - default computer screens tend to be very blue), and gamma (a contrast curve) - and then save that profile with a name (\"Graeme's Profile Dec. 2018\" or some such). The default gamma setting is generally 2.2. The white point depends on various things, including how \"yellow\" your printing paper is. Usually somewhere between D5000 and D5500 K (degrees kelvin - a yellowish sunlight color). (BTW - I am selling $1000 worth of prints per month using the \"close to useless\" built-in Mac calibration software. And the prints match the screen exactly (despite the limitations of printing pigments vs. glowing screen pixels)). You should set up your Epson and LR printing controls/dialogue boxes so that 1) \"Printer Color Management\" is turned OFF (the printer sits down and shuts up, and lets LR have full control of the color data to print) and 2) then set up your LR printing preferences so that it can - in fact - accurately use that control. \"Lightroom Manages Color\" - ON. That includes choosing a Printer/Paper Profile (and there should be a ton of Epson paper profiles already installed - they came with your Epson P600 software): E.G. - \"SC P600 Series Premium Photo Paper Glossy.\" NB - for the most part, most photo inkjet papers (Luster, various Glossies, glossy Canvas) will work the same with that Premium Glossy profile. I mix-and-match Fiber Gloss, Premium Glossy, Premium Luster, from either Epson or Moab - and the prints all look the same. It is only if you are using matte papers that the profiles may get really different for each paper type and brand. (You can get third-party hardware/software to create your own paper profiles, but Epson's canned profiles are quite good. Other paper makers (Moab, Kodak, Hahnem\u00fchle, Ilford inkjet.....) usually have profiles for their own papers available online for free download.) And choosing a Rendering Intent - by default, \"Relative Colorimetric\" is preferred, with \"Perceptual\" as a secondary choice. Complex to explain the exact difference, which practically speaking is very little except with strongly-saturated colors. And turning on/off Black Point Compensation - usually ON is best to keep the shadows open and with maximum detail. My own settings for PhotoShop (LR's big brother) on a Mac Pro and Cinema display - Working Color Space: Adobe RGB 1998 - Display profile: custom-built with Apple's software, for gamma 2.2, white point D5400.

Not before nor now. I just access the whole thing from the front page [my bolding] I\u2019m also not sure what knowing the number of views really brings to the party, to be honest but they are still shown when not using filters or summary listings b @andybarton - Unless I'm doing something drastically wrong, which is entirely possible given the complexity of this BBS software, accessing the forum from the front page seems cumbersome, at lest from the point of view that there is no longer a button on each thread for going to the latest unread post \u2014 which means that, in practical terms, for long threads, one has to read from the end of a thread to try to find where one left off last time. Using the form in this way would seem to me to reduce participation because one has to spend more time doing this \u2014 and a reader is likely to do this only for the few topics in which he or she has an overwhelming interest. For me, that means that using routines or filters is essential for anyone interested in regular forum participation. As for the view count, I beg to differ, because I believe it can be an important and useful element in using LUF. One example, say you've started a thread and have only a few responses but see that there are a lot a views: you might get the thread moving by making a post to that effect. I've done that, and have seen other such \"reminder posts\" that get a thread moving with wider participation. The reverse is also true: if you see that your thread has little viewership then the game ain't worth the candle and you just give up on it. That was the case of my thread on the German TV series Babylon Berlin, which got so few views that it wasn't worth pursuing further, despite the fact that I thought that this series was one of the best thing on TV and also an important contribution to cinema. In either case, low or high view count can be useful to know \u2014 but having to go and track down the view count for one's thread in the basic forum view is too cumbersome to do regularly. I know the title of this thread, but feel it is useful to highlight the difficulties and frustrations in using LUF \u2014 and a certain that @LUF Admin would want to know this, considering that the new forum software is still in the shakedown stage, and critical adjustments and simple solutions such as issuing a Quick Guide, as well as suggestions I made earlier as well ones others have made, can lead to assuring greater and more effective user participation. _______________Alone in Bangkok essay on BURN MagazineNowhereman Instagram", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/290323-congratulation-for-the-new-site/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-3624426", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "290323-congratulation-for-the-new-site", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "18 hours ago, andybarton said: i have never used routines or filters to view the forum. not before nor now. i just access the whole thing from the front page [my bolding] i\u2019m also not sure what knowing the number of views really brings to the party, to be honest but they are still shown when not using filters or summary listings b @andybarton - unless i'm doing something drastically wrong, which is entirely possible given the complexity of this bbs software, accessing the forum from the front page seems cumbersome, at lest from the point of view that there is no longer a button on each thread for going to the latest unread post \u2014 which means that, in practical terms, for long threads, one has to read from the end of a thread to try to find where one left off last time. using the form in this way would seem to me to reduce participation because one has to spend more time doing this \u2014 and a reader is likely to do this only for the few topics in which he or she has an overwhelming interest. for me, that means that using routines or filters is essential for anyone interested in regular forum participation. as for the view count, i beg to differ, because i believe it can be an important and useful element in using luf. one example, say you've started a thread and have only a few responses but see that there are a lot a views: you might get the thread moving by making a post to that effect. i've done that, and have seen other such \"reminder posts\" that get a thread moving with wider participation. the reverse is also true: if you see that your thread has little viewership then the game ain't worth the candle and you just give up on it. that was the case of my thread on the german tv series babylon berlin, which got so few views that it wasn't worth pursuing further, despite the fact that i thought that this series was one of the best thing on tv and also an important contribution to cinema. in either case, low or high view count can be useful to know \u2014 but having to go and track down the view count for one's thread in the basic forum view is too cumbersome to do regularly. -----> i !!!  know the title of this thread, but feel it is useful to highlight the difficulties and frustrations in using luf \u2014 and a certain that @luf admin would want to know this, considering that the new forum software is still in the shakedown stage, and critical adjustments and simple solutions such as issuing a quick guide, as well as suggestions -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  earlier as well ones others have -----> made !!! , can lead to assuring greater and more effective user participation. _______________alone in bangkok essay on burn magazinenowhereman instagram", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 117848, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "LUF Admin", "date": "2018-10-01 16:01:00", "content": " Big update ahead! Next week I'll make a big update to the forum software. We are moving from IPBoard version 3.4.9 to 4.3.6 - everyone with some software knowledge will recognize that this is a big step. The migration is necessary for several reasons: Software support: The old version is no longer supported and doesn't receive security updates. PHP version: The current version is based on a PHP version which runs out. Mobile version: The new version brings a much better mobile experience Features and usability: The new version brings a modern interface and great features making contributions much easier What to do\u2026 Stay calm and carry on. You don't need to do anything until the move - if you are logging in automatically please look for your password. I'll inform you when the migration process starts and what the time schedule is. It will include a short down time for backup (~ 1-2 hours) a period in which new content will not move to the new version some days in which the new forum works but will not look perfect: About 3 mio posts and 300,000 are recalculated. Side effects I already did this migration for my other communities, so I know that some things will not run perfectly: Some passwords will not be recognized by the new software. This can be fixed either by the \u201eforgot my password\u201c function or a quick support request to me. During the first 3 days old posts look strange with some BBCode not rendered. In the first week images are displayed as small thumbnails, a background process needs some time to create high quality display images The \u201eNew content\u201c function and notifications work different and have much more options. This will lead to some confusion and sometimes to too many notification mails - but this can easily and individually be fixed. The only thing I can NOT move over are classifieds ads: There will be a new Buy & Sell area but it's based on a different software.

More keepers with the digital and it isn't just that I am older and wiser. My hat is off to those of you who can work without that little screen.

True - and the Leica SL and APO-M 50 Summicrons are designed that way (and priced that way). As an aside, showing a picture at the size of a large iPad just reveals nothing important about fine sharpness and clarity. Jon's \"whole picture\" example looks fine, also - he had to show us the cropped details to reveal what was troubling him. Jon, to me, what you are getting is about what I've always seen from the v.4/5 Summicron. Prior to the Summarit lenses, it has always been Leica's \"entry-level\" M lens - the cheapest in the line. The one they used to throw into a kit with an M body, total price discounted $500/\u00a3400. Designed to a price point, and to work very well on middle-ISO gelatin film. - 60%+ contrast at 40 lppm, over most of the picture, at f/5.6. It is also what I was getting at in the \"End of the M\" thread - don't get too excited about 48 Mp until you have actually tried some of the M lenses, especially the ones designed in the film era and not revised for digital. There's a reason the APO-Summicron costs 3 times as much as the base Summicron. The only authoritative \"second opinion\" you can get is to send this lens to Leica themselves and ask if it is performing within specs. My experience says that they will say \"Yes, that is within specs at f/4.8.\" The good news is that this is \"gaussian\" blurring that responds rather well to digital sharpening algorithms, up to a point.

After a few years, I bought into the S system which has spoiled me thoroughly. You get the look of M9 CCD files with a density of color, tonal range and depth that is seductive in a larger format. I made the move because, as a shooter of film MF and LF printed large, I was looking for a digital equivalent, which the S provides in spades. I have the 70mm which stay on my camera most of the time. It best reflects the way I see the world. Also the 35mm (a 28mm FF equivalent).Both are brilliant. Leica did its parsimonious customers a favor with its smart adapters for Contax and Hasselblad lenses. I bought the Zeiss 35mm, 120mm and 240mm with Mutar 1.4x , all for about $2500, The Contax 35mm is a splendid piece of glass and the equal to the Leica - not the same but an equivalent, though a stop slower. The 120mm macro ($800+/-) is just brilliant. I have no need to spend 4-5x more for the Leica version. The 240mm is OK but not up to its siblings. Still at about $250.... If not for the low light limitations, I would regard the 006 form factor as ideal. It feels just right in the hand - perfect in fact. The most form fitting body I have ever held - camera, that is. I like a big camera that does not feel like a big camera. That would be the S. Feels more natural than the M9 or Q even with the attached grip. Be advised that the S lenses have dodgy motor parts which can disable the AF. My 35mm crapped out and was repaired, gratis, in Germany and returned to me in the US within two weeks. My 70mm now needs the same attention. Problem is finding the right time to dispossess myself from it. And I have the split level screen which makes manual focusing a breeze, even for us glasses wearers. I could not be more enthusiastic about this camera, and most important, the images it makes. I just don't get it, frankly. The S 006 is simply the best deal on the used market that I have ever seen. Good luck with your choice - it is an embarrassment of riches.

I Have to lift my hat to this treads topic and to your very interesting posts. Been looking to buy the working version of the 0-series by Leica and even the non working UR-serie which yours is based on. I love the hand craft and size of the UR Leica and it\u00b4s great to so one that\u00b4s dedicated to make it to a real working camera (which Leica should have done in the first place). Have you tried to shoot color with it? For me it\u2019s the first time as well that I noticed this topic. I have to say it\u2019s both interesting and enjoyable to read. I\u2019m quite curious to recent developments on project no 2.I guess it is time for an update on the construction of UR Leica Replica No.2. It is being made in Seoul at this time. Of course I am risking that no one will wish to purchase this camera. I have well documented my experience with the first Replica UR that I started using almost one year ago. I know exactly what Mr. Barnack and Ernst Leitz II experienced during the period of 1914-1920. Operating the camera is really a joy. I have used it for street photography, while hiking in the mountains, and it has become second nature to slide the cover over the lens when I wind the film. Also it is small and easily fits into my pocket. At the same time I must always be careful to check that the lens is extended fully from the body. I have also found that if I use 400 ASA film, I do not need to use an exposure meter but just open up the iris diaphragm and set the wheel on top to the slower shutter speed and the pictures come out fine. In the bright light I just do the opposite. The pictures are very sharp as the lens is the same design ass to planar lens we are all familiar with from Zeiss. I also have no problem to know when the film is used up, I just shake the body. When it riddles, all the film is exposed as the feeding spool is empty and loose in its space. I then go home and in the evening unload the camera in the dark and load the film into the developing tank. I usually develop the film after two roles are in the tank. At the same time I load new film into the UR-Camera so it is ready for the next photo trip or hike in the mountains. I have described this film loading procedure before on the forum. Right now I have my first color film loaded and have taken half the roll. I am also having the second Camera made. It took a while to find the original lens at a decent price, and find a IIIa Camera cheap, and find on eBay another UR Leica Dummy at a reasonable price. My camera craftsman is now putting it all together and I expect to have it next month. Then I will put it on the forum buy and sell to see if there is any interest. Of course I will not post it until I have tested it and found that it is as good as my first copy. I am risking that someone is interested in such an unconventional but historic Camera. I was very pleased with the discussion found in the Ulf Richter Book Oskar Barnack-From the Idea to the Leica. It was recently reissues issued in 2017 by LHSA in an English translation by Rolf Fricke. It is the best discussion I have found on the original UR lens. At the same time there was little about the internals of the Camera. For instance the way in which the Camera tells you how many pictures are left on the camera. My example does not tell you this number. Also there is little about the film winding mechanism except to say that it is done by a wire cable. We did not use a wire cable, we used the gears from a III or standard Leica Camera in our sample. We felt that this was a better solution to this mechanism. I was a little discouraged that so few people responded to my Forum discussion of the Camera. I thought there would be more Forum questions but that may only mean that I have answered all the questions. As soon as I have color pictures developed, I will post them here. I plan to go to the 50 year gathering of the LHSA at Wetzlar next fall so I look forward to sharing this camera with others at that time.

I have just purchased an UR and also a Null Series. Both are currently aboard jets approaching from different sides of the World. I eagerly await using the Null, and the prospect of an operational UR is VERY enticing! I must say your images are stunning! Who would believe \u201cthat\u201d camera produced them, but of course it IS a Leica, with a Leica Lens. Has Mr. Kim expressed a desire to perform this conversion on another? I\u2019d imagine he\u2019s getting familiar with the process....now I must ask a silly question here, is UR pronounced \u201cOar\u201d, or You\u2019re\u201d? I will first try to answer the question about the pronunciation of UR. I pronounce it \u201cYou\u2019re\u201d. But I defer this question to a speaker of the German Language as it stands for a German word and they pronounce the alphabet differently than we English do. Yes, Mr. Kim has asked me about more conversions and that is why I am having him make another on the assumption that someone else would like to have an operating UR Leica. I love the camera and it is my favorite film camera. I love the way it operates, its construction and size, and its excellent resolution. I too was surprised with the final pictures and so much so that I started developing all my films as I couldn\u2019t wait for the developed pictures from the photo shop in Seoul. I continue to take pictures and recently developed some excellent examples of what this 100 year old Leitz Summar 42mm lens is capable of. It is a wonderful feeling to experience what Barnack and Ernst Leitz experienced. My only question is why didn\u2019t Wetzlar produce the camera back in 1914 when they learned what a fine camera they had. Maybe that is because the camera design was ahead of the available movie film (or was it the war?). What I refer to is the \u201cLag factor\u201d. The optics of the camera was ahead of the available film. Now we are able to appreciate the full capability of the camera because modern film is finer grained and much faster than film available then. Of course my inspiration in this project was the pictures taken soon after the UR Camera was made.

It would be fascinating to see if he managed to get the frame counter to work. I have looked at this on photos of the original and there must be some little gear wheel arrangement to get the counter to turn in a different plane from the wind knob. The drawing on page 46 of Richter's book shows a spindle behind the frame counter but not how this is turned. William William, If I were to design the film counter, I would put a peg type cog at the top of the shaft running up from the frame counter with probably 6 or 8 pegs.

There would then be a 5:1 bevel gear at the bottom to rotate the frame counter. Then 40 frames would cause one rotation of the frame counter (8 x 5).

There are so many layers in the two sequences. I agree with Steve: . My mouth agape has my chin on the floor. It's late. I need my sleep. Yes, yes, and yes. You have it all wrapped up. For How Busy They Are, I was not thinking about Kubrick, but, yes, there is that time lapse sequence that is so enigmatic, especially without words, that speaks to the mystery of life passing and remembered, simultaneously. The palimpsest of it all surfaces, again. The challenge was to restate the often stated clich\u00e9: passage of time. The intersection of all of these images brought to life after 36 years of celluloid darkness on the same roll was remarkable for me. Not that it matters, but the little girl is my niece, the older lady is my grandmother, and the tree is on my step-grandfather's land. My niece is now 43, and my grandparents have passed away. Cropping out half of the faces makes the images universal, and even gives the connotation that the little girl and the older lady may be one and the same. The black cat is, well, the black cat, though there is the black-and-white cat next to the ancient tree, the one ageless common denominator between the two images, but that black-and-white cat is absent in the second shot. I like your reading much more, the way that you have excavated the visual layers. And, of course, there is Kubrick; anything that brings him into a conversation deserves applause. The chair in Black Cat Chair I actually shot last week on ADOX: first shot with flare on the roll. I went for the darkness of the open door held open by the black chair, the black rectangle reiterated by the yellow caution rail. The background is a shopping bag, also on ADOX for a little implosion. Thanks, again, for your astute reading and charitable comments.

It is inspiring and illuminating. Your thoughts on the latent images, undeveloped for so long, and containing pictures of loved ones, reminded me of something that I'd almost forgotten - and I'm so glad you reminded me. This also fits well into the nature, I believe, of palimpsest. When Mum passed away in 2005 - Dad had already passed away - my brother and I and our families had the rather sad task of sorting things in their home - our old family home of many years. Mum was one who was loathe to get rid of anything so this was quite a big task. Anyway, amongst all the other stuff, in the loungeroom Sue and I came across an old Kodak folding autographic camera - the kind that took one of the weird film sizes like 127 or something. Through the red window at the back we could see there was an unfinished film in it, so Sue suggested kind of jokingly that she take my picture right there in the loungeroom as a kind of memento. We were living overseas at the time and things were a bit hectic - I guess I must have taken the film back with me to Fiji and developed it there. On the resulting negative sure enough there was I, on the threshold of turning 50 in the picture Sue had taken; now cue the music from the Twilight Zone - because a couple of frames earlier - there too was I, only this time in my late teens/early twenties. In the same room! Mum must have taken it at some stage and we'd forgotten all about it and she obviously hadn't used the camera again nor had the film developed. I guess that qualifies as a palimpsest. Yes, I know, photos or it didn't happen. I will search unflinchingly now until I find those negatives! Well, I found the negatives. A few of the above details were a little askew. It turns out that the photo I thought Sue had taken of me was in fact the other way round - I took a photo of her - and it was most likely in 2008 which is when I've recorded I developed the film. And in the original one of me from the 1970s (#3 on the roll of HP4 - Sue's photo is #9) it appears as though I took a self portrait. Still, the couple of photos, on the same roll taken probably 30 years apart, makes quite an interesting diptych.

Unlike other lenses I have tried where I was fiddling about with the various extension tubes to get focus (and usually failing), I could focus immediately with all three of the standard tubes in on the Componon and that gave perfect 1:1 reproduction with my SL. The other lens I tried with very similar results was a Rodenstock Rodagon 50/2,8. I could not tell which I had taken with the Rodagon apart from the focal length, which was slightly shorter than the Componon and as it was 2\u00bd times the price, I went with the Componon S. The only other comment I would make is that on Agfa Precisa reversal film, which is a warm rendering film to begin with (it has a pale brown warming substrate under the Fuji Provia emulsion), the rendition of the Componon is slightly over warm. I take my images on the BEOON with the SL at a fixed 5600\u00baK colour temperature, so it is easy enough to adjust the DNG's in PP.

(translation: the speed of a film is that \"ISO\" that will produce \"normal\" shadow detail with \"normal\" development and a \"normal density range\" to the whole negative) .....then yes, it is technically a myth. No amount of pushed developing of TX exposed at 1600, will result in the same or \"right\" amount of shadow detail as TX shot at 400 and developed normally. For the same reason already noted - additional development is multiplicative. It will mess up that M=0.1/N=0.8 density relationship. Some compensating techniques or developers can squeeze out the absolute maximum amount of shadow detail to meet the ISO test, but not really more than 1/2 stop or so (ISO 640, maybe) to satisfy the ISO definition. Silver photography is magical, but it can't fight physics. Not enough photons = not enough silver. _________________ HOWEVER, if your standard is \"a usable picture in dim light,\" you can throw the ISO technical definition out the window, and just use the definition \"I got a usable picture.\" And in that case it is not so mythological. Ideally, one would call it an EI (exposure index) rather than an ISO (since it doesn't meet the ISO definition). Ideally, a \"good push\" would mean that a gray-card gray (not a shadow tone) comes out with about the same silver density as an unpushed negative, and about the same total amount of silver in the negative, but redistributed (less than normal in the shadows, about normal for a gray-card gray, and more than normal in the highlights). A \"heroic push\" as in the sample below, means a negative that with \"heroic\" measures in the darkroom (high-contrast paper, dodging, burning, maybe ferricyanide bleaching) can still produce a final picture. Just barely enough silver in the film - with any amount of film development - to coax out the necessary tonal distinctions to reveal the subject. I shot with a 28mm f/3.5 lens, under the \"available darkness\" of one 500-watt floodlight 40 meters/yds from the subject (back over my shoulder). I didn't really \"pick\" an EI for my TX - I just shot to avoid camera shake; 1/15th at f/3.5. Then I took an incident meter reading (which showed that that exposure in that light was about equivalent to EI 4000). I then just developed the film for \"infinity\" (30 minutes or so), and accepted the very thin neg that resulted (see simulated neg densities in the \"negative\" version). Definitely not really ISO 4000, or even close, according to the amount of shadow detail/density the ISO standard calls for - but just enough mid-tone/highlight density for a dramatic picture. In any case, you will start to see the classic \"charcoal and chalk\" look of pushed film with more than a 1-stop \"push\" - a few mid-tones that are \"about right,\" with increasingly inky black shadows and nearly blank white highlights everywhere else.

If I had to send out each film to have it developed and scanned, it would be a very expensive and probably not worthwhile hobby. For me key with film is to do as much by yourself as you possibly can - starting from rolling your own 35 mm films from a 100' roll (reduces the price for a 36 frame cartridge about 50-70%) to scanning and potentially even printing with an enlarger setup.

The labeling of the bottles might be a bit off - for B&W processes no bleach is needed but either water or stopper fluid after the development step instead. Even for color C-41 development, most development packs now prefer to have bleach and fixer combined (called Blix).

I do all at \"room temperature\" which varies in Texas with season and heat or A/C settings. I do keep all solutions at the same temperature, storing 2 gallons of de-ionized water with the stock solutions for mixing and film rinse (using the Iilford 3-change method of washing instead of running water, as tap water temperature gets pretty high here in summer). So my processing may be anywhere in the range of 68 to 78 degrees F. Thanks, Tom. What you said in the first line of your question is the way to go, \u201ckeep it basic and by the book\u201d. You do not say what film or developer you are using but either one probably gives you the time for the normal temperature of 20c. Ilford films give a chart of time adjustments for different temperatures which I have found useful in the summer. You can probably find the chart on the web and it might well be the same for any developer and film as I think it is a purely chemical reaction question? If you can keep your stop and fix temperatures within a few degrees of the developer that will help. You want to avoid any sharp increase or drop from one bath to another. I do not think you need to worry about the wash water increasing in temperature during the wash time, the gradual increase in temperature will just help the film to wash quicker. I do not think there will be any difference in quality of the negatives providing the temperature range is not too wide or has a dramatic jump between one bath and the next. The days of reticulated grain are long gone I hope. The last time I saw wrinkled emulsion was developing Ferannia colour slide film back in the 70\u2019s. Thanks, P. I use Ilford DD-X and either FP4+ or HP5+, always at box speed. The smaller the film the less tolerance you\u2019ll have for temperature fluctuations in the developer. The leeway varies per film too. Stopping and fixing a little bit warmer won\u2019t harm. If it gets too hot you can get reticulation (crackles in the emulsion), but that will start only above 30 Celsius I guess. It also depends on your end product: are you developing to scan or for a wet print, AAD or AAA? In my experience scanning is more forgiving. In wet printing you can choose a lower grade paper with multicontrast filters if the negative is too hard, but in general a relatively soft negative is a better starting point in the search for the best contrast for your subject. A variation of one degree Celsius won\u2019t give irreversible problems with multicontrast papers. Thanks, Otto. I shoot only 35mm. I suppose I develop to scan but like to think I could send film to a pro lab for wet prints if I have something special. I don't have a darkroom. In summary, it sounds like using a Massive Development chart or app and adjusting for temperature of chemicals is not a problem.

What I do is to use for rins finishing destilled water a a last step for approximately 15 minutes and then I use the salad spinner to remove the rest. No water agent, no squeeze, no watermarks Agree with the post above - use distilled water from a bottle purchasable in a grocery store as final wash. Pour 250 ml of distilled water onto the reel which has still the developed film rolled inside. Pour a bit on top and on bottom of the reel, and then on the side and into the film lever. This is sufficient wo rinse off most of the hard/regular water drops. Then hang the film to dry, don't squeeze. Simply let the drops evaporate or rinse off. Ray, your issue is only in part due to rinsing. It would be best to also mix your chemistry in distilled water. Mixing the chemistry in destilled water (what is generally a good idea) will not prevent the film from the watermarks if using the hard tap water for rinsing Well, of course not. I wrote in addition to rinsing in distilled, also mix using distilled. I live in a hard water area as well and do get some watermarks despite using a wetting agent in the final rinse water. I hang the film up and wipe off the excess water around the sprocket holes with my wet fingers but do not wipe down the frames except to wipe off any large blobs of water, avoiding touching the emulsion. Usually you can rub off any small watermarks if they are on the back of the film once it is dry. Just did that this afternoon with a test roll in a pre-war Kodak Retina 1. The mark on your first picture looks quite big which seems unusual and the streak on the second picture does not look like a watermark. I ought to use distilled water but don\u2019t. I have got some as it was recommended for mixing pyro developer. I think the best thing to avoid them is using wetting agent in the last rinse for a minute or so before taking out the spiral. Use proper photographic wetting agent, not washing up liquid. We have an under-sink reverse osmosis filter for drinking water, so I fill a couple of 1 gallon jugs from it and store them with my darkroom chemicals. RO filtering is almost to distilled water purity, so I use it for mixing and all film rinsing and washing. For washing I use the Ilford method of 3 tank fulls with lots of inversion agitation instead of a running water wash, which saves water and has been shown to give equivalent results. Using a 1-reel stainless tank I use about a half gallon of water per roll of film. After the 3-fills Ilford wash I use a final dip in RO water with 2-3 drops of flo before hanging to dry, which helps keep droplets from forming on the film, but is so dilute it doesn\u2019t leave deposits. Not from my experience - wetting agent didn't stop watermark residues at all - I tried both with regular detergent liquid and with photographic wetting agents. They both did nothing - don't even see much difference in regard to dust accumulation on the film when drying. I found best is simply rinsing with distilled water, I am not using any wetting agent anymore. Do you have soft water, or a water softener? Soft water, but without my final distilled water rinse I will have water droplet stains on my negatives, too. Well, this was like playing a game of Clue and I've solved the mystery.

My understanding is that with semi stand development (one turn of the tank at the midpoint of the development time) the duration that the film is in the developer depends on the developer itself (and the dilution) rather than the film and speed (pushed or not). Generally. I tried stand development with a roll of 120 that I had preloaded into a tank months ago and never gotten round to developing. I totally forgot what the film was so I figured, based on what I remembered of some reading I did in the past, that stand development would solve that. I did it in HC110 for 45 mins with a turn halfway. It developed the film nicely. I was thinking, since the development time depends on the developer and not the film/speed then: 1) If I have a multi reel tank, I can put in a variety of B&W films of different brands with different box speeds and/or pushed/pulled speeds and they should all develop fine (assuming no issued with banding and streaking etc.) right? And, 2) If the answer to the above is a \"YES\", that I can develop any combination of B&W films at (almost) any combination of ISOs then, I guess that I could develop a single roll where some of the frames were shot at box and other frames pushed and others pulled perhaps.

So.. I was realized that I liked the shadows of Xtol stock and Rodinal 1:50 highlights and I was thinking that maybe I could do a split development. Your images posted for HP5 split development looks amazing! Sharp, nice grain, very good separation between light, mid-tones and shadows, nothing mushy (like HP5 in straight Rodinal 1:50). Maybe can you share your recipe of split development? Something like Xtol stock or 1+1 for some% of total development time AND Rodinal 1:50/1:100 for rest of development time. Or maybe in the reversed order, I really have no idea. I hope you still have an account here and you will read this post at some time. Many thanks, Bogdan Hi Bogdan, here is my recipe for HP5+ 400 at ISO 400: 20 deg C water temperature 1. Rodinal diluted 1:100 for 10 minutes. Agitate every 2 minutes. 2. 3x rinse with water for 30 seconds each time 3. Xtol diluted 1:2 for 6 minutes. Agitate every minute. 4. Stop solution for 1 minute, agitate. 5. Fixer solution for 10 minutes, agitate every minute. 6. 2x rinse with water 7. Hypo Clearing Agent wash for 2 minutes, agitate every 30 seconds. 8. Final water rinse.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/258970-dual-development-which-one-to-use-first/?tab=comments#comment-3494223", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "258970-dual-development-which-one-to-use-first", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i have a 100 feet -----> roll !!!  of hp5 at home and i developed it until now in rodinal , d76 and xtol.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105811, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Jodad", "date": "2018-02-26 10:59:00", "content": " Hey guys. So i now have a bunch of different rolls of B&W film (TMax, TriX,HP5,Foma100 etc.) that have been shot and are sitting in my fridge waiting to be developed. Most (other than a few 100s and 200s) are 400 ISO and some have been shot at box speed but most have been pushed between 1 and 2 stops. Is there a developer that I can use to develop all of these films? I'm not in the position to buy a bunch of different devs to suit each film. Is there sort of a jack of all trades developer that you guys recommend?
