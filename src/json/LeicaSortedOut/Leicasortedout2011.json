Nowadays we know that , for maximum quality, we need a multi-pass sharpening workflow. If you apply single-pass sharpening you are attempting to account for image source, image content and output process in a single round of sharpening. Mulitipass sharpening takes account of the sometimes contradictory requirements of the different steps in sharpening. To begin with we need a content optimized master image that can be used in further processing to apply creative sharpening and the finally sharpening for specific output. I will take the case for ACR/CS5 because that is what I am used to. Always work at 100% or larger! The object of this capture sharpening is to create an artefact-free ( as far as possible) optimally sharpened file to process further. The image content can be divided in three types: high-frequency images ( think of a landscape with plenty of leafy trees, large amounts of small detail) and low-frequency images ( portraits with smooth skin) and mixed images. The three require different approaches. The main tool here is the radius slider: The higher the frequency, the lower the setting 0.5 to 1.0 Low frequency images require settings between 1.0 and 1.5 That is about the maximum you can use. Typical amount settings would be 15-30 for M9 files, 5-20 for M8 files. The obvious problem is the mixed image. Think eyes and eybrows/hair in that low-frequence portrait.. There are several approaches. 1. Set the radius to 1.0 and try to correct in Photoshop 2. Set for low frequency in sharpening and use the correction brush on areas that need more detail 3. Make two smart objects for different frequencies and blend with a layer mask in Photoshop. You can (in ACR 6.0) create an edge mask using the masking sider. Enlarge to at least 100% and hold the ALT key whilst sliding. You can see where the sharpening will be masked. Then you can bring back detail by using the detail slider in the same way. It is not a simple slider, because it influences a number of parameters. Never mind what it does, the results are quite visible. Then you can switch back and use the clarity slider to enhance your settings. Don't forget you have local control with the adjustment brush. When you are in Photoshop you can sharpen creatively by enhancing areas. You can either use the sharpening brush or make a layer, (over)sharpen it, use a layer mask and play with opacity. In general, always sharpen on a layer, to work non-destructively. There is also the trick of setting USM to a radius of 50 and threshold to 1, using the amount slider for control (normally around 20) to get midtone contrast enhancement to bring out extra detail, but I digress When you have the image to your taste you flatten it and go to output sharpening. For printing you can use your Scott Kelby technique (*) and learn the optimum setting by trial and error or you can delve into the theory and set the sharpening haloes mathematically. The avantage is that you have an optimally sharpened image to start with so you won't have any nasty surprises. (*) Use Unsharp Mask to taste and go to \"fade unsharp mask\" in the edit menu and fade 100% on Luminosity Lightroom works a bit differently, but I do not have the expertise to explain that clearly . LR addition by Marquinius Lightroom works mostly like you describe. When you are used to the ACR (the RAW editor upon opening a photo in photoshop), you'll get used to LR in a jiffy. For sharpening you have the same tools, to be found under DETAIL. What I do (in simple steps): 1) I import a photo in LR with the standard primary sharpening (very low, just to get rid of the softness resulting from RAW). 2) I work the photo until it's \"perfect\" (all conversions, editing, even side stepping to CS, whatever) BUT (and this is important) WITHOUT any further sharpening. 3) I make a virtual duplicate of the edited photo 4) I start my sharpening on this virtual, following the same logic Jaap just described. In this way you always keep the unsharpened image separate from the sharpened ones: printing for screen asks for a different approach the sharpening for print (and for print you can even go to small print/big print, soft paper, toned paper, whatever). You use the unsharpened photo as a starting point. Of course you could make a snapshot and return to that point every time you want to sharpen for a different output, but the you'd overwrite previous efforts. Follow-up question: How do I prepare an image for display on this forum? Answer: My favorite technique is to set the crop tool to 960 px wide (and 640 px high if desired) and crop the full image. Then add Unsharp Mask at maybe a 15-30 amount at radius 1.0 and threshold 0 for a bit of sparkle. Go to Edit, fade Unsharp Mask, choose \"Luminosity\" in the pull-down menu.

This solved my M9 back focusing very quickly and your instructions were very well detailed. Just another helpful tip though it may sound obvious. Do not use the camera display to check image tests, download them to your PC and check. The camera LCD is just not up to snuff to zoom in and calibrate. Brett - --img--  I know this is not for everyone and that's not what I'm saying - my aim in posting is to share the work I have done and the successes I have had with my own adjustments. It is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. It is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. That's all. So Jamie - this is the explanation I posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. As adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. You will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (A) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. A) is the focus throw adjustment. If you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. If you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. As you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. By moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you INCREASE the total available focus throw. By moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you DECREASE the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. Right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. From my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) Infinity is very important. Step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today I've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. Don't accept the nonesense I was spouting before about it not mattering. It really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) Now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. I found text to be excellent. Note whether you now have front focus or back focus. If you have front focus (like I did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. So you need to shorten the arm by loosening (A) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise. (If you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) Now, recheck infinity. It will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. But this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) Repeat step 2. You will see that the focus point has altered. Whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general I made positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) When you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. On my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) I did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. When my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range. I suppose that if this were not the case or if your lenses varied then you'd need to get them recalibrated, or maybe accept a compromise setting. Hope that's helpful.

Hans, your data is showing that the M9 is shot noise limited (i.e. the noise is pretty much caused by the arrival rate of the photons itself, and the sensor circuitry adds very little noise if any, at least for a good part of the ISO / gain range). All good cameras behave in a narrow band when it comes to this.. From a sensor output stanpoint, ETTR (if this not explained somewhere else already): Take for instance, your favorite M9, 1. The ADC (analog-digital converter - the block which is responsible for digitizing pixel output) output is 14 bit for the M9, which means this block is capable of breaking down a pixel output into 16384 levels (or tones), and assume that the ADC assigns these codes in a monotonic fashion with 0 for the purest black and 16383 for the purest white. So, purest black: 00 0000 0000 0000 ( 'd0: short hand for decimal 0), Purest white: 11 1111 1111 1111 ('d16383). In practice, the purest black and purest white are not exactly at the ends of this range, but somewhat lower than the ends of this range. Now take a scene where all the tones in the histogram are uniformly distributed (i.e. all these 16384 levels occur at least once). If you underexpose this scene, what happens is that some of the levels between 8191 and 16383 (I used half of the full range as an example) get incorrectly shifted towards the lower half of the full range. With the severity of underexposure, more of the upper half of the tonal range gets shifted. However, the problem arises when this \"RAW\" data from the sensor needs to be gamma mapped (i.e the sensor response needs to be mapped to what a human eye sees). Now if one were to map an underexposed scene (generally involves stretching both the ends of the captured histogram), RAW converters / camera processors have limited information (especially at the high end), and this information needs to be mapped to the higher end of the histogram. ie we are asking to create information out of thin air. The histogram can be shifted, but it is like adding more light to a certain part of the histogram. If one is not careful, subtle shifts in tonality are lost. RAW converters / onboard processing has come a long way in this regards. And the reverse is not the case with an over exposed histogram, because it involves redistributing already existing data to lower values, and setting the corresponding black level. Also, one doesn't want to lift the shadows too much because of noise concerns (usually at low gain settings, sensor circuitry tends to be noisier, and hence lower S/N ratio). Also, some sensors try to allocate extra information at the ends of the tonal range. From a sensor perspective, does ETTR help? Yes and no. It largely depends on the scene histogram distribution, photographic goals and noise / tonality concerns. If a scene has large shadow areas, one might be better off exploiting this technique (without blowing out the highlights). If the scene is uniformly distributed, then there is very little to achieve by ETTR. Through this simple shifting of bits around, color tonality gets affected. Human eyes are exceptional at perceiving shifts in color tonality than what the current state of art cameras can achieve. Also, RAW developers are starting to develop floating point arithmetic for RAW analysis. This should help with some of these issues. There is no free lunch. --img--  With a mathematical model of the M9, much can be taken out of the guesswork. The accurate model that I have, contains all existing kinds of noise, Photon Noise, Sensor noise, A/D Noise, Photo response non uniform etc. giving a reliable picture of the Signal to Noise of the complete camera. I have calculated the noise of the two combinations ISO 160/320 and ISO 800/1600, in both cases the lower ISO value with \u201cnormal\u201d exposure and the higher ISO value with +1 stop ETTR. First the graphical representation of both combinations, where yellow is the higher and magenta is the lower ISO value of the two. On the horizontal axis, 13 is the highest or lightest level, just before overexposure. Going to the left is decreasing the luminance. On the vertical axis is the Signal to Noise in stops. Zero means that the signal is just as strong as the noise, and 6 means that the signal is 2exp6 = 64 times stronger as the noise. [ATTACH]273092[/ATTACH] The graphs are roughly showing that the S/N is the same for all luminance values when the higher ISO value is exposed with +1 stop ETTR. For instance the yellow dot at Luminance 7 has the same S/N as the Magenta dot at Luminance 6, and so on. But the graphs are not accurate enough to show the exact difference. So here are the S/N values at the Luminance levels 12 \u20137 for ISO 160, compared to S/N at the Luminance levels 13-8 ( +1 stop ETTR ) for ISO 320. [ATTACH]273094[/ATTACH] At lower Luminance levels (darker area\u2019s) there is an absolute insignificant S/N advantage of 0,05 stops in favor of ISO 320 with +1 stop ETTR. At the higher Luminance levels (lighter area\u2019s) there is no difference at all. Now for ISO 800 and ISO 1600. [ATTACH]273095[/ATTACH] Although the S/N in absolute value is worse than at ISO 160/320, the relative value between S/N at ISO 800 is exactly the same as the S/N value at ISO 1600 with 1 stop ETTR. There is simply no difference. When just looking at noise, the conclusion is: Instead of shifting the exposure +1 stop ETTR, one can just as well go one Stop down in ISO without overexposure. This is true for low as well as high ISO values, and it is true over the whole range from light to dark. According to Sandy, there is a negative effect of ETTR on color reproduction. ETTR should therefore be avoided.

Even though the mirror goes up, you aren't blinded, and can easily see the pre flash in the room, with your peripheral vision, or with your other eye. I absolutely cannot see a pre-flash with Canon, and it is really obvious with the Leica. Just FYI, I am shooting the Mark 4 and Mark 3S cameras. I have no idea how the consumer Canon bodies handle it because I don't use them. There is something else going on here, I'm guessing drastically slower processing, or less than optimal design of the circuit. Maybe the designers did not make it a priority to make a short gap because they were designers, not photographers. Only a photographer would know how a perceptible pre-flash would ruin a shot. Let's face it, some genius designer came up with the utterly worthless red eye reduction! So here's my conclusion. If you need to shoot people photos with the M9 and flash on the camera and don't want to have them blinking, don't use TTL with the M9. Other techniques (off camera) and methods (auto mode) seem to work better. I'm just trying to put this out there so that when the next person finds this thread while trying to decide whether to buy this flash, and what it is capable of will have the information.

Whether it works for you depends on your expectations and the way you work. Mike Mike, I don't think, somebody let the intern design the Leica variant of TTL flashes or the cameras circuitry, to communicate. We are talking about Metz, a company, which does flash for quite a time and Leica, a renowned lens, camera and fashion maker, not Sony. The way, I see the lack in the Leica flashes, compared to Canon and Nikon products is just this: flash is an afterthought in development for the Leica M. Not the majority of Leica M users uses flash, if TTL flash at all. Flash has no priority. For Canon and Nikon, flash is essential. The pro cameras, which are sold to big extends to professional users as journalists, sports shooters and alike need the best performance out of strobes - there is a strong market need AND A RACE between the two companies, to improve their already market leading performance. Why should Leica pair with Metz and compete with the performance of Canon and Nikon with flash? It is not Leica's main market. That time was in the 50's. And even back then, the M was not the big rig, to shoot with bulbs (it could be done, and some did), but it's reason of being was small size, but excellent quality on the negative paired with simple operation. The people, who might want to use TTL flash opposed to manual or Auto flash want a quick shot, be it out of convenience or out of quick changing lighting conditions. It is like it is and the SF58 is the best solution, if one needs TTL on a Leica (the only others being a set of Metz items or the SF24D). I use Nikon and love the simple fully automated and spot on Nikon metering and TTL flash, when I want it (again: convenience for me) or the excellent ergonomics, when needed in manual modes (product shots). I bought the SF58, to expand the poor low light performance of the M8.2 sensor, to use lower ISO in very dark scenes. It does the job - sort of (still learning/ fighting).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/99414-reidreview-review-of-leica-sf58-flash-unit/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-1579602", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "99414-reidreview-review-of-leica-sf58-flash-unit", "result": true, "Selector": "came up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "\u2026 maybe the designers did not make it a priority to make a short gap because they were designers, not photographers. only a photographer would know how a perceptible pre-flash would ruin a shot. let's face it, some genius designer -----> came !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  the utterly worthless red eye reduction! so here's my conclusion. if you need to shoot people photos with the m9 and flash on the camera and don't want to have them blinking, don't use ttl with the m9. other techniques (off camera) and methods (auto mode) seem to work better. i'm just trying to put this out there so that when the next person finds this thread while trying to decide whether to buy this flash, and what it is capable of will have the information. i am not a guy who spends a lot of time reading or posting on forums, i just go when i need information. the ttl is not working for me. whether it works for you depends on your expectations and the way you work. mike mike, i don't think, somebody let the intern design the leica variant of ttl flashes or the cameras circuitry, to communicate. we are talking about metz, a company, which does flash for quite a time and leica, a renowned lens, camera and fashion maker, not sony. the way, i see the lack in the leica flashes, compared to canon and nikon products is just this: flash is an afterthought in development for the leica m. not the majority of leica m users uses flash, if ttl flash at all. flash has no priority. for canon and nikon, flash is essential. the pro cameras, which are sold to big extends to professional users as journalists, sports shooters and alike need the best performance out of strobes - there is a strong market need and a race between the two companies, to improve their already market leading performance. why should leica pair with metz and compete with the performance of canon and nikon with flash? it is not leica's main market. that time was in the 50's. and even back then, the m was not the big rig, to shoot with bulbs (it could be done, and some did), but it's reason of being was small size, but excellent quality on the negative paired with simple operation. the people, who might want to use ttl flash opposed to manual or auto flash want a quick shot, be it out of convenience or out of quick changing lighting conditions. it is like it is and the sf58 is the best solution, if one needs ttl on a leica (the only others being a set of metz items or the sf24d). i use nikon and love the simple fully automated and spot on nikon metering and ttl flash, when i want it (again: convenience for me) or the excellent ergonomics, when needed in manual modes (product shots). i bought the sf58, to expand the poor low light performance of the m8.2 sensor, to use lower iso in very dark scenes. it does the job - sort of (still learning/ fighting).", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 37785, "year": "2011"}, {"autor": "gravastar", "date": "2011-02-16 01:16:00", "content": "Well, all I can say is that using my Canon Mk3S and Mk4 cameras I absolutely cannot see the preflash and have never had an issue with blinking.

Cheers John Hi John, I think that what concerns Richard and I is that the Zeiss finder( which I otherwise love for its brightness and clarity) may introduce a potential rotational error off the sensor/lens axis which alters perspective, not a simple framing or angular problem which can be corrected afterwards in Light Room etc. I have no such problem with my other lenses.

Plenty of room for flatter items that couldn't fit in the A&A at all without sticking way out of the rear pocket. But it does have something from the A&A that I personally prefer and that is a zipper as access to the main compartment. For me, this is much easier to work out of compared to a flap-top bag. The Tumi, worn cross-body like I wear all my camera bags, is more comfortable even without a shoulder pad. It hugs the body, and can be rotated from front to back with ease and never gets in the way even when traversing through tight crowds. My wife even carried it for a few minutes when my hands were full and the first thing out of her mouth was \"wow, this is comfortable!\" Better than Billingham for me, due to a few reasons. Styling - doesn't stand out due to a contrast in style both in what's in style these days and my own personal style. I'm a younger guy and I dress even younger. Billingham sticks out like a sore thumb on me. Fuction - I love billingham's padding, but i prefer the pockets, zippers, flaps, and strap on the Tumi. Easy to work out of and feels more secure, especially the smaller pockets. Size - This of course depends on which model Billingham, but I had the Hadley Pro and obviously this bag is much smaller but it worked great for a 3 lens kit and would fit another lens or two if you don't mind stacking. But i feel like i could fit more in this small bag compared to a Billingham in the same size. Better than (current) canvas Domke for a few reasons as well. Compared to f-5xb and f-803 waxwear. Construction... it's some kind of ballistic nylon or something. Super tough yet nice and flexible. Easy access. The front clip/flap of the 803 sucks. Storage. The pockets on the 803 flap are pretty worthless. Could fit an ipad in back and not fond of the front pockets and none of these feel secure. Looks better (subjective). Not that comfy to wear. 5xb is more comfy than the 803 imho, due to size i guess. Crumpler. Crumpler I always want to like. I like their modern look, they have some decent details/ideas for storage and great padding, yet they make their bags sooooo tight! They really need to \"loosen the belt\" a bit. Trying to access small pockets is a real chore, and I have small hands. This also restricts how much you can carry. They also utilize a flap to cover the main compartment which I already mentioned I'm not fond of. And due to the padding and tight design/construction, the bag doesn't hug the body. Think Tank. They make some amazing bags, especially for dslr cameras. They put more thought into the design/function of their bags than anyone, especially for the pro shooters. But they are ugly and bulky and just not made for rangefinders. Even their newer Retrospective line of bags which look better, are too bulky and just too much bag for an M kit, IMHO. I had Retro 10 when they were first released and returned it immediately. Another line of bags that I really want to like but just can't. Ok, that's pretty much it. If any of this helps anyone, cool. Remember, it's all just my personal opinion and what works for me may not work for you and vice-versa.

Hence you meet people who has a grey paint Leica and they love despite the fact they didn't like it to begin with. And want the same camera next time. Or chrome or black. And when you have a stack of cameras in front of you, the one you like the best is usually your own. But also, when you meet someone with a different camera who have made a very decicive choose and are very happy with it, you tend to like that camera too. So this speaks for that one can do nothing or even a general choice of engraving such as no engraving at all, with classic Leica logo, with or without red dot, etc. and you will love the camera in any case. But I would also say that if you feel for getting your own signature or initials - then go for it. As you can send in a Leica for engraving (which usually means they will do the engraving on a brand new top plate and replace the old one with the new one), you may send in an engraved Leica and ask to get a different engraving in case you should want to sell it. I don't know about the MP, but for the M9 the engraving is ca. 200 Euro. So I wouldn't make a big deal out of it. I would simply get whatever makes me happy. Even a poem or a drawing. Should you one day want to sell it and you don't expect the buyer to like the engraving, have it redone to another standard one.

However, the engraving was done the same way for employee cameras and the format was used by Leica up through the M6. I have not seen a standardized format for the M7 or MP, as the regular A la Carte options put the engraving elsewhere. So, my dilemma was whether to stick with the M3-style engraving on the back, or come up with a new format to fit the newer style camera. I chose the latter, as the contemporary MP is not typically engraved like the M3, which includes \"WETZLAR, GERMANY\" on the top of the top plate. Newer models without the classic M3-style engraving on top have always had \"MADE IN GERMANY\" or \"GERMANY\" engraved on the back. Also, the engraved text on the backs of newer Ms is typically aligned against the bottom of the top plate, as opposed to being vertically centered. So, since my MP only says \"LEICA\" on top, I felt it more \"regular\" to go with my modified setup. One thing is for sure: I really can't stand the inclusion of \"LEICA CAMERA\" on the back.

I would be happy to be proven wrong. I make no contentions about directions, only about selections of work that I will accept. Because I like using Leica, and because of it's form factor, I choose to use it. Last week, I shot a stage production using both Leica and Hasselblad. The client actually noticed I was using the Hasselblad again and reminisced about the days when that was all I used.

So, if you're relatively certain that you'll attend, I'd like to hear from you. You can contact me most easily by email: hflockwoodATverizonDOTnet, or pm me if that's better for you.

Very informal, very friendly, no age discrimination; the latter to protect me. And as for the door prize, only one restriction.

I will, however, need at least a few days, preferably one week to arrange for the meeting with the Beacon Tavern. So, let's set up a vote. Three choices: 15th; 29th; either.
