I am a big fan. I have multiple M lenses, incl. the Noctilux, 50 APO M, Summiluxes and the SL2 and multiple lenses, incl. the APO SLs. It is just a fact though, that the S system is a LOT less wide spread amongst professional studios than Phase One and Hasselblad. Not gonna recite all the reasons for this. What I was told what was said was is that the S camera is mostly bought by well off enthusiasts and people already owning an SL or M. And it is also the reality that most of those \"enthusiasts\" shoot mundane subjects with their expensive S camera because it is just not their job to setup shoots, pay for models, location scouts, stylists, etc. And most of them have an intensive job, so time is scarce! So what you end up is dog, flower, and kid pics with an odd landscape here and there. Nothing wrong with that! Photography has been commoditised and is a wide spread hobby and the money for the companies nowadays lies with the enthusiast segment, all I am saying!
