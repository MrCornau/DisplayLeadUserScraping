I know this will rub some people the wrong way, but I plan on creating detailed color maps and grain scans of Pro 400H so that at the very least we can create detailed film emulations in the future. I also know that Pro 400H isn't everyone's favorite film, but because it's being discontinued I figured I'd start with it. Maybe there's another discontinued film the community would prefer?\n\nTo do this I am planning on taking identical shots with Pro 400H and a matching digital shot of various color calibration charts, HALD charts, etc, digitally aligning them and measuring the color differential. I assume that this is how a lot of film emulation LUTs are made, but because nobody ever publishes their methodology or source material, I don't know if they're really doing that or just eyeballing the vibe.\n\nThe thing is, I need a film camera and lens that can also be attached to a mirrorless camera (I have a Fuji body but I might pick up a Sony for this project down the line).\n\n**Here's the question: does anyone have any recommendations for bodies and lens systems that work well across both platforms?**\n\nI was originally considering a Nikon body, but it seems really hard to find a body on eBay that's in known-working condition, and apparently many of them are sticky? Canon EF film cameras might be better.\n\nHere are some things to consider: I think for a project like this, exposure control is going to be very important. I need to be able to push and pull the film accurately, so something with good metering and exposure compensation would be really good. I have a light meter, and I'm prepared to do the calculations myself, but in the interest of time it'd be nice to have EV compensation.\n\nI am also looking for lens recommendations, since the color of the lens will also be tied up in the end result. I think perhaps a more modern lens would be good, since they're quite sharp and have a more \"clinical\" color reproduction. Another consideration is that my office isn't the biggest, so a 200mm lens will probably not work.\n\nBefore I go, some acknowledgements: First, I don't think it's possible to *FULLY* emulate a film stock's character digitally *at all*, but if we can get 80% of the way there with even remotely reproducible results, that's a win in my book. Second, I do intend on doing real-world identical shots as well, but for now I'm just focusing on the color and exposure maps.\n\nI would love anyone's thoughts.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ohjgma/digitally_archiving_fuji_pro_400h/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "maps", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "digitally archiving fuji pro 400h /!/ hi everyone,\n\ni recently read that fujifilm is discontinuing pro 400h. i know this will rub some people the wrong way, but i plan on creating detailed color -----> maps !!!  and grain scans of pro 400h so that at the very least we can create detailed film emulations in the future. i also know that pro 400h isn't everyone's favorite film, but because it's being discontinued i figured i'd start with it. maybe there's another discontinued film the community would prefer?\n\nto do this i am planning on taking identical shots with pro 400h and a matching digital shot of various color calibration charts, hald charts, etc, digitally aligning them and measuring the color differential. i assume that this is how a lot of film emulation luts are made, but because nobody ever publishes their methodology or source material, i don't know if they're really doing that or just eyeballing the vibe.\n\nthe thing is, i need a film camera and lens that can also be attached to a mirrorless camera (i have a fuji body but i might pick up a sony for this project down the line).\n\n**here's the question: does anyone have any recommendations for bodies and lens systems that work well across both platforms?**\n\ni was originally considering a nikon body, but it seems really hard to find a body on ebay that's in known-working condition, and apparently many of them are sticky? canon ef film cameras might be better.\n\nhere are some things to consider: i think for a project like this, exposure control is going to be very important. i need to be able to push and pull the film accurately, so something with good metering and exposure compensation would be really good. i have a light meter, and i'm prepared to do the calculations myself, but in the interest of time it'd be nice to have ev compensation.\n\ni am also looking for lens recommendations, since the color of the lens will also be tied up in the end result. i think perhaps a more modern lens would be good, since they're quite sharp and have a more \"clinical\" color reproduction. another consideration is that my office isn't the biggest, so a 200mm lens will probably not work.\n\nbefore i go, some acknowledgements: first, i don't think it's possible to *fully* emulate a film stock's character digitally *at all*, but if we can get 80% of the way there with even remotely reproducible results, that's a win in my book. second, i do intend on doing real-world identical shots as well, but for now i'm just focusing on the color and exposure maps.\n\ni would love anyone's thoughts.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 9787, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 265092, "autor": "Imnotreallythere", "date": 1625306035000, "content": "A project I picked up.
