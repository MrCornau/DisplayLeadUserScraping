Hopefully folks here can shed some light.\n\nI have been shooting a lot of medium format over the past year, and it has been going quite well. I thought I had a good grasp on the Zone System and spot metering. I have put several rolls of slide film (Provia 100F and Velvia 50) through my camera, and all of them came out quite well in terms of exposure. I was pretty confident in my metering technique.\n\nI was excited to get out and shoot some beautiful New England fall colors this season. I shot one roll of Velvia 50 in a wet forest during peak foliage, where the scene was exploding with some greens, reds, and most of all, yellows. \n\nI felt great about the roll and didn't worry so much about the exposure. I took my readings and placed the brightest areas no higher than Zone VII (as I understand, Velvia 50 has about 5 stops of DR from Zone III to VII). For what it's worth, I am using a \"Zone VI Modified\" Pentax Digital Spotmeter. Now, Imagine my disappointment when I get my slides back from the lab and nearly all of them are overexposed. And when I say overexposed, I mean about 3 stops or more. As heartbreaking as it is, I am still trying to figure out exactly what happened and learn from it. I am not going to blame the camera or the light meter, since the images with grass and other colors turned out well, and I don't think I made *that* big of a miscalculation in my metering. I think I'm not understanding something about spotmeters, the Zone System, and colors.\n\nI was reading the manual for the spotmeter, and I came across a paragraph that I thought answered my question (attached). The paragraph says: \"The reflectivity of yellow is lower than that of white, but yellow has the highest reflectivity of all the colors... Consequently, if a light level value taken from a reading of a yellow area is set on the exposure calculator according to the standard index, the photography will be somewhat underexposed.\"\n\nNow, that confused me even more. If yellow has the *highest* reflectivity (and the accompanying chart suggests using an index of 8 for yellow scenes), wouldn't that mean the image would be *overexposed* if I didn't compensate? \n\nIn summary, have two questions:\n\n1. What is the manual saying with regard to metering with color (what is the Index No. it's referring to)?\n2. How can I go about avoiding this in the future? Is using a gray card is the answer?\n\nThanks a lot everyone.
