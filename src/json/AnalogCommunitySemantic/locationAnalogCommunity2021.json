I have not been able to calibrate it since I only have the body atm. Once I can afford the rest of the stuff and run a roll through it I will update this post to show how it actually went. This is fix the method I used for getting the spring and mirror stop arm installed on the Mamiya 645 Super. Hopefully this helps in some capacity.\n\nIf you have the mamiya 645 pro, or need help removing the mirror stop arm... use this video -&gt; [Focus Error Fix for Mamiya 645 Pro - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2BZEPjngMA&amp;t=656s). The method he used works great for the pro because there is a notch cut out or the spring. This method did not work for my 645 Super because there is no notch. Maybe I'm dumb but I tried for hours and couldn't do it. \n\nFor the mamiya 645 Super the location where you hook the long spring arm is incredibly hard to find. u/Brcamera said it best, with the super you are pretty much going in blind. So, being the smooth brain I am, I didn't take pictures so I made some pictures that I hope will help. If you are missing or have a broken spring it's GGs. I did this by going from the front of the camera btw\n\nTools: Tweezers, bent tweezers, fingers, screwdrivers, depression, beer.\n\n1) Remove the mirror stop arm. The youtube video I recommended shows the process.\n\n2) This takes a lot of feeling around, but hook the long end into that notch and rotate the spring towards the gold post that holds the arm. This will set the hook. You can tug on it a little to check too. \n\n3) Slightly lift the spring high enough to squeeze the arm onto the post. It's a tight squeeze so use some really thin/long tweezers to help. \n\n4) With the spring hooked on, and the arm in the hardest part is grabbing the small side of the spring and hooking it to the backside of the arm. For this, I grabbed another set of thin/long tweezers, and bent the tips to create a little hook to grab onto the spring. I screwed the mirror stop arm down, put my finger over the screw to hold the spring down, and then used the tweezers to hook and pull the spring down until it latched onto the bottom side of the of the arm where it's supposed to go. \n\n5) Done\n\nIdk if this will help at all but I'm tired af and wanted to post it before I forget.
