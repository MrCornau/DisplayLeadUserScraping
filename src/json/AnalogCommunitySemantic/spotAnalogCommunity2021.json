I found that NGA produces beautiful, sharp scans that are free of Newton Rings, just like ANR glass does. This makes NGA an economical and easy to source alternative for ANR glass.\n\nNGA didn't come without its flaws, though. Most notably, it was very easy to damage, particularly through scratches. I found that even light cleaning could leave scratches on the acrylic, which reduce scan quality. The acrylic can also become bent and warped over time, which may cause it to not lay flat. Glass products, like ANR, do not suffer from these drawbacks.\n\nOn my post about NGA, u/Nikon-FE made a comment claiming that etched frame glass \"works just like ANR glass without the ANR tax.\" This seemed likely to be true, considering that NGA worked, and it uses a similar textured side to etched frame glass. However, there were also some comments claiming that etched frame glass does, in fact, leave Newton Rings on scans. Due to the lack of consensus, I decided to test etched frame glass for myself.\n\nJust like the acrylic, etched frame glass can be found locally. I called a local framing shop and asked if they had \"non-glare glass\", and they replied that they did. I went to pick some up, making sure that the non-glare glass was of the etched kind, as opposed to the optically coated kind (often referred to as non-reflective glass). They could cut the glass to size for me on the spot, and the total cost for two 8x10\" sheets of etched frame glass was only $6, which is **$2 cheaper** than the cost of two 8x10\" sheets of NGA! Things were already looking up.\n\nAfter cleaning the glass with glass cleaner and removing dust with a microfiber cloth, it was time to test the glass. Using etched frame glass is the same process as using the acrylic. The film is placed between the etched side of the two glass sheets and on top of a lightbox.\n\nWhile preparing the glass, one must be very careful to not chip or break it. When placed on a smooth surface, the glass has a tendency to slide because of how smooth it is, and it could slide off a drop if you aren't careful. Use glass at your own risk!\n\nRESULTS:\n\nAfter scanning the same negative through both Non-Glare Acrylic and Etched Frame Glass, I used Lightroom to compare the two images side-by-side. Through close inspection and lots of zooming, I have determined that **etched frame glass produces the same results as NGA**, free of Newton Rings, unwanted texture, and color shifts, at an even cheaper price. There is no noticeable difference in sharpness between the two scans outside of the margin of error of my manual focusing. The grain structure is virtually identical between the two images, proving that neither NGA nor etched frame glass leaves a texture on scans.\n\nAs stated in my previous post, this is not a direct comparison with ANR glass. I have never used ANR glass, but I do not intend to after seeing the results of much cheaper options.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nBased on preference, either non-glare acrylic or etched frame glass will work as a cheap yet quality alternative to ANR glass. Both options have equal sharpness and do not produce Newton Rings. Personally, I prefer etched frame glass and will be using it from now on due to its scratch resistance and rigidity.\n\nPHOTOS:\n\nBoth scans were edited to have as similar color as possible.\n\n[Side-by-side comparison of etched frame glass and non-glare acrylic](https://preview.redd.it/l7420nbnulk71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f2bf5e65d593848166b1d96bc63827c5621de5)\n\n[DSLR scanning setup using etched frame glass](https://preview.redd.it/yf2d260gvlk71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec2d84128f2fde9796c0023889e99d2eed57c035)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/pex269/anr_glass_alternative_using_etched_frame_glass/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "anr glass alternative: using etched frame glass /!/ in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/analogcommunity/comments/pe3xy5/using_nonglare_acrylic_as_an_alternative_to/), i discussed using non-glare acrylic (nga) as an alternative to anti-newton ring glass for film scanning. i found that nga produces beautiful, sharp scans that are free of newton rings, just like anr glass does. this makes nga an economical and easy to source alternative for anr glass.\n\nnga didn't come without its flaws, though. most notably, it was very easy to damage, particularly through scratches. i found that even light cleaning could leave scratches on the acrylic, which reduce scan quality. the acrylic can also become bent and warped over time, which may cause it to not lay flat. glass products, like anr, do not suffer from these drawbacks.\n\non my post about nga, u/nikon-fe made a comment claiming that etched frame glass \"works just like anr glass without the anr tax.\" this seemed likely to be true, considering that nga worked, and it uses a similar textured side to etched frame glass. however, there were also some comments claiming that etched frame glass does, in fact, leave newton rings on scans. due to the lack of consensus, i decided to test etched frame glass for myself.\n\njust like the acrylic, etched frame glass can be found locally. i called a local framing shop and asked if they had \"non-glare glass\", and they replied that they did. i went to pick some up, making sure that the non-glare glass was of the etched kind, as opposed to the optically coated kind (often referred to as non-reflective glass). they could cut the glass to size for me on the -----> spot !!!

There's many reason for this. There's too many anti-maskers in my area to go out in the day time, and my boyfriend can't stand waiting around while I mess with a tripod. I don't love the look of flash, and it's conspicuous on the street. \n\nI wanted to share some of the things I've learned after 9 rolls of film shooting this way. Some people reading this may have more experience than me, and if you do, please correct me where I err and let me know any tips you have, I want to hear. But I know that a lot of photographers avoid shooting this way or don't think it's possible, and there's not an overwhelming amount of information out there about it, so I just wanna offer my perspective, green though it may be.\n\n# Light\n\nLight at night is water in the desert; you have to do everything you can to get it. You have to create a configuration that will soak up light with voracious greed. Big lens, fast film. I use an F 1.4 lens, and Kodak P3200 T-Max and occasionally Ilford Delta 3200. I am experimenting with pushing Portra 800 but I haven't gotten the results back yet so I can't comment on how well it works. A lot of people prefer Delta over T-Max for its midtones, and I think in brighter conditions, they have a strong point. But in very dark conditions, the T-Max really shines. More than just dramatic contrast, it gives things a silvery look I really like, and has a crisp quality in spite of the grain. Plus, I don't necessarily love what happens when you goose the contrast of a Delta photo in post. I say let it be what it is; a beautiful low contrast stock. But I digress. \n\nPart of why you want this level of light gathering ability is so that you don't \"bottom out\" in your exposure. Lenses perform better when they're stopped down at least a little. Shooting anything other than wide-open in these conditions may sound ridiculous, but since focusing in the dark is really difficult and you're moving quickly, a super slim depth-of-field isn't always what you want. The true strength of a 1.4 lens isn't that it opens to 1.4, it's how it looks at F2 compared to an F2 lens. \n\nAlso, you will often want the option to over-expose. Both of these films are fast, but hungry. They are quite happy to eat up some extra light. Attempting to over-expose at night with no flash may sound greedy, but that's what you need to be. \n\nAs I'll go into later, dynamic range can be really high in night scenes. A slower setup might tell you that you're good to click, but the results may disappoint. So you need a buffer, some extra speed in your setup that you don't always need.. \n\n# Film Speed of 3200 Stocks\n\nA lot of people on analog subs like to say that T-Max P3200 and Delta 3200 aren't *really* 3200 speed films. They will tell you that they have ISO ratings of 1600 or lower, so they need to be rated as such. They are correct about the ISO rating, but they are not correct that that means you have to rate the film slower to take good pictures. The ISO rating is a measurement of how the film responds on certain tests, but it is not determined by the taking of pictures, so the ISO rating doesn't necessarily tell you what will look best. Plus, Kodak are trying to give you a clue as to how to use their film. The P in P3200 T-Max stands for \"push\", meaning that *normal* development for this film is technically pushing. But since it's designed to be used that way, it works really well. \n\nI always rate T-Max P3200 at 3200 ISO. Delta 3200 I will rate slower if I'm going to be in brighter light conditions, just because of the lower contrast. Over-exposing Delta 3200 produces a soft, dreamy look imo. But it works perfectly well rated at 3200 for night shoots. \n\n[1.4 Lens, T-Max P3200 at box speed, 1.5 stops of compensation](https://preview.redd.it/uzoyydtqy9e61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def36b163ecb3139803407b7e9beb85bb85167b9)\n\n# Prioritize Shutter Speed\n\nShooting handheld means using a fast shutter speed, but shooting in low light means using the slowest shutter speed you can get away with. These two competing forces mean that there's almost never a reason to use a shutter speed besides the minimum dictated by your lens's focal length. \n\nLonger focal lengths exaggerate handheld shake, shorter focal lengths forgive it more. For the nifty fifty, that means you should never shoot slower than 1/50th of a second.\n\nThe closest setting on my trusty K1000 is 1/60th, so I set it there and leave it there the whole night. All that cash you shelled out on a big lens and ultra-fast films has been to bring this magic number within reach, because this number is the difference between getting the shot, and needing to go home and get a tripod. \n\n(I say \"all that cash\", but fast 50mm prime lenses are fairly affordable.)\n\nOn my K1000, I shoot in de facto shutter priority. And I've begun experimenting with a Canon EOS that has real shutter priority mode. Experience has shown me that a nighttime walk-and-shoot will never give me enough light to justify speeding up the shutter, nor stopping the lens down further than about F4. Plus, if I attempt aperture priority, the risk of the shutter speed dipping below the minimum without me realizing it is too great. So I park it at 60 and go. \n\nIf you're about to do your first ever night shooting, avoid the temptation to speed up the shutter for the sake of bokeh / depth of field. Focusing in low-light is difficult for people and cameras alike. Plus, extreme DOF blur that can look dreamy in the daytime can look muddy in the night time. \n\n[High speed film and shutter priority enabled a wider depth of field](https://preview.redd.it/08ocppkcdae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01b6c71e553f4e18e4f2dd75b2b6c0a62997287d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Compensation\n\nA really fun way to compose pictures at night is to include the light source in the picture. Street lights, shop lights, car headlights, and so on. But this can confuse camera meters, which may attempt to treat the light source as a highlight and try not to blow it out. The result of this is often pictures which have little pin-pricks of light and not much else. Both my K1000 with it's pseudo-averaging and my EOS with it's Evaluative metering behave very similarly at night. Any bright light source will freak the meter out and cause it to under-expose. \n\nSome people are comfortable framing up a scene and then estimating a compensation, but I'm not, so here's what I do:\n\nWith my K1000's match-needle meter, I will aim at my scene, and then aim away until the lights are no longer in the frame, but the area lit by that light still is. At that point, the needle will usually drop significantly. I then set the exposure so that the needle is right down the middle, and then re-frame my composition. The needle will jump up and act like I'm about to over-expose, but it's safe to ignore it. My K1000 is recently calibrated, so you'll need to apply this to what you know about your own camera.\n\nWith my EOS 500, you can technically do the same thing, but it's pretty inconvenient outside of manual mode. Thankfully it has a button on the back that converts from evaluative metering to spot metering. I have tested these techniques on the cameras side-by-side, and the spot-meter button gives the exact same exposure compensation as the look-away method on my K1000 almost every time. \n\n[I exposed this shot exactly as my K1000 suggested, but it was confused by the lights](https://preview.redd.it/1xb60r6o4ae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad40f03926426dc5129cc0a1e748038e7d894a5d)\n\n*Processing img rx79g6lo4ae61...*\n\nWhen in doubt, you can always double-check with a phone app meter. Generally speaking my phone-app meter gives me the same result as these compensation tricks, but obviously you don't wanna be taking out your phone for every shot, you're shooting handheld for speed, right? \n\n# Pushing\n\nYou may not feel like using 3200 speed black and white film. They are slightly more expensive than their 400 speed cousins (though not quite as expensive as Portra) or maybe you want to give this a try using the film you have. When film is pushed, it gets grainier, grittier, and more contrasty. There's not really a way around it. But personally, I like that look, it's a huge reason why I shoot film in the first place. Subconsciously I'm just trying to make the movie Alphaville. \n\nIf you're not familiar, pushing film is a combination of under-exposing and over-developing. You set your meter ISO to the desired speed, and then let your lab know how many stops you \"pushed\" by, and they compensate in development (or you can compensate in your own development, but if you home develop you probably already know all this) \n\nThis is distinct from *rating,* though the terms get tossed around. When you *rate* film, you're just treating the film as if it has a different speed and then developing normally. This is quite commonly done with Portra 400, which people will rate at 200 to feed it more light. But they do not change the development. \n\nWith that out of the way, pushed 400 film behaves fairly similarly to fast film. Higher contrast, more grain, but still quite eager for light. Everything else I've said applies. Maybe a little less tolerance for underexposure, a little less shadow detail. But a totally viable option. \n\n[Kodak Tri-X pushed allllll the way to 3200](https://preview.redd.it/80gryeh18ae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c40ba1f236e9c834d9fee8a08d7079b31861fafa)\n\nThese are the things I have learned about shooting in these tricky circumstances.

"selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "shooting handheld at night (without flash) /!/ since i've gotten into film photography, almost all of my photography has been handheld at night on my pentax k1000 with no flash. there's many reason for this. there's too many anti-maskers in my area to go out in the day time, and my boyfriend can't stand waiting around while i mess with a tripod. i don't love the look of flash, and it's conspicuous on the street. \n\ni wanted to share some of the things i've learned after 9 rolls of film shooting this way. some people reading this may have more experience than me, and if you do, please correct me where i err and let me know any tips you have, i want to hear. but i know that a lot of photographers avoid shooting this way or don't think it's possible, and there's not an overwhelming amount of information out there about it, so i just wanna offer my perspective, green though it may be.\n\n# light\n\nlight at night is water in the desert; you have to do everything you can to get it. you have to create a configuration that will soak up light with voracious greed. big lens, fast film. i use an f 1.4 lens, and kodak p3200 t-max and occasionally ilford delta 3200. i am experimenting with pushing portra 800 but i haven't gotten the results back yet so i can't comment on how well it works. a lot of people prefer delta over t-max for its midtones, and i think in brighter conditions, they have a strong point. but in very dark conditions, the t-max really shines. more than just dramatic contrast, it gives things a silvery look i really like, and has a crisp quality in spite of the grain. plus, i don't necessarily love what happens when you goose the contrast of a delta photo in post. i say let it be what it is; a beautiful low contrast stock. but i digress. \n\npart of why you want this level of light gathering ability is so that you don't \"bottom out\" in your exposure. lenses perform better when they're stopped down at least a little. shooting anything other than wide-open in these conditions may sound ridiculous, but since focusing in the dark is really difficult and you're moving quickly, a super slim depth-of-field isn't always what you want. the true strength of a 1.4 lens isn't that it opens to 1.4, it's how it looks at f2 compared to an f2 lens. \n\nalso, you will often want the option to over-expose. both of these films are fast, but hungry. they are quite happy to eat up some extra light. attempting to over-expose at night with no flash may sound greedy, but that's what you need to be. \n\nas i'll go into later, dynamic range can be really high in night scenes. a slower setup might tell you that you're good to click, but the results may disappoint. so you need a buffer, some extra speed in your setup that you don't always need.. \n\n# film speed of 3200 stocks\n\na lot of people on analog subs like to say that t-max p3200 and delta 3200 aren't *really* 3200 speed films. they will tell you that they have iso ratings of 1600 or lower, so they need to be rated as such. they are correct about the iso rating, but they are not correct that that means you have to rate the

It doesn't have the tactility of shooting on an older fully mechanical camera but it has some really great features. \n\n* Multi-spot metering\n* Great ergonomics &amp; build quality\n* Eye Control AF\n\n*Processing img u2g56wlkt8b61...*\n\n**Compatible with All Canon EF Lenses**\n\nThis is a argument for this camera in and of itself. If you have any EF Canon glass with you DSLR then you don't even need to get any lenses for the EOS 3. They all work natively and flawlessly, including AF and IS, which is pretty great. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Huntington Gardens - EOS 3 Portra 400](https://preview.redd.it/jd43cbzpt8b61.jpg?width=3089&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be08c0063574ceef1fc3cfae14eb196cfbcd25fd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Double Exposure on Ultramax 400](https://preview.redd.it/k5w06eput8b61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf193d2d68b8dbf25a2c2513e0f62afeb6a4e8b0)\n\n**Shutter Sound**\n\nIt's got the classic shutter sound that has been mimicked on early iPhone cameras and other such digital emulations.

I feel that I never really nailed the focus in any of the shots. In fact, it's hard for me to tell where the focal-point is, making it difficult for me to pinpoint what I need to improve. I swear I thought I had the focus down in most shots (the viewfinder makes this quite simple I thought). Most shots were taken with f8 - I guess I need to get used that this is practically an f4 equivalent on my MFT mirrorless system, where handling the range of focus is a bit different. Could it be that the lens is simply \"soft\" or is this a characteristic of 35mm film in general that super-sharp lines are not to be expected or did I just mess up? ;)\n\n2.

Any tips?**\n\nFor the love of God, please look up the manual. They're free (in most cases)! Incredible, isn't it ?\nWhat else do you want ? Just load and shoot already!\n\nAlso check the light seals and shutter functions and other features if you buy from a less-than-genuine looking source.\n\n3.**What film does (popular beginner camera) take ?/My camera has a [enter lens that isn't f=35mm] lens, what film does it take?**\n\nManuals, please look them up...\n\n4.**Why does my photo look like this ?**\n\nFirstly, provide us with the negative/slide! Scanners can leave marks too **which are only present on the scan!**\n\nIs one side overexposed/underexposed while the rest of the picture is normally exposed? Then it's shutter capping which can happen both to vertical and horizontal travelling shutters.\n\nAre there irregular overexposed spots on the negative? Light leaks. If they're white then it's a like from the front, due to a punctured curtain and or dissolving light seals. An orange hue indicates a light leak from the back (color negative film only).\n\nWhy are the images so dark ? Underexposure most likely. This could be due to the cameras meter either being faulty or the meter reading only the brightest part of the frame therefore underexposing the rest of the image.\n\nWhy is there little to no contrast ? Overexposed. As above but probably very heavily overexposed due to metering fault. Generally film handles overexposure better than underexposure.\n\n5.**My negatives came out completely translucent or blank/many translucent frames. What happened ?**\n\nIf your film/frames come out completely translucent/clear then your film has (literally) not seen the light of day. \n\nThis could be due to shutter failure, mirror failure, improper loading (film was not wound correctly on the take-up spool, mostly with 135 film), severe metering fault either due to faulty electronics or forgetting that meter was set at ISO 1600 completely underexposing your 12\u20ac Fuji Velvia by four and a half stops, aperture was too small, a fault with the film (unlikely but can happen), or the lab/you screwed up during development.\n\n6.**My [enter popular electronic camera] doesn't work/turn on/displays anomalous behavior. What do ?**\n\nUnless the error messages/anomalous behavior isn't stated within the manual, and the fresh battery/batteries trick doesn't work, you're most likely dealing with dead electronics. In most cases this non-repairable or the repair costs greatly exceed the market worth of the camera\n\n7.**What film do I start with ?**\n\nGenerally most recommend black and white film but color negative isn't a bad start either.

This is where I need this awesome community's help!\n\nIf you are an analogue photographer who scans their own film, *you* can help out crowdsource a data set of examples of analogue damage. For the purposes of the training, **we need two versions of the same scanned image - one with the dust, scratches and hairs or other such artifacts present, and one which has been repaired** \\- either manually via any image processing software, or by scanning with ICE on. Colour, black and white, slide or negative, 120 or 35mm - everything's accepted.

This means that my research findings and collected data will be released publicly, as that is a condition of my funding. Furthermore, the code will be opensourced, and depending on the successful outcome of the project, I would like to develop a free web-based app where people can have the trained model try and repair their images.

Have some questions and looking for tips to get the most out of this camera! /!/ Hello, thanks for reading. I am beyond excited to start shooting with my new camera and would like to get a few things sorted. I purchased a kit with the AE metering prism, waist level finder and have the 55, 80 and 150mm lenses.\n\nMy first question, I am noticing that when using the mirror lockup with AE prism attached the camera is taking longer exposures than the meter is showing. I am guessing this is because the meter is not seeing the scene as the mirror is up? So I should just set the shutter dial manually to what the meter is showing I am guessing.\n\nSecond, I am mainly interested in landscape shots. I will be using a tripod and taking my time, is there a sweet spot for theses Sekor C lenses for sharpness? I remember watching some videos from medium/large format film photographers and seeing f16/f22 apertures with longer exposures, something I'm not used to coming from digital. I've also heard to not fear stopping down with these cameras, any tips here?\n\nThird, I am noticing my shutter dial has some play 1 stop forward and backwards from where you 'click' it in place. So if I rotate and 'click' it to 1/250, I can turn it from 1/125 to 1/500 freely without any resistance. It still seems to work correctly if I change it ahead or back 1 stop despite not feeling the 'click', just wondering if this is normal.\n\nLastly, I have gone over the camera as best I can to ensure everything is functioning correctly, the shutter speed seems accurate at least for the longer speeds, self timer seems to work, light seals look good, anything else to check before my ebay return window closes?\n\nAny other tips you might have for using this camera I would really appreciate any help!
