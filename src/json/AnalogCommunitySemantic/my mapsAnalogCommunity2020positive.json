Do you buy a cooler once you get to the country, or find some alternative way to keep the film from degrading? I\u2019m curious because I would like to do some extended traveling once the pandemic is well and truly gone, and I like shooting film when I travel because it doesn\u2019t distract me as much from the sights I\u2019m seeing.
