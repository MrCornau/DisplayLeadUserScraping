Some turned out to be useful, some not so much, and some I was just not ready for. Here's my thoughts on the beginner advice I received after a year of practice. \n\n# \"Overexpose your negatives\"\n\nThis advice comes in many flavors, such as, \"You should always rate Portra 400 at 200\", or, \"Delta 3200 is actually 1000 ISO film,\" \"always meter for the shadows with film\", and finally the least broad (but most correct), \"If the light is confusing, it's better to overexpose than underexpose.\" \n\nA year later, and I think I have some idea of why this advice persists. The darling cameras of the Analog Renaissance are mechanical dinosaurs with through-the-lens meters, like my beloved K1000. And if those meters are the only ones you ever use, overexposing all your negatives by one stop may actually seem like sensible advice. That old fashioned meter is trying to make your scene (or more likely the very center of it) a neutral luminance value. Doing this is not a half-bad way to ensure that the scene falls within the dynamic range of your film. \n\nThe problem is, your camera doesn't know what you're pointing it at. It doesn't know the difference between an asphalt driveway and a cumulus cloud, it just wants them both to be exposed right down the middle of your film's dynamic range. But asphalt and clouds aren't supposed to be the same brightness. \n\nThe problem becomes more obvious once you have an incident meter in your hand. An incident meter measures the light *falling onto* a subject, and will recommend an exposure which accurately records the luminance of the subjects, as opposed to reflected light meters that want everything to be neutral gray, a.k.a. Zone V. It doesn't take long to realize that incident readings and reflected readings seldom agree, and often times the incident reading will be brighter. The meter in the trendy old mechanical SLR is trying to tamp down the brightness of the subject to make sure it falls in the film's dynamic range, whereas the incident meter only cares about how well lit things are. When I first started taking incident readings, I was horrified to find that my K1000's meter disagreed with most readings, often indicating overexposure. But experience has taught me to trust incident readings for most situations. \n\nAnd then there are a half-dozen other reasons why you may need a brighter exposure than your camera meter is telling you, like a bright sky, street lamps, reciprocity failure, etc. But when a beginner is asking you how to get some decent shots on her first roll, you don't have time to explain all the kinds of metering, all the situations that require compensation, and what reciprocity failure is. But you know that if she aims to overexpose, most of her shots will probably turn out fine. So that becomes the advice. \"Just overexpose.\" \n\nThe only drawback I see is that some people seem to hold onto this well past their own beginner stage, and keep repeating these things even when they ought to know better. So my revised beginner advice is, \"You're safe overexposing, but set a long-term goal of improving your metering.\" \n\n# \"Don't worry about genre, just take pictures.\"\n\nThis is some of my favorite advice I ever got. I don't remember who told me this, but they said, in a nutshell, \"don't worry about taking street, landscape, architecture, etc. Just take pictures and see what you gravitate towards.\" \n\nWhat can I say? It's exactly what I needed to hear. I started out taking pictures of whatever I happened to find interesting, just like most of us, and over time I have gravitated towards landscapes and still-lifes. So I say, keep this advice going. \n\n# \"(X antique mechanical SLR) is the perfect beginner camera!\" \n\nThere was a time when my beloved Pentax K1000 was a great beginner camera. But camera prices in 2021 are completely upside down. The mechanical dinosaurs (lovely though they are) cost 5, six times as much as the pro quality 90s SLRs, which have way better specs and kickass auto-exposure, but which are unloved because they are plastic and dorky looking. \n\nBut I understand why people continue to recommend Canon F1s and Pentax MEs. Yes, the price is over-inflated due to hype, but part of what you're paying for is simplicity. Not so much simplicity in camera operation, but simplicity in keeping an outdated technology working in 2021. \n\nSuppose I successfully convince someone they should buy a 90s dork SLR instead of a trendy antique. Their very next question would probably be, \"which one?\" But unfortunately the answer to that question requires a bunch of knowledge they probably don't have yet. The closer to the present you get, lens compatibility goes from dead simple to a nightmarish sudoku puzzle. Batteries are a headache, and whereas my K1000 could very well out-live me due to its mechanical innards, my Z1 (equally beloved) will most likely die in my hands and then be destined for the landfill.  \n\nThis is why I think so many guides to beginner cameras just repeat, \"Pentax K1000, Canon AE, Nikon F2\" etc. It's just a lot easier than going, \"maybe a Canon EOS Rebel G? And if you don't see one on eBay, trying searching 'EOS Rebel Kiss', that's the Japanese version. And make sure you get an EF lens if you want auto-focus. Oh wait, you already have a DA lens? That changes everything!\" \n\nIt's ironic, because the cameras withthe best specs are cheaper and easier to find, but harder to confidently buy if you're a beginner. And not nearly as cool looking. \n\n# \"Slide film isn't for beginners, shoot negatives for now.\"\n\nOn the one hand, this is extremely sensible. Slide film is expensive at every single stage, from purchase to processing. And taking pictures with it is one of the most nerve-shreddingly tricky pursuits I've ever taken on. It absolutely makes sense to shoot negative films for a long time-- months, years even-- before attempting slide film. \n\nBut that's not what I did. The first roll I bought was Velvia 50. And I had enough discipline to burn through a couple negative rolls first, but I just couldn't help myself. And most of my exposures were garbage, but a few pictures were salvageable. From that point I've shot roughly one roll of slide film per month. \n\nReflecting on my journey with slide film, I think that diving in was the only way for me. Although I just got through saying how it makes complete sense to practice with the far more forgiving negative film, I don't think there's any adequate preparation for shooting slide. Shooting negatives trains you to expect miles of dynamic range, oodles of exposure latitude, and boundless power to fix things in post. Slide film does not have those things. Shooting negative film trains you to disregard Graduated filters, because they make pale blue skies look garish. But with slide film, they're often necessary to have any sky at all. Basically, if I had followed the advice, if I were only starting to shoot slide film *now,* I'd probably decide it was too difficult and too expensive and I may as well keep going with the negative film I've gathered so much experience with. So I'm glad I didn't listen to good sense, because making slides is one of my favorite parts of photography. \n\n# \"Take pictures for yourself, not for internet points.\"\n\nThis is probably the best advice on this list. It's probably also the hardest to follow. The internet is a strange place. It is an engine, whose boilers are fueled by engagement, which is mined by dopamine inducing UI. Getting some kind of response to what we put out there is the reason we're all here, otherwise the internet would consist of private cloud storage where we all archive our thoughts and creative endeavors which we never bother sharing. \n\nAnd yet, each day we hear the refrain, \"stop caring about internet points!\" Sometimes I think people are a little embarrassed at the affect social media has on them. I know I am. I know that likes and upvotes shouldn't matter, that all my validation should come from within. I know that. And have long contended with the lingering suspicion that my hunger for internet validation amounts to a personal failing. \n\nBut I don't think I'm the only person who feels that way. I don't think I'm alone in craving validation and carrying shame over that craving. And I think this is why people get edgy when you talk openly about disappointment over lack of response to a photo. Sympathizing with the loser who got no upvotes and is salty about it means acknowledging the power upvotes have to light up our monkey brains, and acknowledging that power means facing the possibility that I too might just be another monkey. The truism goes that we are most annoyed in others by what we don't like about ourselves. None of us wants to admit that we care about getting attention, but most of us like positive attention when we get it. This is considered ostentatious and immodest, so we scold ourselves for it. And when other people let the mask slip and reveal how much attention matters to them, we jump on them for it. \n\nOn reddit, especially, people like to think of themselves as free-thinkers, individuals, not easily manipulated. So I think that repeatedly saying, \"take pictures for yourself,\" is not really advice for beginners, but something people say to soothe *themselves* after enduring long periods with acknowledgement. Because it's not very realistic advice. I mean sure, on some level, sometimes I really do believe that I'm taking pictures for myself, Sometimes I really believe that I don't care what other people think of my photography. But when I take a photo that I think is fire, and then there's no response when I post it, I do feel disappointment. And pretending I don't would be dishonest. \n\nHere's how I would amend this advice: Learn your own mind. Learn to notice when you're setting unrealistic expectations for internet points, learn to identify (and forgive yourself for) disappointment, and know that social media tends to like a specific type of attention-grabbing instantly-digestible content, and that might not be where your passions lie. It's okay to want a slice of spotlight sometimes; most people do (reserve suspicion for people who loudly proclaim their indifference towards it). \n\n# \"Don't do (x popular thing that people like)\"\n\nI've interacted with a lot of artistic communities over the years, having gone to music school, then game design school, then brushing the world of sound engineering, visual arts, and now analog photography. And I have to say, the Analog community might be the most envy-poisoned community I've ever interacted with. I mean, I love y'all, but the amount of complaining and sour grapes is like nothing I've ever encountered. \n\n\"Ugh, the entire front page is half-naked women,\" or, \"another basketball hoop? really?\" or, \"Hi, I know you didn't ask for advice, but you should know that using narrow DOF is a crutch, and amateurs will think it looks 'pro' because iPhones can't do it, but the true connoisseurs see it as distasteful. \n\nThat last one is a (slightly exaggerated rendition of) real comment I received. This person's concern was not primarily that opening up the lens would make my photos worse, but rather that ignoramuses who don't know any better would like it for the wrong reasons. I see this kind of comment every time a guitar player ends up on front page of nextfuckinglevel, top few comments are, \"wow\", and then from there it's all bitter musicians complaining that it's all showy extended technique, etc. \n\nThere's a certain type of criticism which boils down to, \"it's bad because the wrong people like it.\" This is why Titanic is the last popular film to win a Best Picture Oscar, and why teenage music lovers (including, regrettably, myself at one time) have lamented being born into the \"wrong generation\". \n\nI can't claim to have gotten over this impulse completely. I still struggle with envy and lack of fulfillment. But I'm happy I'm at least aware of it, and I don't let it control me anymore. \n\nHow do I amend this advice? Some (not all, but some) people in the analog community are more envious than they themselves realize. (See also the above paragraph about people with sour grapes over not getting the spotlight). If they perceive any element of your photo as being a shortcut somehow, some cheap tactic for making the plebs 'ooh' and 'ahh', they'll kindly offer to explain how this thing that people like is actually distasteful, and if you want to be a *real* photographer, you must stop it immediately. Ignore doctrinaires, and murder your own inner doctrinaire with your bare hands before he takes over completely. \n\nAfter a year of taking pictures with film, some advice has been perfect, some an understandable compromise, some downright incorrect, and some is more revealing of the advice giver.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/pqcc29/beginner_advice_1_year_later/",

you're a beginner. and not nearly as cool looking. \n\n# \"slide film isn't for beginners, shoot negatives for now.\"\n\non the one hand, this is extremely sensible. slide film is expensive at every single stage, from purchase to processing. and taking pictures with it is one of the most nerve-shreddingly tricky pursuits i've ever taken on. it absolutely makes sense to shoot negative films for a long time-- months, years even-- before attempting slide film. \n\nbut that's not what i did. the first roll i bought was velvia 50. and i had enough discipline to burn through a couple negative rolls first, but i just couldn't help myself. and most of my exposures were garbage, but a few pictures were salvageable. from that point i've shot roughly one roll of slide film per month. \n\nreflecting on my journey with slide film, i think that diving in was the only way for me. although i just got through saying how it makes complete sense to practice with the far more forgiving negative film, i don't think there's any adequate preparation for shooting slide. shooting negatives trains you to expect miles of dynamic range, oodles of exposure latitude, and boundless power to fix things in post. slide film does not have those things. shooting negative film trains you to disregard graduated filters, because they make pale blue skies look garish. but with slide film, they're often necessary to have any sky at all. basically, if i had followed the advice, if i were only starting to shoot slide film *now,* i'd probably decide it was too difficult and too expensive and i may as well keep going with the negative film i've gathered so much experience with. so i'm glad i didn't listen to good sense, because making slides is one of my favorite parts of photography. \n\n# \"take pictures for yourself, not for internet points.\"\n\nthis is probably the best advice on this list. it's probably also the hardest to follow. the internet is a strange place. it is an engine, whose boilers are fueled by engagement, which is mined by dopamine inducing ui. getting some kind of response to what we put out there is the reason we're all here, otherwise the internet would consist of private cloud storage where we all -----> archive !!!  our thoughts and creative endeavors which we never bother sharing. \n\nand yet, each day we hear the refrain, \"stop caring about internet points!\" sometimes i think people are a little embarrassed at the affect social media has on them. i know i am. i know that likes and upvotes shouldn't matter, that all my validation should come from within. i know that. and have long contended with the lingering suspicion that my hunger for internet validation amounts to a personal failing. \n\nbut i don't think i'm the only person who feels that way. i don't think i'm alone in craving validation and carrying shame over that craving. and i think this is why people get edgy when you talk openly about disappointment over lack of response to a photo. sympathizing with the loser who got no upvotes and is salty about it means acknowledging the power upvotes have to light up our monkey brains, and acknowledging that power means facing the possibility that i too might just be another monkey. the truism goes that we are most annoyed in others by what we don't like about ourselves. none of us wants to admit that we care about getting attention, but most of us like positive attention when we get it. this is considered ostentatious and immodest, so we scold ourselves for it. and when other people let the mask slip and reveal how much attention matters to them, we jump on them for it. \n\non reddit, especially, people like to think of themselves as free-thinkers, individuals, not easily manipulated. so i think that repeatedly saying, \"take pictures for yourself,\" is not really advice for beginners, but something people say to soothe *themselves* after enduring long periods with acknowledgement. because it's not very realistic advice. i mean sure, on some level, sometimes i really do believe that i'm taking pictures for myself, sometimes i really believe that i don't care what other people think of my photography. but when i take a photo that i think is fire, and then there's no response when i post it, i do feel disappointment. and pretending i don't would be dishonest. \n\nhere's how i would amend this advice: learn your own mind. learn to notice when you're setting unrealistic expectations for internet points, learn to identify (and forgive yourself for) disappointment, and know that social media tends to like a specific type of attention-grabbing instantly-digestible content, and that might not be where your passions lie. it's okay to want a slice of spotlight sometimes; most people do (reserve suspicion for people who loudly proclaim their indifference towards it). \n\n# \"don't do (x popular thing that people like)\"\n\ni've interacted with a lot of artistic communities over the years, having gone to music school, then game design school, then brushing the world of sound engineering, visual arts, and now analog photography. and i have to say, the analog community might be the most envy-poisoned community i've ever interacted with. i mean, i love y'all, but the amount of complaining and sour grapes is like nothing i've ever encountered. \n\n\"ugh, the entire front page is half-naked women,\" or, \"another basketball hoop? really?\" or, \"hi, i know you didn't ask for advice, but you should know that using narrow dof is a crutch, and amateurs will think it looks 'pro' because iphones can't do it, but the true connoisseurs see it as distasteful. \n\nthat last one is a (slightly exaggerated rendition of) real comment i received. this person's concern was not primarily that opening up the lens would make my photos worse, but rather that ignoramuses who don't know any better would like it for the wrong reasons. i see this kind of comment every time a guitar player ends up on front page of nextfuckinglevel, top few comments are, \"wow\", and then from there it's all bitter musicians complaining that it's all showy extended technique, etc. \n\nthere's a certain type of criticism which boils down to, \"it's bad because the wrong people like it.\" this is why titanic is the last popular film to win a best picture oscar, and why teenage music lovers (including, regrettably, myself at one time) have lamented being born into the \"wrong generation\". \n\ni can't claim to have gotten over this impulse completely. i still struggle with envy and lack of fulfillment. but i'm happy i'm at least aware of it, and i don't let it control me anymore. \n\nhow do i amend this advice? some (not all, but some) people in the analog community are more envious than they themselves realize. (see also the above paragraph about people with sour grapes over not getting the spotlight). if they perceive any element of your photo as being a shortcut somehow, some cheap tactic for making the plebs 'ooh' and 'ahh', they'll kindly offer to explain how this thing that people like is actually distasteful, and if you want to be a *real* photographer, you must stop it immediately. ignore doctrinaires, and murder your own inner doctrinaire with your bare hands before he takes over completely. \n\nafter a year of taking pictures with film, some advice has been perfect, some an understandable compromise, some downright incorrect, and some is more revealing of the advice giver.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 2768, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 258809, "autor": "TRAINPOSTING", "date": 1611095243000, "content": "Photographers similar to Ralph Gibson? /!/ I really enjoy his composition style\u2014getting up close and using the shapes, lines, curves, textures, and contrasts in everyday environments to create these abstract, minimalist photos.
