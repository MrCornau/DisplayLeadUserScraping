I have 35mm, mf, and lf.  I enjoy film, but the cost of shooting color film for non-art photography is just not worth it for me at this moment.  Also, I cannot bare upgrading my scanning set up from a v600 to be able to get good scans.  Just cant stomach &gt; 500 dollars for old 90s tech.  So, I figure a digital camera would be a good investment.  \n\nThese are requirements:\n1. Can do good scans of 35mm, 6x6, and LF film.\n2. Is smaller, I dont want a bulky DSLR.  I would like at least 35mm quality, with hopefully good low light performance. Flash is a bonus.\n3. Film esque experience. Being able to compose, focus, shoot without fiddling with the screen on the back and clicking things. I tried to use a Fuji rangefinder style camera and it was very confusing.  An optical viewfinder with framelines would be good, or a dslr with manual and automatic focusing?\n\nWhat would the above entail? What kind of price tags am I looking at?
