I found an old negative and compared a ES\\-2 image to a 4000ppi drum scan I had done, and the ES\\-2/D800/60mm combo is definitely not as good \\(there is less detail\\), but it's not as big of a gap as I would have thought.  I want to compare more images before I make any big claims or post anything, but I'd guess a comparable drum scanner number is like 3000\\-3500ppi.  It's kind of apples and oranges though.  \n* With a D800e or D850, you're pushing better/more pixels through the lens and hopefully able to get more detail out.  I'm using the AF\\-S 60mm, but at least according to DXOMark, the older AF\\-D 60mm is slightly sharper stopped down \\(while the AF\\-S is sharper wide open\\) so that might improve things a bit too.  Still, this setup was enough to resolve the grain on Fuji Superia 800, although not enough to quite get the grain on Portra 400 \\(new\\).\n* Also, since this holds the negatives in the air, you don't have to worry about newton rings.\n\n**Holds negatives \\(mostly\\) flat**\n\n* For the least\\-fiddly process, I recommend NOT cutting your film, and running the whole strip through to negative adapter, six at a time.  This is shown in the picture above.  Just slide the negative holder out of the ES2, open it, and move it down the strip by six negatives.\n* Negatives at the end of a strip can be a little warpy in the negative holder, depending on how much of an edge there is for the holder to grab on to, and how curly your film is.  The film I scanned in the picture above has the normal roll curl but very little longitudinal curl.  Since the holder \\(ideally\\) holds negatives on four sides \\(especially if the film isn't cut\\), you get pretty flat film, which is important.  If your negative is a little short and is only being held on three sides, however, you'll have a tough time getting a good image, as the negative will \"cup\" inside the negative holder.\n\n**Easy to blow off dust before scanning**\n\n* Because the film strip is open, it's easy to give each negative a puff with the rocket blower before you take a picture.\n\n**Very fast relative to other scanning options**\n\n* I can get through a 36\\-exposure roll in about five minutes, versus several hours on other scanners.  Having a bright light \\(for fast autofocus\\) helps a lot.\n\n**Macro lens has many uses**\n\n* If you don't already have a macro lens it's a good excuse to get one\n\n**Doesn't take up a lot of space**\n\n* Unlike most other scanners \\-\\- assuming you don't count the DSLR and the lens, but even then.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**C O N S**\n\n**Expensive: $130\\-150 for a few pieces of plastic?**\n\n* Build quality is fine but nothing to rave about.\n* There are other ways to DSLR scan without attaching the negative directly to the camera, most of which are probably cheaper, and even [cheaper ways](http://blog.photocase.com/2015/02/20/how-to-scan-film-negatives-and-slides-faster-without-a-scanner/) to build a similar device. \n* That said, I made several attempts at making my own tube setup like this with limited success \\- mainly, alignment is difficult and requires fairly precise tolerances.  I spent several hours and maybe $50 on sewer pipe, plexiglass, glue, etc. trying to make my own.  The images were decent and comparable to the ES\\-2, but scanning was slower and it was more difficult to blow dust off.  \n\n**Limited to only three Nikon lenses**\n\n* Requires a full frame body \\+ 60mm AF\\-S Micro or 60mm AF\\-D Micro, or a crop\\-frame body \\+ 40mm AF\\-S Micro\n* If you have a different brand of lens with the same 1:1 macro working distance \\(or \\~0.67:1 for crop frame cameras\\) as one of the three supported lenses, you could probably use this fine, assuming you have the right size filter thread or some step\\-up/down rings. You could also use spacer rings \\(not extension tubes\\) to achieve the right working distance.  Don't forget to account for your step\\-up/down rings in your working distance measurements.\n* The end of the ES\\-2 has a set screw for rotation, but it also lets you adjust the working distance by about a 15mm range.  This is helpful for getting good autofocus results and positioning the negative right at the 1:1 focus point.\n* The working distances that the ES\\-2 Kit supports are roughly \\~37\\-52mm \\(the 52mm filter threads built into the ES\\-2, designed to be used with the 40mm macro on crop frame\\) \\~47\\-62mm \\(62mm filter threads on the supplied step\\-up ring, designed for 60mm AF\\-S\\) or \\~71\\-86mm \\(also 62mm, a bigger step up ring, for the 60mm AF\\-D\\).  I measured from the film plane to the beginning of the filter threads, so keep in mind these working distance ranges are NOT exact but should be pretty close.\n\n**Requires a bright light for ease of use and good results**\n\n* I am using a [5000\\-lumen LED shop light](https://www.homedepot.com/p/PowerSmith-50-Watt-5000-Lumens-Portable-LED-Work-Light-PWL1150BS/300640804), which allows me to get about ISO 100, f/8, 1/250 when the front of the lens is about 100mm from the front of the light.  A less bright light, or using a flash instead, would make focusing on the negative more difficult, and may result in either introducing camera shake issues with slower shutter speeds, too\\-thin depth

"AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "positioning", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "nikon es-2 review (nikon's new dslr scanning accessory) /!/ i picked up one of these at my local camera shop since i already had a nikon 60mm macro lens.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/74amoisd54w01.jpg\n\nhere are the pros and cons in my view.\n\n**p r o s**\n\n**image quality is good \\(but highly camera\\- and lens\\-dependent\\)**\n\n* for the d800 \\(not d800e\\) the images are pretty good.  i found an old negative and compared a es\\-2 image to a 4000ppi drum scan i had done, and the es\\-2/d800/60mm combo is definitely not as good \\(there is less detail\\), but it's not as big of a gap as i would have thought.  i want to compare more images before i make any big claims or post anything, but i'd guess a comparable drum scanner number is like 3000\\-3500ppi.  it's kind of apples and oranges though.  \n* with a d800e or d850, you're pushing better/more pixels through the lens and hopefully able to get more detail out.  i'm using the af\\-s 60mm, but at least according to dxomark, the older af\\-d 60mm is slightly sharper stopped down \\(while the af\\-s is sharper wide open\\) so that might improve things a bit too.  still, this setup was enough to resolve the grain on fuji superia 800, although not enough to quite get the grain on portra 400 \\(new\\).\n* also, since this holds the negatives in the air, you don't have to worry about newton rings.\n\n**holds negatives \\(mostly\\) flat**\n\n* for the least\\-fiddly process, i recommend not cutting your film, and running the whole strip through to negative adapter, six at a time.  this is shown in the picture above.  just slide the negative holder out of the es2, open it, and move it down the strip by six negatives.\n* negatives at the end of a strip can be a little warpy in the negative holder, depending on how much of an edge there is for the holder to grab on to, and how curly your film is.  the film i scanned in the picture above has the normal roll curl but very little longitudinal curl.  since the holder \\(ideally\\) holds negatives on four sides \\(especially if the film isn't cut\\), you get pretty flat film, which is important.  if your negative is a little short and is only being held on three sides, however, you'll have a tough time getting a good image, as the negative will \"cup\" inside the negative holder.\n\n**easy to blow off dust before scanning**\n\n* because the film strip is open, it's easy to give each negative a puff with the rocket blower before you take a picture.\n\n**very fast relative to other scanning options**\n\n* i can get through a 36\\-exposure roll in about five minutes, versus several hours on other scanners.  having a bright light \\(for fast autofocus\\) helps a lot.\n\n**macro lens has many uses**\n\n* if you don't already have a macro lens it's a good excuse to get one\n\n**doesn't take up a lot of space**\n\n* unlike most other scanners \\-\\- assuming you don't count the dslr and the lens, but even then.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**c o n s**\n\n**expensive: $130\\-150 for a few pieces of plastic?**\n\n* build quality is fine but nothing to rave about.\n* there are other ways to dslr scan without attaching the negative directly to the camera, most of which are probably cheaper, and even [cheaper ways](http://blog.photocase.com/2015/02/20/how-to-scan-film-negatives-and-slides-faster-without-a-scanner/) to build a similar device. \n* that said, i made several attempts at making my own tube setup like this with limited success \\- mainly, alignment is difficult and requires fairly precise tolerances.  i spent several hours and maybe $50 on sewer pipe, plexiglass, glue, etc. trying to make my own.  the images were decent and comparable to the es\\-2, but scanning was slower and it was more difficult to blow dust off.  \n\n**limited to only three nikon lenses**\n\n* requires a full frame body \\+ 60mm af\\-s micro or 60mm af\\-d micro, or a crop\\-frame body \\+ 40mm af\\-s micro\n* if you have a different brand of lens with the same 1:1 macro working distance \\(or \\~0.67:1 for crop frame cameras\\) as one of the three supported lenses, you could probably use this fine, assuming you have the right size filter thread or some step\\-up/down rings. you could also use spacer rings \\(not extension tubes\\) to achieve the right working distance.  don't forget to account for your step\\-up/down rings in your working distance measurements.\n* the end of the es\\-2 has a set screw for rotation, but it also lets you adjust the working distance by about a 15mm range.  this is helpful for getting good autofocus results and -----> positioning !!!  the negative right at the 1:1 focus point.\n* the working distances that the es\\-2 kit supports are roughly \\~37\\-52mm \\(the 52mm filter threads built into the es\\-2, designed to be used with the 40mm macro on crop frame\\) \\~47\\-62mm \\(62mm filter threads on the supplied step\\-up ring, designed for 60mm af\\-s\\) or \\~71\\-86mm \\(also 62mm, a bigger step up ring, for the 60mm af\\-d\\).  i measured from the film plane to the beginning of the filter threads, so keep in mind these working distance ranges are not exact but should be pretty close.\n\n**requires a bright light for ease of use and good results**\n\n* i am using a [5000\\-lumen led shop light](https://www.homedepot.com/p/powersmith-50-watt-5000-lumens-portable-led-work-light-pwl1150bs/300640804), which allows me to get about iso 100, f/8, 1/250 when the front of the lens is about 100mm from the front of the light.  a less bright light, or using a flash instead, would make focusing on the negative more difficult, and may result in either introducing camera shake issues with slower shutter speeds, too\\-thin depth of field with larger apertures, or noise issues with high isos\\).\n\n**like all dslr scanning, color correction and
