I know this sub isn't typically very repair-focused, but I'm curious to find out if there are people here into camera repair. I've done a bit myself just for fun and have gotten myself into probably the most extreme repair you can do to a lens: re-cementing a doublet.\n\nI have a Mamiya RB67 127mm C lens that I bought cheap with a body (which was also broken, but I have mostly fixed). Unfortunately the lens is cloudy between a cemented doublet. It's a nice lens, but a pro repair would cost more than it's worth so I've decided to embark on fixing it myself.\n\nI took a dremel to the aluminum lip keeping the doublet in place and managed to get the pair out. Looking at it I can absolutely confirm that the haze is between the elements and is not just clear yellowing like from Thorium - it has a weird spotted pattern.\n\nThe two elements are very much still glued together, presumably with UV curing epoxy (as opposed to Canada Balsam). Basically there are four things I need to figure out:\n\n* **How to de-cement the doublet**. I've read various sources suggesting paint stripper, methylene chloride, and acetone, among others. Anyone have ideas?\n\n* **What cement to use**. Would I be crazy to use Canada Balsam? It seems like the easiest thing... If not, what epoxy?\n\n* **How to align the elements**. I don't have a collimator. Will some sort of machined angle-holders actually be good enough? What are the consequences of being off-kilter a bit?\n\n* **How to fix the doublet back in it's housing**. I cut it out so I'll need another solution to get it back in. Is glass-metal glue a bad idea?
