Lee on behalf of Kapella, a British Design firm which granted the rights to Taylor, Taylor-Hobson ; worth noting, the description in the British application form quotes an aperture of f 1,4 ! but a focal lenght of 1\"... probably specs achievable for a cine lens. An optical patent will choose a focal length as example, usually 1\" in British patent or 100mm in German Patent, but that patent do not limit to that focal length only. Such as Leica patents of Xenon (DE647830) and Hektor (DE585456), they all have 100mm in patent document, but actual products are 5cm/1.5 and 7.3cm/1.9 respectively. I have read some physic journal papers, filed by H.W. Lee during 1924 to 1935, Lee always described himself came from \"Research Department, Taylor, Taylor and Hobson\". All those optical designs in science papers were marked as \"Tayor-Hobson (H.W.Lee)\". It is clearly that Lee worked for TTH over decades and designed those lenses under TTH. \ud83d\ude0a Xenon, as you said, is only a commercial trade name. The name \"Xenon\" can be tracked back to late 1920s in Schneider's list, years before Leica announced Xenon 5cm. There were lots lenses named Xenon in different designs.

Lee on behalf of Kapella, a British Design firm which granted the rights to Taylor, Taylor-Hobson ; worth noting, the description in the British application form quotes an aperture of f 1,4 ! but a focal lenght of 1\"... probably specs achievable for a cine lens. An optical patent will choose a focal length as example, usually 1\" in British patent or 100mm in German Patent, but that patent do not limit to that focal length only. Such as Leica patents of Xenon (DE647830) and Hektor (DE585456), they all have 100mm in patent document, but actual products are 5cm/1.5 and 7.3cm/1.9 respectively.
