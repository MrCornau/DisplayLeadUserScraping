I will try the Skopar and the Milich (?) adapter (though I find I usually need a very small amount of density vignetting to hold an image together). I don't know why people don't understand the contrast issue with regard to digital cameras because it's fairly obvious in the seeing. A decade or two ago, we were still always fighting for more contrast in the camera end of the process, or at least I was. I think this was because of the latitude of negative film and because lens flare and flat light were so often a problem--and we didn't have PS with its huge array of controls to raise contrast selectively (but not so easily lower it). Simply increasing a paper grade or two solved the overall contrast problem but introduced new local problems that were very difficult to handle without the highly selective tools we have now. Today lens contrast (but not flare control) is mostly a liability. On this issue, too, Leica is way behind the times and they have an entire line of otherwise good lenses that is borderline unsuitable for digital photography. It's as if they are still trying to excel in solving a 1980 issue. And, yes, you are right, I do confuse DOF with sharpness and I forget that I am doing that. Thanks for the reminder. On Mitch's comment about innovation, this was really the point of my original post, though you made it much more succintly. Leica was, at one time, an innovator and I guess I was expecting that of the M8. Your post made me realize that Leica didn't at all go into the M8 project to make an innovative \"Leica class\" digital camera. They went into it to try to squeeze out a little more viability and salability from the M camera -- heavy, soft brass top and bottom plates and all. It's as if they were dragged kicking and screaming into a digital camera by technological and market forces they could no longer resist. If they had come from a creative position instead of a reactive one, they might have made a camera like the GR-D but three times the size and with a rangefinder, M mount and some other innovations that I can't even imagine, but they as camera designers should be thinking about.

It\u2019s a very impressive piece of machining. This picture is with the LCD display removed, the shutter speed dial dismantled, the power switch partially dismantled, the shutter release switch removed and the circuit board unsoldered from the hot shoe connections. There are three screws underneath the circuit board securing the hot shoe. It is also glued in with silicone sealant which may be to improve weather proofing, provide additional insulation from possible high voltages on the hot shoe contact or discourage tampering with the serial number. The circuit board is actually soldered to the 4 hot-shoe contacts and the fourth mounting screw (top right) makes for a direct ground connection which will help avoid any ill-effects of using a flash with a high voltage trigger. --img--  Looking at the circuit board you can see: A contact pattern for the shutter speed dial, the power switch is similar. There are 33 possible positions of the shutter speed dial and a rotating contact connects one or more of the patches to ground at each position. By looking at which contacts are connected to ground, the microprocessor can figure out the selected shutter speed. The board uses a Philips (now NXP) technology called I-squared C (I2C) which uses a serial interface to connect the circuitry to the microprocessor. Here, there\u2019s an I2C LCD display driver (bottom right) and an 8 bit port expander (bottom left). The shutter speed dial requires 6 data bits to specify its 33 possible positions, the power switch 2 bits and the shutter release 2 bits. If, for example, the 8 bit port expander was used for the power switch and the shutter speed dial, a single pair of serial data and clock lines could provide the complete interface to read the power switch and shutter speed dial and support the LCD display. The port expander used can also interrupt the micro when an input changes which avoids the need to have the software repeatedly scanning for data change. This may also be used as part of the wake-up sequence when the camera is turned on or the shutter release pressed. A high voltage transistor (the black component to the left of the hot shoe connections) connects directly to the hot shoe centre contact. It\u2019s this which fires the flash under control of the microprocessor, not the old fashioned electrical contact linked to the physical shutter. The flex print, bottom left connects the top to the rest of the camera and its 13 connections provide the following interface: - Power for the top of the camera - Flash trigger - Flash SCA bi-directional communications - LCD functionality - Status of the Shutter Speed Dial, Power Switch and Shutter Release - Wake-Up Interrupt To be clear, the power switch here is not actually interrupting power to the camera, it\u2019s signalling instead to the microprocessor to start up/shutdown the camera.

There\u2019s another position sensor on the reverse side so that the micro can tell if the shutter is locked or not. In operation, as the shutter is cocked, the armature moves towards to solenoid and sticks because the core is a permanent magnet. Under microprocessor control, a current is passed through the solenoid to release it. It was said the that the change to the shutter noise in V1.092 firmware was because this lock is released earlier in the shutter release cycle and becomes audible as a separate event. The shutter is cocked using a small motor made by a Japanese manufacturer, Namiki, and a finely engineered gear train which turns the cam. The profile of the cam has, apparently been tailored to provide the best action with the shutter. In this picture, you can see the complete shutter cocking motor, shutter lock and control electronics. --img--  With some unsoldering, I\u2019ve removed the circuit and unfolded it: --img--  I tried running the motor directly from a 3v battery and, outside the camera, it is much quieter than when inside.
