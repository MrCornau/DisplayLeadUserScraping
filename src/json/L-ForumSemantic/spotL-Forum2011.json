Only a photographer would know how a perceptible pre-flash would ruin a shot. Let's face it, some genius designer came up with the utterly worthless red eye reduction! So here's my conclusion. If you need to shoot people photos with the M9 and flash on the camera and don't want to have them blinking, don't use TTL with the M9. Other techniques (off camera) and methods (auto mode) seem to work better. I'm just trying to put this out there so that when the next person finds this thread while trying to decide whether to buy this flash, and what it is capable of will have the information. I am not a guy who spends a lot of time reading or posting on forums, I just go when I need information. The TTL is not working for me. Whether it works for you depends on your expectations and the way you work. Mike Mike, I don't think, somebody let the intern design the Leica variant of TTL flashes or the cameras circuitry, to communicate. We are talking about Metz, a company, which does flash for quite a time and Leica, a renowned lens, camera and fashion maker, not Sony. The way, I see the lack in the Leica flashes, compared to Canon and Nikon products is just this: flash is an afterthought in development for the Leica M. Not the majority of Leica M users uses flash, if TTL flash at all. Flash has no priority. For Canon and Nikon, flash is essential. The pro cameras, which are sold to big extends to professional users as journalists, sports shooters and alike need the best performance out of strobes - there is a strong market need AND A RACE between the two companies, to improve their already market leading performance. Why should Leica pair with Metz and compete with the performance of Canon and Nikon with flash? It is not Leica's main market. That time was in the 50's. And even back then, the M was not the big rig, to shoot with bulbs (it could be done, and some did), but it's reason of being was small size, but excellent quality on the negative paired with simple operation. The people, who might want to use TTL flash opposed to manual or Auto flash want a quick shot, be it out of convenience or out of quick changing lighting conditions. It is like it is and the SF58 is the best solution, if one needs TTL on a Leica (the only others being a set of Metz items or the SF24D). I use Nikon and love the simple fully automated and spot on Nikon metering and TTL flash, when I want it (again: convenience for me) or the excellent ergonomics, when needed in manual modes (product shots). I bought the SF58, to expand the poor low light performance of the M8.2 sensor, to use lower ISO in very dark scenes.
