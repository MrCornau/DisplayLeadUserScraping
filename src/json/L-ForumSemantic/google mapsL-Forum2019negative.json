I was using LR on the iPad for the last ~18 months, and I found it very frustrating. A minor inconvenience was that there's no real way to cull photos before you import them into LR. And with lots of files, LR was crawling, despite lots of free memory on my iPad Pro. For me the bigger issue was that LR Mobile only syncs directly with LR CC on the Mac. And LR CC just isn't my cup of tea. My biggest complaint is that you cannot print directly from LR CC, and since I don't typically post photos online, printing is my preferred output. You can sync your libraries from LR CC to LR CC Classic, but that is a very clunky, and incredibly slow, process.

So to sum up, I'm managing all photos in the Apple Photos libraries, and for the few selects that I want to process and print, I export DNGs and put them in a Capture One library and edit and print from there. Also, when I can I use PhotoMechanic to do initial culling, so that I can weed out the bad shots before they ever hit the Photos library.
