If you draw an object say a face by putting in a nose, mouth, eyes or fruit by drawing the shape of a banana or apple you are seeing \u2018object base\u2019. If you draw a face by drawing a common shape of light covering part of the nose and mouth or part of the apple and banana, you are seeing tonally.

This requires the eye to observe differently and there are a number of progressive exercises which cements this way of seeing. Realistic painters do not have the photographers post production tool nor the ability to switch from a colour to a b/w film - they just have their eyes and so have to develop a more meaningful way of seeing.

(Another set of graphs on the photonstophotos website bears this out in showing that the M10 has significantly more shadow recovery than the M10-R: look at the Photographic Dynamic Range Shadow Improvement graphs.) That \"blown highlights...are gone\" with the M10-R is clearly an overstatement: they could possibly be \"gone\" only if one if one never were to shoot into the light or with strong sidelight \u2014 even negative B&W film will sometime blow the highlights if the light in such conditions is strong. As to there being \"absolutely no downside\" to the M10-R: that has been dealt with in earlier statements about the limitations on handhold shooting, even at shutter speed of 1/250 and 1/125 seconds... ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 9570, "searchterm": "artificial intelligence", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['hour', 'ago', 'setuporg', 'blow', 'highlight', 'achilles', 'foot', 'leica', 'absolutely', 'downside', 'minute', 'ago', 'budjame', 'slight', 'increase', 'dynamic', 'range', 'welcome', 'understand', 'fully', 'people', 'buy', 'forgive', 'bit', 'skepticism', 'claim', 'great', 'dynamic', 'range', 'photonstophoto', 'net', 'dynamic', 'range', 'graph', 'dynamic', 'range', 'essentially', 'minuscule', 'advantage', 'actually', 'highlight', 'major', 'achievement', 'leica', 'able', 'despite', 'high', 'pixel', 'density', 'small', 'pixel', 'size', 'think', 'virtually', 'dynamic', 'range', 'distribution', 'range', 'different', 'respective', 'dngs', 'contrast', 'curve', 'apply', 'firmware', 'allocate', 'large', 'proportion', 'available', 'dynamic', 'range', 'shadow', 'tone', 'highlight', 'large', 'proportion', 'highlight', 'shadow', 'people', 'find', 'sooc', 'render', 'highlight', 'word', 'shoot', 'light', 'strong', 'sidelight', 'underexpose', 'lift', 'post', 'set', 'graph', 'photonstophotos', 'website', 'bear', 'significantly', 'shadow', 'recovery', 'look', 'photographic', 'dynamic', 'range', 'shadow', 'improvement', 'graph', 'blow', 'highlight', 'clearly', 'overstatement', 'possibly', 'shoot', 'light', 'strong', 'sidelight', 'negative', 'film', 'blow', 'highlight', 'light', 'condition', 'strong', 'absolutely', 'downside', 'deal', 'early', 'statement', 'limitation', 'handhold', 'shooting', 'shutter', 'speed', 'second', 'frog', 'leaping', 'photobook']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9952}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": "Sentiment(polarity=0.1374007936507937, subjectivity=0.4619047619047617)", "Emotion": "surprise", "temp_list": null, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 72, "Relevance": 45.67, "content": "I will definitely get a CLA on it.

First, the photonstophotos.net dynamic range graphs show that the dynamic range is essentially the same, with a minuscule advantage to the M10 \u2014 and this actually highlights the major achievement of Leica with the M10-R \u2014 to be able to do that despite the higher pixel density and smaller pixel size of the M10-R. I think that, while the M10-R and the M10 have virtually the same dynamic range, the distribution of this range is different in the respective DNGs: the contrast curve applied by the firmware in the M10 allocates a larger proportion of the available dynamic range to shadow tones than to highlights, while the M10-R gives a larger proportions to the highlights than to the shadows. This is why people are finding, SOOC, that the M10-R renders the highlights better than the M10: in other words, when shooting into the light, or with strong sidelight, one doesn't have to underexpose (and lift shows in post) as much with the M10-R as with the M10. (Another set of graphs on the photonstophotos website bears this out in showing that the M10 has significantly more shadow recovery than the M10-R: look at the Photographic Dynamic Range Shadow Improvement graphs.) That \"blown highlights...are gone\" with the M10-R is clearly an overstatement: they could possibly be \"gone\" only if one if one never were to shoot into the light or with strong sidelight \u2014 even negative B&W film will sometime blow the highlights if the light in such conditions is strong. As to there being \"absolutely no downside\" to the M10-R: that has been dealt with in earlier statements about the limitations on handhold shooting, even at shutter speed of 1/250 and 1/125 seconds... ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 9570, "searchterm": "artificial intelligence", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['hour', 'ago', 'setuporg', 'blow', 'highlight', 'achilles', 'foot', 'leica', 'absolutely', 'downside', 'minute', 'ago', 'budjame', 'slight', 'increase', 'dynamic', 'range', 'welcome', 'understand', 'fully', 'people', 'buy', 'forgive', 'bit', 'skepticism', 'claim', 'great', 'dynamic', 'range', 'photonstophoto', 'net', 'dynamic', 'range', 'graph', 'dynamic', 'range', 'essentially', 'minuscule', 'advantage', 'actually', 'highlight', 'major', 'achievement', 'leica', 'able', 'despite', 'high', 'pixel', 'density', 'small', 'pixel', 'size', 'think', 'virtually', 'dynamic', 'range', 'distribution', 'range', 'different', 'respective', 'dngs', 'contrast', 'curve', 'apply', 'firmware', 'allocate', 'large', 'proportion', 'available', 'dynamic', 'range', 'shadow', 'tone', 'highlight', 'large', 'proportion', 'highlight', 'shadow', 'people', 'find', 'sooc', 'render', 'highlight', 'word', 'shoot', 'light', 'strong', 'sidelight', 'underexpose', 'lift', 'post', 'set', 'graph', 'photonstophotos', 'website', 'bear', 'significantly', 'shadow', 'recovery', 'look', 'photographic', 'dynamic', 'range', 'shadow', 'improvement', 'graph', 'blow', 'highlight', 'clearly', 'overstatement', 'possibly', 'shoot', 'light', 'strong', 'sidelight', 'negative', 'film', 'blow', 'highlight', 'light', 'condition', 'strong', 'absolutely', 'downside', 'deal', 'early', 'statement', 'limitation', 'handhold', 'shooting', 'shutter', 'speed', 'second', 'frog', 'leaping', 'photobook']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9952}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": null, "Emotion": null, "temp_list": null, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 72, "Relevance": 45.67, "content": "I will definitely get a CLA on it.
