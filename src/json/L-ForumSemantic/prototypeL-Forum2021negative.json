The label had the Verk. Nr. and the Fabr.Nr. which I believe are the work order number and the production serial number. Fabr.Nr. was the same as the serial number on the camera body but with a leading 0. On the far right end of the label was the stamped date. The serial number and the date seem to coincide with the previous number sequencing I've researched in the past.
