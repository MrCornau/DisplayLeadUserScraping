I\u2019m so confused right now because literal sly don\u2019t know which way to go... For me these are tools that should serve the final purpose of helping you materialize your vision and what you want to produce. I believed that the M could add value to me, and even create a powerful tandem with the Q already have. But... there can\u2019t be no flows, and the most important ones have to do with the image quality overall. I have so many doubts with M Vs. Q that it\u2019s shocking for me that others with same experience (both systems or cameras) don\u2019t worry about: - The auto WB seems to be way worse in M. Really sucks. This slows you down later is source of unnecessary headaches - If you frame same scene with same exposure settings manually, somehow the Q delivers a much more luminous result, brighter and with the highlights under much better control - Starting at 1600 ISO and above the Q delivers way better detail, and quality - The raw files seems to be \u201cdifficult\u201d to digest for Lr, compared to Q which just fly. I can\u2019t explain why... - The light meter is literally impossible (to me) to understand... I believed the classic Leica is center weighted but I have people telling it\u2019s actually spot... weird, anyway, it seems to be very sensitive to small changes in frame. That translates in difficulty to anticipate... ending up in manual of course - My M-P focus mechanism is off by at least 1-2cm. LV makes it easy to verify this. I can\u2019t tell if this is because of the use of Voigtlander 40mm and perhaps would be accurate using a Leica lens - I\u2019d love if anyone has a M240 raw file with a summicron/summilux/ summarit and can send it over for me to see differences...

I have yet to clean my sensor and am rather apprehensive about doing so! @howiebrou, This is not official sensor cleaning doctrine from anyone or from any manufacturer; it is just the method I use and is based on sensor cleaning instructions found in the M-P 240 manual and the instructions that come with the swabs and cleaning fluid I use. I have had 100% positive results with 0% problems as a result of using this cleaning technique. I seem to need to clean my sensor about once every 6-9 months. I clean my sensor when multiple dust specks show up in post processing that require an annoying amount of time and work to clone over, not every time a spot or two turns up in post. This description is from a blog post that I wrote for my website; I hope this will shed some light on the sensor cleaning process (we are actually cleaning the protective glass cover, not the sensor itself) for you and others. Quote Digital cameras have sensors; unless your camera has a built in dust reduction system, sooner or later your sensor will need to be cleaned - it's inevitable. Then what?? It's a lot quicker, easier and less costly to do it yourself - if you follow your camera manual instructions exactly and are careful, you can successfully clean your camera's sensor yourself. A lot of photographers fear damaging their sensor and will do about anything to avoid cleaning it themselves. However, there is no reason to be afraid to do this procedure yourself, provided you do it properly. You will need the right sensor cleaning supplies - I use Eclipse Optic Cleaning Fluid and Photosol Sensorswab Ultra sensor cleaning swabs. If your camera has a full frame (24x36mm ) sensor, you will need the Type 3 swabs; they are 24 mm wide, as is your sensor. APS-C and smaller sensors will need smaller swabs. Photosol's website has information that will help you determine which swab is right for your camera. One of the most important factors in successful sensor cleaning is to perform this procedure in a clean, dust free environment. Not many of us have access to a clean room such as computer manufacturers build computers in. If your home has airborne dust issues you will need to clean your sensor in an environment where dust is less of a problem (you can check for airborne dust by looking through the beam of a bright flashlight at night; if you see a lot of dust particles dancing in the air, you should probably go elsewhere to clean your sensor). Where would that be? Try a museum or a library; find a spot away from frequent foot traffic, entries and exits and away from heating and cooling ducts that will cause airflow that will stir up any dust that may be present.. Another important point is this - do not use compressed air (\"canned air\") to blow dust from your sensor before cleaning. Canned air can spray liquid propellant onto your sensor cover glass, something you do not want to happen. That liquid can also get behind the sensor and into the electronic components of your camera. If that happens, you are in for a serious repair bill. Instead of canned air, use a blower bulb like the Giottos Rocket Blaster, which will safely remove loose dust particles from your sensor. Also, do not blow dust from your sensor using your breath, as you can spray tiny droplets of saliva into the camera. The sensor swabs I use are dry, which means I need to apply the proper cleaning fluid to them before use. Too much cleaning fluid can damage the electronics inside your camera, so proceed with caution. I have found that five drops on the 24mm wide swabs my camera requires is sufficient (three drops on one side, two on the opposite side, equally spaced across the width of the swab); I would be comfortable using two drops per side, but no more than five drops for a 24 mm wide swab. Again, follow the directions that come with your swabs and cleaning fluid to the letter. Each camera has a specific procedure for sensor cleaning; if you precisely adhere to the instructions in your camera manual, you should have a successful sensor cleaning result. If there are still spots on your sensor after cleaning, you can re-clean the sensor provided your camera manual does not advise against doing so (I once ended up with an eyelash on my sensor that required two cleanings to remove; the first try simply moved it closer to the center of the sensor; this happens sometimes). If you follow the directions in your camera manual and in your swab and cleaning fluid to the letter, you should have no problems cleaning your sensor at home (or at your local museum or library, if need be). DISCLAIMER 1: The above description of sensor cleaning is simply a description of how I clean my sensor; it is not intended as training or professional advice in sensor cleaning. 2: Always follow the directions in your camera manual and in your sensor cleaning materials to the letter.

i have yet to clean my sensor and am rather apprehensive about doing so! @howiebrou, this is not official sensor cleaning doctrine from anyone or from any manufacturer; it is just the method i use and is based on sensor cleaning instructions found in the m-p 240 manual and the instructions that come with the swabs and cleaning fluid i use. i have had 100% positive results with 0% problems as a result of using this cleaning technique. i seem to need to clean my sensor about once every 6-9 months. i clean my sensor when multiple dust specks show up in post processing that require an annoying amount of time and work to clone over, not every time a -----> spot !!!  or two turns up in post. this description is from a blog post that i wrote for my website; i hope this will shed some light on the sensor cleaning process (we are actually cleaning the protective glass cover, not the sensor itself) for you and others. quote digital cameras have sensors; unless your camera has a built in dust reduction system, sooner or later your sensor will need to be cleaned - it's inevitable. then what?? it's a lot quicker, easier and less costly to do it yourself - if you follow your camera manual instructions exactly and are careful, you can successfully clean your camera's sensor yourself. a lot of photographers fear damaging their sensor and will do about anything to avoid cleaning it themselves. however, there is no reason to be afraid to do this procedure yourself, provided you do it properly. you will need the right sensor cleaning supplies - i use eclipse optic cleaning fluid and photosol sensorswab ultra sensor cleaning swabs. if your camera has a full frame (24x36mm ) sensor, you will need the type 3 swabs; they are 24 mm wide, as is your sensor. aps-c and smaller sensors will need smaller swabs. photosol's website has information that will help you determine which swab is right for your camera. one of the most important factors in successful sensor cleaning is to perform this procedure in a clean, dust free environment. not many of us have access to a clean room such as computer manufacturers build computers in. if your home has airborne dust issues you will need to clean your sensor in an environment where dust is less of a problem (you can check for airborne dust by looking through the beam of a bright flashlight at night; if you see a lot of dust particles dancing in the air, you should probably go elsewhere to clean your sensor). where would that be? try a museum or a library; find a spot away from frequent foot traffic, entries and exits and away from heating and cooling ducts that will cause airflow that will stir up any dust that may be present.. another important point is this - do not use compressed air (\"canned air\") to blow dust from your sensor before cleaning. canned air can spray liquid propellant onto your sensor cover glass, something you do not want to happen. that liquid can also get behind the sensor and into the electronic components of your camera. if that happens, you are in for a serious repair bill. instead of canned air, use a blower bulb like the giottos rocket blaster, which will safely remove loose dust particles from your sensor. also, do not blow dust from your sensor using your breath, as you can spray tiny droplets of saliva into the camera. the sensor swabs i use are dry, which means i need to apply the proper cleaning fluid to them before use. too much cleaning fluid can damage the electronics inside your camera, so proceed with caution. i have found that five drops on the 24mm wide swabs my camera requires is sufficient (three drops on one side, two on the opposite side, equally spaced across the width of the swab); i would be comfortable using two drops per side, but no more than five drops for a 24 mm wide swab. again, follow the directions that come with your swabs and cleaning fluid to the letter. each camera has a specific procedure for sensor cleaning; if you precisely adhere to the instructions in your camera manual, you should have a successful sensor cleaning result. if there are still spots on your sensor after cleaning, you can re-clean the sensor provided your camera manual does not advise against doing so (i once ended up with an eyelash on my sensor that required two cleanings to remove; the first try simply moved it closer to the center of the sensor; this happens sometimes). if you follow the directions in your camera manual and in your swab and cleaning fluid to the letter, you should have no problems cleaning your sensor at home (or at your local museum or library, if need be). disclaimer 1: the above description of sensor cleaning is simply a description of how i clean my sensor; it is not intended as training or professional advice in sensor cleaning. 2: always follow the directions in your camera manual and in your sensor cleaning materials to the letter. when in doubt, contact your camera manufacturer for advice on sensor cleaning, or return your camera to the manufacturer's repair department for sensor cleaning. 3: the author accepts no responsibility for damage of any kind resulting from do it yourself sensor cleaning. when in doubt, contact your camera manufacturer to return your camera to the manufacturer's repair department for professional sensor cleaning. edited april 11, 2019 by herr barnack", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 19792, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 358616, "autor": "marchyman", "date": 1558720440000, "content": "So far all I've had to do to get rid of similar dust spots is to blow them out using a rocket blower.

To put things in context.... I used the Eyelead (the one recommended for Leica and Sony) first with this cleaning episode because I saw some prominent, easy to reach spots. However, I also saw some streaks while checking. After trying the Eyelead on the spots, there were marks on the surface that were left behind, so I had to go right to wet cleaning (green swabs...going back and forth with \"Sensor Cleaner\" and \"VDust\" solutions).

Hello everybody This is my first post on this forum. This topic is of interest to me, because I have recently succumbed to temptation and have ordered an M246 (at the new, reduced price here in the UK). I hope it\u2019s okay to be posting this here, rather than starting a new thread. Specifically, I would be very interested to know of any experiences of using the relatively new CV 21/3.5 lens, that Mr Andersson asked about here a few month ago. I\u2019d like to buy a 21mm lens to use on the M246, when it arrives, and also on an MP which I have had for a little while (it was using the MP that convinced me that I should stop vacillating and get a monochrom). It will be used primarily for landscapes, mostly in Scotland, sometimes in low light, and, less often, for churches and cathedrals (inside and out). So, although a really fast lens is arguably less important for the M246, given its ISO performance, it\u2019s obviously a little more important for film. Although the CV 21/1.8 is tempting, I\u2019d also like something quite small, hence my interest in the CV 21/3.5. (I need to decide whether size or speed is more important.) I\u2019ve failed to find much about it on the internet (aside from one pretty positive review, here by Steve Huff). So if anybody has actually used it on either monochrom camera \u2014 or, for that matter, on any other camera \u2014 it would be great to hear what you think. The Zeiss 21/2.8 is also an option, of course. Thanks \u2026.

But not during the first years! Many of us paid nothing to have the sensors replaced and get a free CLA during the process. They even collected the camera from home for free! As Keith wrote, we all agree that communication was rubbish but the date of the end of the free replacement period was well known and talked about on the LUF well before it arrived. I agree with you though, there should not have been a time limit. The old sensor can develop the problem any any time. 5, 10, 15 years down the line, it's still a design fault that should be repaired for free. Like you and everyone I was annoyed and frustrated that it took so long for the work to be done. I was without mine for about 5 months and from what I've seen that could be considered a short wait. But I only have one.. having five, you could have sent them in one by one and not have to wait at all to have access to one. Did all 5 develop this issue? 20 minutes ago, paulmac said: As I said though, I just clone out the areas and to be fair I can't think of any digital image that doesn't need some work on it either clone/heal to get rid of dust or in this case blobs from the sensor corrosion and so not an issue other than the devaluing of the camera. The problem you might have though is that the corrosion spots get worse over time. Re cleaning... I have a few dust spots from time to time but I don't have any software to remove them.

I have been a Canon man for the past 20 years with 1D Mkiii and a 5Dmkii and a whole bunch of L glass. I've always been inquisitive about Leica so three months ago bought a M9P and three lenses. The Elmarit 28mm, Summarit 50mm and an older Elmarit 90mm. I realise that they are down the \"cheaper\" end of the scale (if there is such a thing) but I thought that it was a good starter setup. I'd like to offer my observations and would be interested in any advice or opinions. Positive Image quality. Fantastic. Depth of colours and contrast is amazing. I recently went to Silverstone for a Classic car event and used the Canon 5D Mkii on Saturday and the M9P on Sunday. Apart from the reach (for the race track) as a walk around camera I was much happier with the Leica than the Canon. Focusing. I was warned about the transition from automatic on the canon to manual on the Leica but it wasn't a huge issue. I don't miss. After an initial period of hunting and doubting my technique I found that I was hitting 99% of the time. I find myself taking more time over composition after setting initial focus. Delighted.

Battery life hasn't been a problem. Challenges (not negatives) Bokeh. I have been a little disappointed with the \"quality\" of the bokeh. Is this because the fastest lens I have is my 2.4. I seam to get a smoother bokeh at similar apertures on my canon. Metering. This has been my biggest disappointment. I know how it works but even scenes that are back lit by just a 1/4 of the image i.e. 3/4 subject and 1/4 sky are underexposed. I know the technique of pavement or \"shadow\" metering and half setting the shutter but this is a little long winded and irritating.

My experience is large format film, DSLR film and digital, Leica range finder both film and digital. The need for a built in light meter is a personal preference. I carry a hand held light meter. I use it in incident mode. Any built in light meter will be in reflective mode and require it to be viewing a correct gray scale reading, just like the DSLR. I suggest you look at how you will take light meter readings before you purchase. That said the MA is wonderful and the need to carry a meter is not a problem - for me.

Yes, the Lumix S 50/1.4 is sharper in the corners than the 50 Summilux-SL. This applies to every corner but I'll only post the lower right one here the way I like to compare them. But I'm not sure this is the right question to ask. The difference is not material IMO unless one crops a lot. But if one crops a lot, the difference in the way the two lenses render the OOF area becomes apparent and here the Summilux is smoother.

I printed iso 12500 images from my Monochrom several years ago at A2 and the difference on paper from base iso 200 was imperceptible.

Full screen on a 27\" iMac I can just spot 3200 at a normal viewing distance as being different to 1600 ..... and only 12800 looks in any way noisy.... and again only if you look for it.
