I would like to add one point if I may: even if the LCD's were in stock for the next decade: the current cost of having them replaced is almost nonviable. As a resident of the Oceania I feel our access to Leica service is less certain than in Europe and the USA, and that the cost of service including transportation can be very high. I would take this opportunity to note that I personally would feel more secure about future Leica purchases if I felt assured that the service I would get in the case of failure or damage would be Worlds Best. For me this definitely includes cost effectiveness of repair. Replacing a simple part like an LCD screen should not cost $800 Euro. If cameras are not repaired because the cost of repair is unjustifiable given the (low) market value of the camera: this situation itself puts further downward pressure on the product value. If lower service/repair charges require a new repair facility in the Asia region I would be very happy to hear that. Why not open one in Australia? --img--  For me the Leica advertising concerning reliability and long product life was an important factor in making my M9 purchases. Even with service support over the next decade- it seems that within a few years after release- the cost of repairing damage to these cameras at current pricing would outweigh the commercial viability of repairing them. I believe there may be many other Leica M digital owners like myself, for whom the camera purchase was a very significant financial decision. If repairs are unavailable or un-economical such Leica owners may be priced out of the brand. Such buyers may not have factored and may not be able to afford the ongoing running costs of owning Leica gear... I fear I may be one of them. here is a scenario: I am student I own an M8 which I saved hard for. I have had it 3 months... My first Leica! I am in love. My dog knocks it off a table! The 1965 Summicron is undamaged- just another nick on the chrome BUT the LCD is smashed. I only have 1000 dollars to spare currently: a) I contact Leica for a repair. It cannot be repaired. I am offered a new m9 for $3500. This is impossible for me. Rent must be paid after all.. I sell the broken m8 my Leica lens- and buy a Fuji . --img--  I contact Leica and they offer to repair the camera for $800 Euro (and my local authorised service agent adds another $300 AUD onto that amount). Faced with an 1100 + Euro repair quote I sadly but rationally decide to sell the camera and lens and Buy a Nikon. c) I contact Leica and they offer to repair the LCD for 300 USD (total cost) with a warranty on the LCD- or $550 with a full CLA and 12 month limited warranty for the camera. I am overjoyed and lock the dog outside from now on. Years later I buy an M12... and give the still working trusty, true 'enduring in value' Leica M8 to my daughter. Her first Leica! I know in this scenario replacement of the LCD is seemingly impossible... Call it a 2009 M9 in 2014 if needs be... In scenarios a, and b, my experience in owning Leica has been akin to that expensive and painful lesson of \"buying a Lemon\" car. Whatever the market demographic all Leica users will respond very warmly to enhanced service and affordable repairs. Nothing can buy goodwill like a good experience getting a broken product fixed- and this can be magnified tenfold if the price of the repair is actually lower than feared.... People generally have amazing goodwill dealing with product failures if they are sorted out efficiently and as painlessly as possible... Conversely even a one really bad service experiences can ruin a lifetime of support for a brand. In the case of Leica I think I could go as far as saying that their are people who would almost die for the company- that is how strong their attachment is. They would defend Solms with pitchforks if necessary: such is the love of the historical Brand and all its wonderful history. It would be a shame if the legend of 'Leica Service' were to become just that: a legend... My local camera repairman trained and worked at Leica in the microscope department. Years before that and as a child he vividly remembers visiting Solms in the late 1950's with his father. They were treated to a tour of the factory and his fathers M3 was serviced on the spot: for free of course. Some 50 years later he relates the story to me: almost with a tear in his eye, as he cleaned my M9 CMOS sensor- and vintage 50 summilux with the inestimable aid of his Leitz Stereo-Microscope...

--img--  for me the leica advertising concerning reliability and long product life was an important factor in making my m9 purchases. even with service support over the next decade- it seems that within a few years after release- the cost of repairing damage to these cameras at current pricing would outweigh the commercial viability of repairing them. i believe there may be many other leica m digital owners like myself, for whom the camera purchase was a very significant financial decision. if repairs are unavailable or un-economical such leica owners may be priced out of the brand. such buyers may not have factored and may not be able to afford the ongoing running costs of owning leica gear... i fear i may be one of them. here is a scenario: i am student i own an m8 which i saved hard for. i have had it 3 months... my first leica! i am in love. my dog knocks it off a table! the 1965 summicron is undamaged- just another nick on the chrome but the lcd is smashed. i only have 1000 dollars to spare currently: a) i contact leica for a repair. it cannot be repaired. i am offered a new m9 for $3500. this is impossible for me. rent must be paid after all.. i sell the broken m8 my leica lens- and buy a fuji . --img--  i contact leica and they offer to repair the camera for $800 euro (and my local authorised service agent adds another $300 aud onto that amount). faced with an 1100 + euro repair quote i sadly but rationally decide to sell the camera and lens and buy a nikon. c) i contact leica and they offer to repair the lcd for 300 usd (total cost) with a warranty on the lcd- or $550 with a full cla and 12 month limited warranty for the camera. i am overjoyed and lock the dog outside from now on. years later i buy an m12... and give the still working trusty, true 'enduring in value' leica m8 to my daughter. her first leica! i know in this scenario replacement of the lcd is seemingly impossible... call it a 2009 m9 in 2014 if needs be... in scenarios a, and b, my experience in owning leica has been akin to that expensive and painful lesson of \"buying a lemon\" car. whatever the market demographic all leica users will respond very warmly to enhanced service and affordable repairs. nothing can buy goodwill like a good experience getting a broken product fixed- and this can be magnified tenfold if the price of the repair is actually lower than feared.... people generally have amazing goodwill dealing with product failures if they are sorted out efficiently and as painlessly as possible... conversely even a one really bad service experiences can ruin a lifetime of support for a brand. in the case of leica i think i could go as far as saying that their are people who would almost die for the company- that is how strong their attachment is. they would defend solms with pitchforks if necessary: such is the love of the historical brand and all its wonderful history. it would be a shame if the legend of 'leica service' were to become just that: a legend... my local camera repairman trained and worked at leica in the microscope department. years before that and as a child he vividly remembers visiting solms in the late 1950's with his father. they were treated to a tour of the factory and his fathers m3 was serviced on the -----> spot !!! : for free of course. some 50 years later he relates the story to me: almost with a tear in his eye, as he cleaned my m9 cmos sensor- and vintage 50 summilux with the inestimable aid of his leitz stereo-microscope... the 'leica' magic has not worn off yet... thankyou for you time- edited august 29, 2012 by jaques", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 46484, "year": "2012"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 385179, "autor": "marknorton", "date": 1346567400000, "content": "To be clear, if you have the sapphire glass, it's the same old LCD, they are separate components.
