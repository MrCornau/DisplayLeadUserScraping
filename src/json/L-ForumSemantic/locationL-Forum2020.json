In theory, that spring itself can fail - but gummed-up lubricants in the mechanism are far, far more likely to cause a jam or sticking than a broken spring. ****Uh-oh!**** In examining my own M10 to confirm exactly how the lever works - I just noticed that the tip of the RF arm is catching or rubbing intermittently on the lens mount ring as the spring forces it forward.

It's a bitter taste and I totally understand your feelings. As I was told by Kanto Camera in Kawasaki, this matte finish is rather \"rough\" in it's structure and a soft eraser with tiny polishing particles, as most erasers have, is enough to polish down the finish.

I should consider myself a breaking even- the cost to have the car serviced was about the same as sending the camera to have the bad line remapped. And- servicing the car only took a few hours, sending the Camera away would be weeks. I modified my program to read the bad column(s) in from a file, and made adding the Gamma curve optional. I also found images where the bad column had \"hot\" pixels, good pixels, and \"Cold\" pixels. Which just meant taking \"Absolute values\" for the threshold test when deciding to correct a pixel or not. ANYWAY: when looking at the \"bad\" column on my camera, the structure is retained- just the level is above or below the neighbors. Rather than just average over the column all the time, my code computes a local offset and applies it when the levels of the bad column is too far above or below the two neighbors. A running average of 5 pixels is used to compute the local offset. The code at present generates a new file, leaves the original intact. It works with DNG files from the M Monochrom, and will not work with those emitted by Photoshop. Turns out that saved DNG files are different from what the camera generates. The same code will optionally add a Gamma curve, it asks for \"curve\" when starting up. a \"0\"- Gamma is skipped and a new file is generated starting with a \"C\" (Corrected). Give a curve from 1-8, get a file starting with \"G\" (Gamma). The program either works on one file at a time, or processes all the files in a directory. Runs on XP through to WIN10. Also runs on PharLap extended DOS, but different compiler options for that. This is a Windows console program. I did try an algorithm to identify the bad columns automatically. One of the test images: Fabric in a Hat lines up perfectly with the Columns of the image. Broke the algorithm. SO- back to determining bad columns using Photoshop to get the number, and just have the list read in at runtime. If anyone has a M Monochrom with a similar problem, I could look at a DNG file and see if this code corrects the problem. I can make up the file with the bad locations (trivial) and send the code to try out.

Dear all, My M9 experiences sensor corrosion now (announced to me by Leica today as I sent it for cleaning; I had the camera checked by Leica several times even during the free replacement period, and despite hard spots on the sensor it was several times confirmed by Leica that no corrosion existed, and I hoped it would be like this forever...).

For larger focus distances I see no issue. Two questions: 1. What could be done to also ensure focus accuracy for super wide angle: glass change to 0.8 instead of 0.6? (I need no IR capability.) 2.

They are not cheap, but cheaper than profoto for example. Still hardly anybody buys them. I have tried it and they work perfectly (robust and easy to setup). (But I use flash rarely, so I did not buy any flash system. This is probably typical for many Leica users). Rather people keep on complaining and asking for the impossible (a change in strategy). Even if all this happens, a solution along that road will come earliest in a few years. So I simply think people have no real problem. The solution is there, but hardly anybody uses it. Just this endless list of complaints. Ridiculous. If you have a real problem, open a self-help group and together buy one priolite set and test it in depth. Then you will know in a few days if it offers what you need or if you have to wait another year or two for something else. If you can afford one of the new noctiluxes, then the priolite set is just a fraction of this. (The priolite system actually works with almost any camera brand, so even if you go away from Leica, there is no danger to be stranded with unusabe stuff. Unlike the Leica flashes, that nobody but Leica can use). I was surprised when they announced that they will offer a Leica transmitter (about 2 years ago), because it was only for a small potential user group. And now I have the impression, it was maybe a bad decision (I wonder how many (or probably few) transmitters for Leica they sold in the last two years). When I tried to order Priolite some time ago, the battery strobe I tried to order was out of stock. May have been a coincidence but it made me change my mind. Furthermore, buying strobes is not necessarily a one-off decision - you are more likely buying into a system, depending on your needs and use. Priolite use the Bowens bayonet which is of course quite wide-spread, despite Bowens going bankrupt a year or two ago. But if you look at the Profoto system, you get a lot of interesting strobes and modifiers for all sorts of uses, both new, second hand or in rental shops. Work in a studio, with assistants? Rent or buy a power pack (D4 Air can be bought very reasonably second hand on eBay). Or get a couple of D2 monoblocks with great power and speed. Have a location shoot planned, without assistants, or your shoot is of the \"run and gun\" variety? Pack a couple of B10s (or A1s) with some umbrellas and lightweight OCF modifiers (the B10s are smaller than many lenses, still providing 250ws of power). Want to use a big pro ring flash? No problem (got mine from eBay for approx. 400 Eur). So, in the end, while the Priolite is a nice system that can work with a lot of Bowens-type modifiers, it is the big brands (Profoto, Elinchrom, Broncolor) that provide much wider system options for the avid strobe user. Meanwhile, Godox provide the cheaper solutions with the fastest developing feature sets and innovations (the AD200 mini strobes for example are rightly very popular). Markus Klinko has been a big advocate of Godox; I find his occasional write-ups on various blog sites quite useful. I have talked to Leica, Profoto and Elinchrom regarding support - everybody just says \"we are constantly improving our products but we cannot say if and when, blah, blah, blah\". I have suggested here and to Leica several times to adopt the Nikon protocol (like Hasselblad has done) given that their hotshoe is physically the same. I have given up hope. It is almost like some sort of subversion at Leica: we don't care that there is a Profoto and Elinchrom system trigger for every other camera system out there (even Pentax nowadays...). Buy a Leica S with a bunch of CS lenses if you want to sync your strobes at fast shutters speeds. And one more thing to set the record straight here: Some users have mentioned in this thread that trigger X or Y works fine with their Leica. In each case, these are the \"dumb\" radio triggers that will work with nearly every camera out there. There is no reason to advertise that \"my Elinchrom Skyport Plus / Profoto Air Sync or Connect works fine with my Leica SL and I don't complain\". Of course it works - at any speed up to the camera's max sync speed (more or less). So no problem if you shoot in a darkened studio or anywhere with relatively low ambient light level. These \"dumb\" triggers work like that with every camera ever produced that has a standard hotshoe. Even with cameras that have no hotshoe at all, just an X sync contact, if you connect the short cable provided with the trigger. What we are talking about is being able to sync at shorter sync speeds, beyond the camera's max sync speed, i.e. HS or HSS mode, depending on the strobe manufacturer. The purpose is to manage ambient exposure on location, outside of a darkened studio, without having to stop the lens down a lot or without using ND filters. Leica S users with CS lenses, or Leica Q users, can of course sync at much faster speeds (1/1000s and 1/2000s, respectively) with even with the \"dumb\" triggers - this is a feature of the leaf shutters used in their lenses. But with cameras with focal plane shutters (like the SL) this is possible only with dedicated, \"intelligent\" air triggers, that communicate with the camera body and switch into the HS/HSS mode automatically, whenever the shutter speed set exceeds the camera's max sync speed. In the ideal world, we would also be able to use TTL - which may be useful to some and not so useful to others. In the Profoto system, these are called Air-TTL triggers, in the Elinchrom world, they are the Transmitter Pro triggers, and for Broncolor, they are the RFS 2.2 triggers. This is what we are asking Leica and the strobe guys to offer us.

pack a couple of b10s (or a1s) with some umbrellas and lightweight ocf modifiers (the b10s are smaller than many lenses, still providing 250ws of power). want to use a big pro ring flash? no problem (got mine from ebay for approx. 400 eur). so, in the end, while the priolite is a nice system that can work with a lot of bowens-type modifiers, it is the big brands (profoto, elinchrom, broncolor) that provide much wider system options for the avid strobe user. meanwhile, godox provide the cheaper solutions with the fastest developing feature sets and innovations (the ad200 mini strobes for example are rightly very popular). markus klinko has been a big advocate of godox; i find his occasional write-ups on various blog sites quite useful. i have talked to leica, profoto and elinchrom regarding support - everybody just says \"we are constantly improving our products but we cannot say if and when, blah, blah, blah\". i have suggested here and to leica several times to adopt the nikon protocol (like hasselblad has done) given that their hotshoe is physically the same. i have given up hope. it is almost like some sort of subversion at leica: we don't care that there is a profoto and elinchrom system trigger for every other camera system out there (even pentax nowadays...). buy a leica s with a bunch of cs lenses if you want to sync your strobes at fast shutters speeds. and one more thing to set the record straight here: some users have mentioned in this thread that trigger x or y works fine with their leica. in each case, these are the \"dumb\" radio triggers that will work with nearly every camera out there. there is no reason to advertise that \"my elinchrom skyport plus / profoto air sync or connect works fine with my leica sl and i don't complain\". of course it works - at any speed up to the camera's max sync speed (more or less). so no problem if you shoot in a darkened studio or anywhere with relatively low ambient light level. these \"dumb\" triggers work like that with every camera ever produced that has a standard hotshoe. even with cameras that have no hotshoe at all, just an x sync contact, if you connect the short cable provided with the trigger. what we are talking about is being able to sync at shorter sync speeds, beyond the camera's max sync speed, i.e. hs or hss mode, depending on the strobe manufacturer. the purpose is to manage ambient exposure on location, outside of a darkened studio, without having to stop the lens down a lot or without using nd filters. leica s users with cs lenses, or leica q users, can of course sync at much faster speeds (1/1000s and 1/2000s, respectively) with even with the \"dumb\" triggers - this is a feature of the leaf shutters used in their lenses. but with cameras with focal plane shutters (like the sl) this is possible only with dedicated, \"intelligent\" air triggers, that communicate with the camera body and switch into the hs/hss mode automatically, whenever the shutter speed set exceeds the camera's max sync speed. in the ideal world, we would also be able to use ttl - which may be useful to some and not so useful to others. in the profoto system, these are called air-ttl triggers, in the elinchrom world, they are the transmitter pro triggers, and for broncolor, they are the rfs 2.2 triggers. this is what we are asking leica and the strobe guys to offer us. edited january 20, 2020 by albireo_double", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 29025, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 416085, "autor": "fotonutzz", "date": 1580379660000, "content": "On 12/9/2019 at 9:58 AM, nryn said: I just finished a 4-day shoot for a book with an SL2, SF C1 and 3 flashes: an SF 60 and two MG-10s. I have wanted for some time to get away from bringing my huge strobes everywhere. A few notes: The MG-10s are excellent flashes and work well with the SF C1 and SL2. As reported in this thread and elsewhere, the SL2 has some hiccups when using with a flash: I couldn't get the flashes to fire consistently in A or S modes, nor could I figure out the conditions under which they either would or would not fire. It wasn't sync speed, TTL vs. M, or anything like that. It just seemed random, both in my testing before the shoot and whenever I tried to use A or S during the shoot. It wasn't a big deal--I usually expose manually when using flash anyway. But it's strange and I suspect it's a bug. HSS only works in TTL. I don't find TTL on the SL2 very good. Shooting from the same location, same exposure, same ambient light--I got exposures all over the place. Like with exposure mode on the camera, I went to manual on the flashes as well. The SF C1 is a nice piece of kit. I've used a number of remote triggers such as this, which allow you to control individual flash output independently, and I found this controller intuitive and slick. I like that it is low-profile and well-made. The SF 60 is OK; I ended up using it occasionally as a bounce flash to remove shadows and relied on the MG-10s for primary flash (to counter some strong sunlight from windows). Pretty happy with the results and extremely happy with the portability of this lighting kit. I don't think the Einsteins will come out of the drawer very often anymore.

Now, I think it's time we all come together and maybe figure a way to establish some sort of test so the Q2M users can figure their sensors. Is there a specific setting - in the shots, that helped reveal the dead pixel? @anuncastshadow what about in your case? would you mind to share too? Thanks @nwphil I am not an expert with technical experiments, but I can mention that my first experience with the camera was taking miscellaneous photos around the apartment, familiarizing myself with macro mode, autofocus behaviors, et cetera. Upon zooming in to 100-200% levels in Lightroom to observe the resolution (pixel peeping I suppose) I noticed that some images exhibited the white dots, and others did not. Upon further review, I noticed that they occurred regardless of aperture or shutter speed, and that they definitely occurred in any exposure using ISO 800 and above. After noticing the issue, and in an attempt to most clearly illustrate the issue with Leica, I took two images with the camera in Manual mode, Macro mode disabled, and the lens cap attached and manual focus set to nearest distance. One exposure was 1/60 @ f/1.7 ISO 800, and another 1/250 @ f/8 ISO 250,000. Both images, when viewed in Lightroom, appeared identical in terms of the intensity of the white dots, and their location. To me, this meant that aperture and shutter speed was not important in producing these artifacts, but confirmed that the ISO does. Subsequent exposures, regardless of aperture, shutter speed, or focusing distance produces these dots. Once the ISO is adjusted to 400 or lower, they are absolutely invisible. I am still waiting to hear back from Leica, and with COVID forcing most of their employees to work in a limited capacity, I am unsure when I may receive a response. However, I am inclined to return the unit, despite the shop that sold me the unit seeming to have a preference to wait for Leica to produce a mapping of my sensor to resolve the issue. He (the shop owner) clarified that his statement earlier about the issue being observed on M cameras was mistaken, as this does not appear to be the \"hot pixel line\" problem he has seen on digital M cameras in the past. I am a bit skeptical about the pixel mapping process (though I am familiar with it, and have heard of it being performed for other digital camera manufacturers in the past) only because it's usually used to resolve or map maybe a handful of pixels, not the 21 I can count on my sensor. I should also clarify that using the term \"hot pixel\" to describe my issue may be inaccurate, as hot pixels usually occur when the sensor is quite literally \"hot\", for instance during extremely long exposures. The shop owner also indicated he did not believe them to be \"dead pixels\" but I suppose I am not sure what else they would be. Anyway, I hope this information is helpful, and again, I will provide the update I hear from Leica when it arrives, but I most likely will pursue a replacement rather than proceed with a pixel mapping attempt if it is indeed offered.
