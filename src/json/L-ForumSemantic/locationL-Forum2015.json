This says: set TheApp to \"/Applications/m8raw2dng\" This tells the droplet that the m8raw2dng executable is in /Applications We put in the current user's directory so we change the line to: set TheApp to \"~/m8raw2dng/m8raw2dng\" (keep the tab in front of the line) (on unix systems the ~ is the path to the current user's home directory) 3. Save the file Next we must set the parameters. The most important being the output location (where to put the newly created DNG files). 1. Go to your Pictures folder 2. Create a folder called: m8raw (A different name is possible, if so change the following to reflect your folder's name) 3. Open the main.scpt in the droplet as before 4. Go to line 11.
