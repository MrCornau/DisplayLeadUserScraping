Your figure of 2,000 lenses with TTH matches the number used by Dumur when speaking to Weaver and, so, perhaps he was talking about TTH examples only? That is numbers/numbering more or less accounted for. As for copyright, whether breaches actually occurred 90 to 100 years ago may just be a moot point now as no cases testing that hypothesis actually occurred at that time and many lenses with similar features were being constructed and/or manufactured during that period. Lens design by that time in many ways represented a \u2018language\u2019 rather pure \u2018invention\u2019 and, so, while patents were awarded for different designs, actually arguing successfully that breaches in respect of specific \u2018intellectual property\u2019 had occurred might have been difficult.

That is why I used the word \u2018assigned\u2019. Your figure of 6300 manufactured is not too far away from the 6190 shown as being manufactured in the Blue Book. Then there are the Xenon lenses which seem to have been made by Schneider, as mentioned by Lex ( Sandro). Your figure of 2,000 lenses with TTH matches the number used by Dumur when speaking to Weaver and, so, perhaps he was talking about TTH examples only? That is numbers/numbering more or less accounted for. As for copyright, whether breaches actually occurred 90 to 100 years ago may just be a moot point now as no cases testing that hypothesis actually occurred at that time and many lenses with similar features were being constructed and/or manufactured during that period. Lens design by that time in many ways represented a \u2018language\u2019 rather pure \u2018invention\u2019 and, so, while patents were awarded for different designs, actually arguing successfully that breaches in respect of specific \u2018intellectual property\u2019 had occurred might have been difficult. Leitz definitely erred on the side of caution in respect of Schneider and , where applicable, TTH. What we don\u2019t seem to know is whether any commercial consideration existed alongside this caution. Or do you know something about this as well?
