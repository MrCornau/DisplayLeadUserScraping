DSLR cameras to date have been the equivalent of a hypothetical personal computer having an operating system with embedded apps. I have no use for tax calculation software, for Adobe Illustrator, Angry Birds or other game software; I'd rather use Photoshop than the Silkypix or Photo Deluxe embedded in the hypothetical operating system; I'd also rather use Open Office than the MS Office hard-wired into the computer. In varying degrees, personal computers used to be made like this. DSLR cameras still are. I'd rather have more buffer space than AF or AE or movie apps. I'd rather the people who want those apps pay for their development. I'd rather these apps not get triggered when my fingers accidentally strike the wrong key. (OTOH those who know their computer keyboards intimately would never do this... or perhaps they should try pulling a DLSR with 560mm lens attached out of a cramped kayak cockpit while the otter is playing next to the kayak without bumping any switch or button before telling me to learn how to use my camera.) There's no reason this flexible configuration model used by personal computers can't be adopted by camera makers. Sell the basic box cheap, the money is in the apps. Firmware updates would be history, replaced by operating system updates and updated individual apps. I'd get just the apps I wanted, other can load their camera with as many features as they want. No waiting for the camera maker to update the firmware, buy an app from an independant software developer. I think this button bumping thing is overblown, first off, you have to press a button and also turn a dial to make a change. You can spin the dials all you want while the camera is asleep and you won't change a thing (I wouldn't recommend the same with the M240 or any fully manual camera). To actually get to the weird features you have to hold the camera like a point and shoot (with both hands), depress a recessed button on the left side (bump all you like) aaand spin the dial with your right thumb, then press set on the center of the dial. You literally have to use both hands... I've never ever accidentally activated a feature, and I'd pay good money to see somebody get to multiple exposure mode by bumping their camera to their butt (one handed would be extremely difficult). As for the buttons on the right side, as I said before, if you press the ISO button or something (or any button on the left side).. just tap the shutter and you're back in business.. It even has a \"My Menu\" where you can put your most used features (mirror lockup?, format card?, etc, etc). It's customisable! And operating system updates are firmware updates.. Once you update the firmware and if you break compatibility with an app you'd need an app update. If you had multiple apps you'd have to wait for multiple developers.. There would be a lot more waiting.. We really can't compare cameras with iOS devices or PC's that number in the billions of units, supply and demand. I just don't want people thinking that DSLRs are intractable computers. What's funny to me is that every single poster on this thread is knowledgable enough that they could pick up any DSLR and learn to use it really really well in less amount of time that it would take to read half of these posts. If you don't like them it's fine, if you don't want to learn to use them it's fine as well. It just seems like people have this idea that the way they operated is inherently wrong and that's what I don't agree with.

I think this button bumping thing is overblown, first off, you have to press a button and also turn a dial to make a change. You can spin the dials all you want while the camera is asleep and you won't change a thing (I wouldn't recommend the same with the M240 or any fully manual camera). To actually get to the weird features you have to hold the camera like a point and shoot (with both hands), depress a recessed button on the left side (bump all you like) aaand spin the dial with your right thumb, then press set on the center of the dial. You literally have to use both hands... I've never ever accidentally activated a feature, and I'd pay good money to see somebody get to multiple exposure mode by bumping their camera to their butt (one handed would be extremely difficult). As for the buttons on the right side, as I said before, if you press the ISO button or something (or any button on the left side).. just tap the shutter and you're back in business.. It even has a \"My Menu\" where you can put your most used features (mirror lockup?, format card?, etc, etc). It's customisable! And operating system updates are firmware updates.. Once you update the firmware and if you break compatibility with an app you'd need an app update. If you had multiple apps you'd have to wait for multiple developers.. There would be a lot more waiting.. We really can't compare cameras with iOS devices or PC's that number in the billions of units, supply and demand. I just don't want people thinking that DSLRs are intractable computers. What's funny to me is that every single poster on this thread is knowledgable enough that they could pick up any DSLR and learn to use it really really well in less amount of time that it would take to read half of these posts. If you don't like them it's fine, if you don't want to learn to use them it's fine as well. It just seems like people have this idea that the way they operated is inherently wrong and that's what I don't agree with.
