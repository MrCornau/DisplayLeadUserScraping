So it seems that they were introduced only during the war (or perhaps shortly before it), perhaps only in Germany, and probably not during the whole wartime. Bakelit was a rather expensive plastic and I doubt that it could be used for \"civilian\" purposes during wartime. Whilst the pricelist from march 1951 still has all of them, the next list from April 1952 only mentions the \"Bakelitdose\" BDOOZ for the 13.5cm Hektor, which also disappeared in the catalogue from 1954. For all shorter lenses the list from 1952 only mentions the new transparent \"Polystyrol-Objektivb\u00fcchsen\" (BOORW, BOOSK and BOOPV) . So the scarcity of the bakelit containers may be explained by the short time of approx. a dozen years when they were offered by Leitz, and even this short span may have had a large gap during wartime and perhaps the very first years after the war.

It is not the N version of the FOFER which was introduced for the Nagel Pupille to fit in a special foot (see photos below) on the camera. The FOFER N had close focus markings to match those on the extending mount of the Pupille lens which are marked as 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.35, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 2.4m and so on. I have not been able to check whether the N version has a greater length/base to give the precision needed for all of those close focus distance marks. The item shown above is a standard one for use on a Leica which has been cut up probably with the intention of making modifications which could, of course, have been done inside the Wetzlar Factory. Luigi's suggestion of the intention of making a longer base for greater precision is a strong possibility. It does not have a serial number and in my experience very few Leica/Leitz rangefinders have such numbers. I started a conversation with Jim Lager about the serial numbers on rangefinders issue, but we did not get that far. As you have no serial number to assist you, it might be worthwhile showing these pictures to Lars Netopil as regards whether it is a prototype. He will have seen and photographed other prototypes in the 'museum' in Wetzlar. One possibility is that this example might constitute work in progress for the FOFER N version, but, as I said, this has the standard Leica distance marks rather than the Nagel ones. Here is my Nagel Pupille with Leitz Elmar showing how the FOFER was attached via a little metal foot. That foot is rarely found.

It is not the N version of the FOFER which was introduced for the Nagel Pupille to fit in a special foot (see photos below) on the camera. The FOFER N had close focus markings to match those on the extending mount of the Pupille lens which are marked as 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.35, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 2.4m and so on. I have not been able to check whether the N version has a greater length/base to give the precision needed for all of those close focus distance marks. The item shown above is a standard one for use on a Leica which has been cut up probably with the intention of making modifications which could, of course, have been done inside the Wetzlar Factory. Luigi's suggestion of the intention of making a longer base for greater precision is a strong possibility. It does not have a serial number and in my experience very few Leica/Leitz rangefinders have such numbers. I started a conversation with Jim Lager about the serial numbers on rangefinders issue, but we did not get that far. As you have no serial number to assist you, it might be worthwhile showing these pictures to Lars Netopil as regards whether it is a prototype. He will have seen and photographed other prototypes in the 'museum' in Wetzlar. One possibility is that this example might constitute work in progress for the FOFER N version, but, as I said, this has the standard Leica distance marks rather than the Nagel ones. Here is my Nagel Pupille with Leitz Elmar showing how the FOFER was attached via a little metal foot. That foot is rarely found.

A change of pace from the usual fake Luftwaffen Eigentum with Reichsadlers, etc. Now the IIIcK pictured on the other hand looks legit. Bill, I can talk to some of the experts at PCCGB about doing something on the mystique of British military numbers for Viewfinder. The guys there are really enthusiastic. One of them put on his old military uniform to show off his camera which had been on an RAF bomber, if I remember correctly. We also have a member in the US who regularly contributes on some wonderful US military stuff. Not only Leicas and Leica copies, but also those big Kodaks in khaki paint have been shown.

Perhaps this was a change for all lens caps of other length lenses also. The original boxes are also rarely seen; in the photo is an early very dark red/brown tube and also one of the later red varieties. Late units have an infrared mark. These lenses were not especially successful and production (1932 to 1937) was low (3975), but obviously they are interesting to me and I enjoy them. All comments welcome.

The original boxes are also rarely seen; in the photo is an early very dark red/brown tube and also one of the later red varieties. Late units have an infrared mark. These lenses were not especially successful and production (1932 to 1937) was low (3975), but obviously they are interesting to me and I enjoy them. All comments welcome. Woosh...and I thought I had had a \"significant\" collection! My archive's listings give a modest eleven references for the \"berg\" Elmar 105 : serials 107922, 123405, 128320, 128926, 136949, 136993, 162611, 162938, 251381, 300095 and 300302. It seems that my first serial pertains to the earliest produced (the second limited batch quoted by Alan). The photos I choose are those of serials 123405 (sorry, I could not find an illustration of n\u00ba107922), 136949, 162611, 162938 and 300095. I also add a photo of the red (?) box I had, and of the Elmar 105 mountedd in Compur of another brand (not from my collection). Hope it will help historians. --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 38665, "searchterm": "prototype", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['alan', 'mcfall', 'img', 'img', 'elmar', 'known', 'detail', 'discuss', 'attach', 'photo', 'collection', 'range', 'early', 'late', 'production', 'factory', 'serial', 'number', 'list', 'collected', 'serial', 'number', 'author', 'believe', 'uncoupled', 'version', 'exist', 'believe', 'confirm', 'account', 'lens', 'available', 'early', 'note', 'mention', 'march', 'dealer', 'bulletin', 'couple', 'model', 'launch', 'february', 'plenty', 'model', 'camera', 'benefit', 'rangefinder', 'coupling', 'die', 'leica', 'note', 'couple', 'version', 'july', 'august', 'publication', 'couple', 'version', 'exist', 'collector', 'love', 'prototype', 'exist', 'leitz', 'museum', 'different', 'production', 'lense', 'records', 'early', 'allocate', 'unit', 'record', 'possible', 'batch', 'lot', 'note', 'early', 'photo', 'deliver', 'berlin', 'july', 'definitely', 'couple', 'batch', 'range', 'leitz', 'normally', 'use', 'lense', 'sell', 'use', 'manufacture', 'cameras', 'early', 'elmar', 'share', 'early', 'unit', 'black', 'nickel', 'black', 'chrome', 'distance', 'scale', 'foot', 'engrave', 'germany', 'evidently', 'export', 'engrave', 'meter', 'germany', 'engrave', 'early', 'lense', 'xxx', 'lens', 'cap', 'complete', 'internal', 'velvet', 'cover', 'covering', 'inside', 'rim', 'change', 'lens', 'cap', 'length', 'lense', 'original', 'box', 'rarely', 'photo', 'early', 'dark', 'red', 'brown', 'tube', 'later', 'red', 'variety', 'late', 'unit', 'infrared', 'mark', 'lense', 'especially', 'successful', 'production', 'low', 'obviously', 'interesting', 'enjoy', 'comment', 'welcome', 'woosh', 'think', 'significant', 'collection', 'archive', 'listing', 'modest', 'reference', 'berg', 'elmar', 'serial', 'serial', 'pertain', 'early', 'produce', 'second', 'limited', 'batch', 'quote', 'alan', 'photo', 'choose', 'serial', 'sorry', 'find', 'illustration', 'add', 'photo', 'red', 'box', 'elmar', 'mountedd', 'compur', 'brand', 'collection', 'hope', 'help', 'historian', 'img', 'img', 'img', 'img', 'img', 'img', 'img']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9805}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": null, "Emotion": null, "temp_list": null, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 133, "Relevance": 49.09, "content": " 9 hours ago, IkarusJohn said: How do you extract batch numbers from the serial numbers?

On my photo in #87 you may see two small patches between the Leitz serial number and \u201eElmarit\u201c and between \u201e90\u201c and \u201eLeitz\u201c. There are very small screws in recesses and it looks as if you could loosen the front ring by them and would find the Schneider serial number below. (I won\u2018t try as I am sure I would loose the tiny screws\u2026). Actually, there are not screws holding this ring. They are depressions or notches that take a spanner tool. I tried with my rubber ring lens tool and it wouldn\u2019t budge. I tried this tool on my chrome 90 Elmarit, and I was able to remove that ring.
