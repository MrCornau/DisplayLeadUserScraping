The shutter blade center weighted metering is pretty archaic and is too easily fooled with point light sources at night. - Figure out how to make the camera lighter. Personally, I'd prefer the M11 be Aluminium top and bottom covers, gorilla glass, and a red dot logo, and release the M11-P at the same time with Brass top and bottom plates, sapphire glass, and without the red dot (for the traditionalists). - Release an optional bottom plate that has a more traditional battery/card door. Of course this needs good weather sealing as well. - Focus the M's sensor on high performance in any light, not resolution. 24MP is good, I think. ISO 50 would be welcome. Also, banding free at all ISOs. - Return of the 1/8000 sec shutter - USB charging of battery within the camera. - Half stops for the ISO dial. - Figure out how to fit the BP-SCL2 (M240) battery inside the M with the M10's size. (Its physically possible, but the SD card location prevents this). - Possibly add a small, circular OLED or E-ink display (similar to M8), for battery remaining info, as well as info for the exposure compensation selected.

Of course this would have to be done with the minimal of size increases. - On Sensor Image Stabilization. The M is a handheld platform. - Hybrid viewfinder. At the very least, integrate a high contrast OLED panel instead of the frameline masks. That way the frameline pairs and shooting info could be fully customizable.

Fortunately the M240 is still around as well. For my daily use the M10 would be perfect, but I judge it as a travel camera. And there the 240 reigns. Better battery life, video, better hold with heavy/long lenses, those are things that count. Now I travel with a 2KG long lens combo included and 4 batteries which I really need. With the M10 it might be 6 to 8, depending on the power use by the new EVF. The better RFVF and EVF cannot compensate, and the results out of the camera will be mostly identical. It certainly does look that way with the new emphasis in my mind. Leica wants me to to use the SL - Not going to happen. I don't have an option but to try find a work around and try and push Leica to continue developing the M240 line or extend the M10-P with functionality that this world has evolved with. But a simple continuation of the M-240 won't do for me - it needs developing. Ideally, I need the M10 to have usb and I want to be shooting this in way into the future with sensor improvements as they happen, more resolution etc. Sometimes I am on location for 10 days at a time and there are times when we don't have the luxury of power to charge things. While I can make do with M9 battery life, I do have a silly amount of them and to regress in that department seems a disappointment to me also. I agree - this is a travel camera, it's one of the reasons I choose to use it, so again to take away core functionality is just wrong. Video has it's place moreso in this day and age than anything. I can't even begin to mention how much more useful it is to have in one body, at your finger tips to be ready at the decisive moment rather than a separate system you have to reach for etc. It seems crazy to me to pull this as well - this is 2017 and video is part of every day life and becoming even more so by the day.

Yes, that's true and certainly in more recent years some of the cameras can feel a bit rough and shoddy compared with others. I once had an M7 that I could squeeze vertically about a millimetre or so on one side. I was told it was \"normal\". --img--  My point was really that one camera feeling less \"tight\" shouldn't indicate that it requires a major service when it has probably only had a few dozen rolls of film through it.

I think it is new. I was told last year by the service guy at Leica UK that Wetzlar had introduced a policy where any repair or service request would involve a mandatory CLA at around \u00a3600 or so. There are a number of anecdotal stories in this forum that back that up \u2013 I seem to recall someone needing either the frame selector lever or rewind switch replacing and being quoted for a price around \u00a3700 including a full CLA.

I can tell others on the Forum use them, especially the WC store, from their descriptions. They are the closest stores to me (i.e., less than 1000 miles) with a large Leica selection. If for some reason they don't have it, and I gotta have it, I go to David Farkas' store in Miami. He's also very helpful.
