Altho it is customary for many cameras to come with centrally located tripod connections you may well find that the M3's offset location at times is advantageous. Please note: Certain heavier range/viewfinder lenses such as the 135mm, F2.8, Elmarit & the earlier 90mm, F2, Summicron come with their own centrally located 1/4 & 3/8 combined tripod connections. The connection is on the lens where it should be with a heavier lens. I have used a 135mm, F4, Tele-Elmar for years in both horizontal & vertical format held in place by a medium sized Leitz Large Ball Head with no problems in terms of camera or lens movement. None. This is combined with easy adjustability on the tripod. Most Leitz/Leica range/viewfinder lenses without their own tripod connections are smaller, lighter & more centrally balanced than the above mentioned Tele-Elmar which has most of its weight at the end opposite the camera end because of a reasonably long lens barrel.

It is another really nice lens, both build and image quality-wise. Interesting to me that you mention this lens. I feel like we are on the same page. But, the 35mm/3.5 Summaron is not even close to being as optically advanced as the 2.8/5.6 Summaron. The 3.5/3.5 Summaron is a moderate contrast lens that is only sharp on axis and drops off precipitously by 6mm. Even stopping it down to 5.6 only improve softness a little bit across the frame. I also own the 3.5/35mm Summaron LTM and really like the way it renders regardless of its optical limitations. But, it can not compare to modern lens designs the way the 2.8/5.6 Summaron can. I believe this is why Leica chose the 3.5/5.6 Summaron. The 3.5/5.6 Summaron is still optically relevant. Historically, the 3.5/5.6 Summaron gave way to the M mount Emarit 2.8. But, it really wasn't until the version IV of the Elmarit that the sharpness across the frame caught up to the 1950 designed Summaron 2.8/5.6. The little Summaron's double Gauss design although, optically not on the level of the latest Summicron, produces a classic look that is still optically relevant compared to modern lenses. Rick Thanks Rick. Yes the f3.5 35mm Summaron is not as good as the f5.6 2.8 cm Summaron but the lens is still much better than some might expect and is available at a reasonable price to enable users to experiment with digital plus 'vintage look'.
