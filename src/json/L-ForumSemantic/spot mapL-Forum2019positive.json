Wet cleaning can of course be used on it's own for loose dust, before products like the Eyelead it was all we had. Oily spots need their own wet cleaning fluid, but this can leave streaks, so finish off with an everyday fluid.

Dandruff, minuscule sweat drops, skin flakes, small broken pieces of eylash, hair, you name it. Any wet cleaning will remove all. Oil spots are shiny and colourful, rather pretty really However, if it is oil or grease you will need a product like SmearAway to remove it.
