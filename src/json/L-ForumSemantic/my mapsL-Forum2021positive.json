How do you store your final images digitally? I emphasized digitally for all those who'll say to print them out and don't care about the rest, which I do. I have over 200 prints, but I still have over 60,000 digital files that I have to deal with Similar workflow. I edit in Capture One and export the few (emphasise \u201cfew\u201d) of my better ones to Apple Photos in case I want to show people. I don\u2019t duplicate the library in its entirety. Depending on the photo, I might keep the edited DNG in my folder structure, or delete it and just save the edited TIFF. I delete heavily though so I only have about 2,000 files in my computer folder structure (several copies saved on external disks) and fewer than 200 in Apple Photos.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 108096, "searchterm": "my maps", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['hirohhhh', 'workflow', 'pretty', 'begining', 'edit', 'photo', 'lightroom', 'classic', 'export', 'jpeg', 'apple', 'photos', 'edit', 'dng', 'lrc', 'library', 'overall', 'happy', 'solution', 'decade', 'photo', 'place', 'duplicate', 'think', 'separate', 'iphone', 'photo', 'apple', 'photos', 'library', 'photo', 'lrc', 'library', 'problem', 'view', 'experience', 'mobile', 'important', 'year', 'quick', 'easy', 'entire', 'photos', 'library', 'lightroom', 'phone', 'search', 'face', 'tagging', 'etc', 'leica', 'photo', 'apple', 'photos', 'library', 'come', 'handy', 'time', 'want', 'photo', 'find', 'quickly', 'downside', 'having', 'duplicate', 'photo', 'old', 'photo', 'change', 'editing', 'reason', 'different', 'version', 'lrc', 'photos', 'store', 'final', 'image', 'digitally', 'emphasize', 'digitally', 'print', 'care', 'rest', 'print', 'digital', 'file', 'deal', 'similar', 'workflow', 'edit', 'capture', 'export', 'emphasise', 'apple', 'photos', 'case', 'want', 'people', 'don', 'duplicate', 'library', 'entirety', 'depend', 'photo', 'edited', 'dng', 'folder', 'structure', 'delete', 'save', 'edited', 'tiff', 'delete', 'heavily', 'file', 'computer', 'folder', 'structure', 'copy', 'save', 'external', 'disk', 'apple', 'photos']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9635}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": "Sentiment(polarity=0.17132352941176468, subjectivity=0.45490196078431366)", "Emotion": "positive", "temp_list": null, "year": "2021"}], "name": "my mapsL-Forum2021positive"}
