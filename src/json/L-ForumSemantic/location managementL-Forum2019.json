I believe that Adobe no longer support this application as it has been replaced by the Creative Cloud Desktop App. To check which of your applications is 64bit go to the Apple on the menu bar and select about this Mac. Then select System Report. in the resulting page select Software/applications and it will produce a list of all the apps on your mac, selecting the app will produce a dialogue which includes whether the app is 32 or 64 bit. I use LR 6.14 and it is also 64bit and occasionally I get the same message, haven't done anything about it yet but will probably have to use the CC Desktop App in the future.
