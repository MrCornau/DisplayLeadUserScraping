Enabling bluetooth is going increase battery drain, but the incremental power draw should be small (sort of like turning on the A/C in your car).

Here is how it works: 1) Make sure Bluetooth is enabled in your SL2 2) Turn on Fotos in your iPhone 3) Connect to your SL2 in Fotos 4) Press the \u201cRemote\u201d button in Fotos. The satellite icon should appear on your top plate and in your EVF. Pictures you take will now be tagged with GPS info, regardless of whether the picture is taken through Fotos or with the shutter release on the camera. Note that the connection between Fotos and the camera over WiFi must remain active for the geo tagging to work. The satellite data remains active for some seconds after you disconnect, but not minutes. Not the most elegant solution Inhave seen, but it does appear to work, and at least you can use the camera to release the shutter, not just Fotos. Wish it just required a low power Bluetooth connection and active Fotos connection. Thank you! I'm just trying geotagging with SL2 and iPhone Fotos app and couldn't figure out how to enable after some googling until I found your post. Very helpful.
