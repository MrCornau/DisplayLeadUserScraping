Hello Steve, It appears that we are looking at a significantly cheaper to build range/viewfinder system which would be coupled with letting Leica move away from the optical/mechanical range/viewfinder which has been both the Hero & the Achillies Heel of the various \"M\" cameras. Both film & digital. Hero because it has allowed Leitz/Leica to be in a somewhat unique position in terms of its market share of the high quality lens business. Achillies Heel because of the need for highly skilled workers who are involved with an expensive technology that is from the First Half of the 20th Century. A technology that is pretty much unrelated to their current direction of development.

I was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. I put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of positions by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so I bit. Shooting Leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and I have shot with every mainline production M I can think of, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M4-2, M4-P, M6, M6TTL, M7, MP, M-A, M8, M8.2, M9P, Monochrom, M-P240, M246, and M262. Still, the screen-less Leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. I have had the chance to shoot my M-D for one day at Universal Studios Hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in Orlando, Florida. During this time, I averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. I shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. I attached the new 35mm/2.0/ASPH/II lens and an E39 UVa and didn\u2019t look back. The camera shoots like an M7. It meters like an M7, focuses like an M7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that I developed with my M7. The big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable ISO dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an M7 without changing rolls of film. Having any speed film from 200-6400 ISO at the twist of a dial is very handy. The rest of the body works like an M7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. All in all, an excellent handling design. O.K., there is one tiny new item I need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. Luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. The shutter sound is discrete like an M should be, very much like the one in the M262, which has the current best M digital shutter. Several aspects of performance warrant discussion. First and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. The default compressed DNG files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. The second area worth note is the metering. The pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cClassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. Metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. The solution is what I term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. You simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. Using this approach, I achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. The slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. The continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. Battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. These numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. I did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and I would up with a dead battery one morning. I would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. The M-D comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. I would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. This is no MP black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the Kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. Other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. It wrote every single image I took to SD card without error, something no other M digital I have owned can claim. It really is that good. If I were to make two changes, I would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current Off/S/C/Timer. I did overachieve and put the camera into Continuous mode when I wanted Single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. Oh, and did I mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital Ms I\u2019ve purchased since 2006? Not a speck of dust! I did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named Kevin who has made a career out of photography. He loves his M\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of Canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. I explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. I caught him chimping the ISO dial a few times, and when I commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and I need to get me one of these (M-D).\u201d Kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and I would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. This, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. The M-D is up to the task. So, who should buy this camera? This is a little bit hard to define. The camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable. It should be durable enough to last for decades. I would expect the batteries and SD cards will be the lifespan-limiting commodities, not the M-D. If you want a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d Leica M digital for still images only, and have at least some skill with M cameras, this is an excellent selection, and could be your only M. If you need to work at the limits of M capabilities, lenses wider than 28 or longer than 90 (subjective), shoot macro, hold cameras overhead or away from your eye for perspective or safety,, shoot at f/0.95, or need to capture short video clips, then a \u2018240 may be a better tool, but don\u2019t forget the lessons the M-D and prior film M cameras teach us.

 by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so i bit. shooting leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and i have shot with every mainline production m i can think of, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m4-2, m4-p, m6, m6ttl, m7, mp, m-a, m8, m8.2, m9p, monochrom, m-p240, m246, and m262. still, the screen-less leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. i have had the chance to shoot my m-d for one day at universal studios hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in orlando, florida. during this time, i averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. i shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. i attached the new 35mm/2.0/asph/ii lens and an e39 uva and didn\u2019t look back. the camera shoots like an m7. it meters like an m7, focuses like an m7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that i developed with my m7. the big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable iso dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an m7 without changing rolls of film. having any speed film from 200-6400 iso at the twist of a dial is very handy. the rest of the body works like an m7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. all in all, an excellent handling design. o.k., there is one tiny new item i need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. the shutter sound is discrete like an m should be, very much like the one in the m262, which has the current best m digital shutter. several aspects of performance warrant discussion. first and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. the default compressed dng files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. the second area worth note is the metering. the pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cclassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. the solution is what i term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. you simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. using this approach, i achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. the slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. the continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. these numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. i did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and i would up with a dead battery one morning. i would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. the m-d comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. i would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. this is no mp black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. it wrote every single image i took to sd card without error, something no other m digital i have owned can claim. it really is that good. if i were to make two changes, i would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current off/s/c/timer. i did overachieve and put the camera into continuous mode when i wanted single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. oh, and did i mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital ms i\u2019ve purchased since 2006? not a speck of dust! i did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named kevin who has made a career out of photography. he loves his m\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. i explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. i caught him chimping the iso dial a few times, and when i commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and i need to get me one of these (m-d).\u201d kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and i would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. this, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. the m-d is up to the task. so, who should buy this camera? this is a little bit hard to define. the camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable. it should be durable enough to last for decades. i would expect the batteries and sd cards will be the lifespan-limiting commodities, not the m-d. if you want a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d leica m digital for still images only, and have at least some skill with m cameras, this is an excellent selection, and could be your only m. if you need to work at the limits of m capabilities, lenses wider than 28 or longer than 90 (subjective), shoot macro, hold cameras overhead or away from your eye for perspective or safety,, shoot at f/0.95, or need to capture short video clips, then a \u2018240 may be a better tool, but don\u2019t forget the lessons the m-d and prior film m cameras teach us. great overview, but an m1? you used the no-viewfinder m?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 19883, "year": "2017"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 359189, "autor": "IkarusJohn", "date": 1485249900000, "content": "Will you still say the same when the SL has 50MP? --img--  The 42MP A7r2 can be used easily handheld thanks to IBIS (in-camera image stabilization).

At that time, Leica had an unqualified commitment to replace affected sensors at no cost until 10 years after the CCD based cameras were discontinued. That means at least until 2025. Unless I have some of my dates wrong, I'm pretty sure there can be no argument about this. In 2017 (with 8 years left to run on their commitment), Leica changes the rules. This means that a buyer with a 2 year old M-E Monochrom or camera is under some uncertainty. Certainly, Leica will stand by its commitment given back in 2014 to replace the sensor at no cost, but will this endure for the entire 10 years those buyers will have relied upon when they purchased? Or will Leica change the rules again ... It seems to me that CCD based M camera owners have a number of choices (Jaap might like to share his consumer law expertise here - I wouldn't be so bold, but my understanding is that the consumer law in the place of purchase applies, and in any event Germany is quite good on consumer protection). For original M9, M9P and Monochrom purchasers, before the sensor fault was discovered, their rights would seem to lie in the original purchase - assurances of \"camera for life\" and defective goods etc. Most jurisdictions will have reasonably well developed laws on latent defect. In this respect, while Leica's commitment of 2014 is expressed to be a \"goodwill gesture\", it was clearly more than that. It was an offer of compensation to the world at large (owning CCD based M cameras) to settle any potential claims they might have. I have very little doubt that for anyone having the energy, the 2014 commitment by Leica is enforceable against them, despite their latest attempt to re-write the rules. For those who bought after the 2014 commitment, I think the position is stronger. The commitment would be easily identified as a representation which was relied upon by those buyers, and would be enforceable, I would think, against Leica. Then, for that small group (small?) who had their corroded sensors replaced with the same sensor (not the new sensor Leica assures us won't corrode), they are sitting on a time bomb, it seems to me. Theoretically, the replacement sensor is irrelevant, as Leica hasn't really rectified the inherent defect. Now, legal analysis will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, class actions will be available in the US and other jurisdictions will allow them and an energetic lawyer could easily go forum shopping to find the best place to sue. Leica would then be faced with settling those claims as they arose, much like a game of whackamole. But the point, as everyone here has made well, is the damage to the goodwill which has saved Leica in the past. The M9 was the camera which made Leica profitable again, and the cynical ease with which Leica seems to want to walk away from a commitment made to its loyal customers is breathtaking.

Now, I appreciate that such a recall may have brought the company to its knees financially, but at the very least I'd have expected them to honour their initial commitment to replace the faulty sensors as and when required. They have the numbers, and they can build inventory over time to mitigate the financial impact. Particularly so if only a relatively small portion of all sensors suffer from corrosion. If, in addition to sensor corrosion, other problems are identified upon inspection, then it is up to the customer to decide whether to proceed (and pay for the additional repairs) or not.

I think that the fundamental problem here is expectations. An 8 year old design which was discontinued 5 years ago is minimally halfway through its life and in some cases more than.

But at some point Leica will have to withdraw support entirely. Should they continue to offer replacement sensors up until the point at which support ceases? I think that whatever Leica did/does they are going to be criticised and the criticism is about a problem that they did not foresee, and about which they have now done something. I personally fully understand their position. Offering a replacement sensor, full service and full year's warranty is actually a great option, but there's a bottom line.

First, thank you for starting this thread and exercising such tenacity with everyone else in trying to resolve this issue that has occupied an inordinate number of hours. Are we in the thousands of hours, yet? When I finally took delivery of my black chrome Lux in December 2015, I was blindsided, like many, with the filter/hood issue and fired off an enquiry to Leica NJ. After six months of back and forth, in July 2016, I suggested that \u201cLeica might consider: produce an updated E43 UVa filter based on the mount of the E43 UV/IR #13417, only having 0.75mm pitch threads instead of the finer .5mm threads of the #13417. What\u2019s important in solving the lens hood problem is that the 3mm ridge of the #13417 fits perfectly between the prongs of the Summilux-M lens hood catches in shooting position as well as reversed for traveling. Also, this updated E43 UVa filter can be stacked on top of another filter (ND, color filter, etc.) and the lens hood can be attached for shooting or reversed for traveling. Two filters stacked using this updated #13417 as the outermost filter moves the hood forward about 9mm, but I don\u2019t see any vignetting from the hood. \"What I have done in the meantime is to modify a slimline UV filter, first removing the filter, then reducing the mount into a 45mm x 3mm spacer ring. This spacer ring allows me to easily change filters and attach the hood to the lens as it is designed. Now I can use ND filters with slower shutter speeds and wide open f-stops.\u201d The Leica rep in NJ thanked for me for the suggestions which he said were to be forwarded to Germany and that was the end of it.

I want to have my filter and use it, too, with my lens hood. In about fifteen minutes, I made an adapter ring that works. Cost: less than $20. Since the inside aperture diameter of a 43mm filter is 40.5mm, I used a Heliopan 40.5-43mm step-up ring (#270), which has an outside diameter of 45mm, and though it fits the inside dimension of the Leica hood, it is 1mm too thick to fit behind the lens hood catches. Lay it flat on a sheet of medium grit sand paper with the male threads facing up, and sand it down, reducing the 4mm thickness to 3mm. This way it will fit perfectly inside the lens hood catches. It isn\u2019t necessary to bother sanding the male threads of the step-up ring. You are now finished with the lens hood filter adapter ring. Now screw a 43mm filter into the step-up ring until it seats, then back it off about one-quarter turn to allow for the thickness of the lens hood catches when you position the filter + step-up ring into the front of the Leica hood. With the lens hood off of your lens now, position the filter + step-up ring into the front of the hood, depressing the lens hood catches. Release the lens hood catches and adjust the filter until it is secure. Finally, attach the lens hood with the filter + step-up ring to the lens, and make any final adjustments screwing the filter slightly if needed into the step-up ring so the fit is snug. Using this adapter step-up ring allows you to attach the lens hood as it was designed to the lens. This filter adapter ring is the same as mounting a super slim 3+mm filter, plus a 4mm filter to the Lux. The lens hood mounts in its customary groove. Since the 4mm filter is adjusted for a snug fit, it is perhaps more secure. You can use a polarizer with LV by easily rotating the hood, also. No vignetting that I can see, since the filter extends only 7+mm from the lens. The downside is that the filter adapter with the filter must be removed from the hood so that the hood can be mounted reversed for traveling. A hassle, so the hood stays mounted. Another thing, don\u2019t take the hood off with the lens pointed down, since the filter with the adapter ring may fall out. As a side note, for my first go-around, I modified an inexpensive aluminum 43mm filter, removing the filter glass, sanding the threads, and reducing the thickness to 3mm. It worked fine, but it looked too proto-type funky. Yes, the step-up ring was easier. Less sanding. Realize that not all 40.5-43mm step-up rings may fit, some being too wide.

Have a nice trip Bilbao was wet and brief and even good photography could not redeem it. We drove over the hills to the Rioja region and literally as you drive through a pass it goes from horrible to lovely, especially as first stop was Frank Gehry's hotel at Marques de Risqual. Then on to Salamanca, Caceres, Seville, Toledo and Madrid and a few points in-between. Long story short, I used the M10 and Q about 50/50, depending on time available and what we were doing. The Q remains a superb everyday camera. That said, I was in Berlin last weekend and just took the M10 and 35/f2 and a spare battery, which suits me fine. Having bought the M10, I've bought three lenses, a s/h APO 135 that gives stunning architectural detail shots hand-held at slow speeds, a Voightlander 15mm Mk 111 that is spectacularly sharp and free of aberration, and the 5.6 Summaron the other day, not been out with it properly yet. As the M10 is my first Leica with Live View, I got the digital viewfinder which makes the 15 and 135 lenses a joy to use. I also borrowed a 50 Lux having sold my 50 Cron and waiting for a black 50 Lux to come in. Thanks to the M10, have sold my MM9, a s/h a7r and a couple of lenses to pay for most of this changing. Even after all that, still keeping the Q.
