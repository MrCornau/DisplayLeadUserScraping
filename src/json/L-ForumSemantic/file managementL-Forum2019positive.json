If assigned an 8 bit depth (default) in the RAW processor, is that file, once \"transformed\" into a 16bit file in PS, truly a 16bit file, like the ProPhotoRGB that I get out of LR. The fact that the file size doubles suggests to me that the bit depth is doubled as well. But I have been led astray more times that I can fathom by common sense. Thanks for your continued interest.
