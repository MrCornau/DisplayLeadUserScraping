In the processing room and scanning room, it is best to have a HEPA filter that has been running for at least an hour or so near the scanner or processing room. When scanning, scan the film before it is put in plastic sheets, immediately after processing. The longer it has been sitting, the more it accumulates dust and grime, and the act of removing the film from the plastic causes static cling.

When you are placing the film in your hold or in your setup, use the a light table light and hold your film on an angle to it so that the bright light illuminates the dust spots. Use a blower to remove the dust as much as possible. If it does not work, use an anti-static brush and after doing so, do it again, as brushes usually deposit a few bits of dust as they work. But they do loosen it so it is easier to remove with air. Once you have finally done your scan, if all has gone well, there should be very little dust on the scan. If there is dust, I recommend using Photoshop over Lightroom. The content aware spot healing tool is much more sophisticated and performs better than the one in Lightroom.

All digital cameras with interchangable lenses have this problem, but an M camera is particularly prone, because there is no mirror as extra barrier and the lack of an AA filter makes the dirt more visible. One should prevent dust from entering the camera as much as possible. There are a number of strategies. 1. Avoid changing lenses more than necessary. 2.

(This may be a myth) Switch off the camera before changing lenses. But dust will come on the sensor anyway. Consult the manual to find the sensor cleaning item in the menu and use a FULLY charged battery. Before opening the shutter blow out the camera (using a bulb blower, not compressed air or your mouth!) to dislodge any loose dust. If the dust on the sensor is loose one can blow off the sensor using a good bulb blower, (Rocket Blower by Giotto for instance) with the camera mouth facing downwards. If that does not clear the problem there are sensor brushes like the Arctic Butterfly by Visible Dust that are quite effective or the little vacuum cleaner by Green Clean. At this stage the use of a Sensor Loupe can be very helpful. If spots on the sensor persist you are dealing with stuck dirt like pollen or oil spots and need to revert to wet cleaning. There are numerous threads on the subject. The Visible Dust products are highly recommended or the Green Clean wet-and-dry method. Use a proper solvent for grease if you think you are dealing with oil etc. (Visible Dust Smear Away or Dust-Aid Sensor Clean (my preference) Open the shutter for cleaning and blow it once again with a bulb blower or vacuum clean it, to remove any loose particles which might be dragged across the sensor and cause scratches. Although the M is full frame and there are size 1 sensor swabs on the market, I prefer using the swabs for 1.3 sensors (and APS-C swabs for the M8) Take a clean swab, put on three small drops of Sensor Cleaning Fluid and in two sweeps, top and bottom go to one side - do not over-press!!- and sweep back again, using the other side of the swab automatically. Or, using the wet-and-dry system, swab with the wet sponge and dry with a couple of sweeps with the dry swab. Don't let the fluid spill over the edge of the sensor too much - there are electronic connections there. That is all - close the shutter and test the camera by taking an unfocused image of an evenly lit surface at the smallest aperture. In the unlikely case it is needed, repeat. There are other cleaning systems, such as stamping tools. I find them quite effective, as long as there are no greasy spots on the sensor. Just stamp, don't rub. They are a bit scary as one pulls the cover glass. Leica Customer Service seem to be quite happy using them, so they should be safe. . There are also sensor cleaning services or Leica Customer Service, but those are expensive and will keep the camera for a while. They may also not be readily available if one is travelling. Sensor cleaning is something any owner should be able to do himself. If you are fairly certain your spots are oil or grease, it may be wise to omit the step with the Arctic Butterfly, as it may become contaminated by the grease. In case that happens it can be cleaned with the special fluid provided.", "autor": "jaapv", "date": 1617235200000, "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/270401-typ-240-sensor-cleaning/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4173986", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": false, "selectorShort": "None", "MarkedSent": "Curve of the sensor is baloney.

At this stage the use of a Sensor Loupe can be very helpful. If spots on the sensor persist you are dealing with stuck dirt like pollen or oil spots and need to revert to wet cleaning. There are numerous threads on the subject. The Visible Dust products are highly recommended or the Green Clean wet-and-dry method. Use a proper solvent for grease if you think you are dealing with oil etc. (Visible Dust Smear Away or Dust-Aid Sensor Clean (my preference) Open the shutter for cleaning and blow it once again with a bulb blower or vacuum clean it, to remove any loose particles which might be dragged across the sensor and cause scratches. Although the M is full frame and there are size 1 sensor swabs on the market, I prefer using the swabs for 1.3 sensors (and APS-C swabs for the M8) Take a clean swab, put on three small drops of Sensor Cleaning Fluid and in two sweeps, top and bottom go to one side - do not over-press!!- and sweep back again, using the other side of the swab automatically. Or, using the wet-and-dry system, swab with the wet sponge and dry with a couple of sweeps with the dry swab. Don't let the fluid spill over the edge of the sensor too much - there are electronic connections there. That is all - close the shutter and test the camera by taking an unfocused image of an evenly lit surface at the smallest aperture. In the unlikely case it is needed, repeat. There are other cleaning systems, such as stamping tools. I find them quite effective, as long as there are no greasy spots on the sensor. Just stamp, don't rub. They are a bit scary as one pulls the cover glass. Leica Customer Service seem to be quite happy using them, so they should be safe. . There are also sensor cleaning services or Leica Customer Service, but those are expensive and will keep the camera for a while. They may also not be readily available if one is travelling. Sensor cleaning is something any owner should be able to do himself. If you are fairly certain your spots are oil or grease, it may be wise to omit the step with the Arctic Butterfly, as it may become contaminated by the grease. In case that happens it can be cleaned with the special fluid provided.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 15417, "searchterm": "spot map", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['curve', 'sensor', 'baloney', 'start', 'use', 'swab', 'normally', 'need', 'extreme', 'case', 'dust', 'remove', 'invasive', 'mean', 'quote', 'question', 'spot', 'image', 'especially', 'small', 'aperture', 'sensor', 'dirt', 'digital', 'camera', 'interchangable', 'lense', 'problem', 'camera', 'particularly', 'prone', 'mirror', 'extra', 'barrier', 'lack', 'filter', 'dirt', 'visible', 'prevent', 'dust', 'enter', 'camera', 'possible', 'number', 'strategy', 'avoid', 'change', 'lense', 'necessary', 'change', 'lense', 'dust', 'free', 'environment', 'possible', 'rear', 'end', 'lens', 'clean', 'possible', 'change', 'lens', 'camera', 'mouth', 'face', 'downward', 'myth', 'switch', 'camera', 'change', 'lense', 'dust', 'come', 'sensor', 'consult', 'manual', 'find', 'sensor', 'clean', 'item', 'menu', 'use', 'fully', 'charge', 'battery', 'open', 'shutter', 'blow', 'camera', 'use', 'bulb', 'blower', 'compress', 'air', 'mouth', 'dislodge', 'loose', 'dust', 'dust', 'sensor', 'loose', 'blow', 'sensor', 'use', 'good', 'bulb', 'blower', 'rocket', 'blower', 'giotto', 'instance', 'camera', 'mouth', 'face', 'downward', 'clear', 'problem', 'sensor', 'brush', 'like', 'arctic', 'butterfly', 'visible', 'dust', 'effective', 'little', 'vacuum', 'clean', 'green', 'clean', 'stage', 'use', 'sensor', 'loupe', 'helpful', 'spot', 'sensor', 'persist', 'deal', 'stuck', 'dirt', 'like', 'pollen', 'oil', 'spot', 'need', 'revert', 'wet', 'cleaning', 'numerous', 'thread', 'subject', 'visible', 'dust', 'product', 'highly', 'recommend', 'green', 'clean', 'wet', 'dry', 'method', 'use', 'proper', 'solvent', 'grease', 'think', 'deal', 'oil', 'etc', 'visible', 'dust', 'smear', 'away', 'dust', 'aid', 'sensor', 'clean', 'preference', 'open', 'shutter', 'cleaning', 'blow', 'bulb', 'blower', 'vacuum', 'clean', 'remove', 'loose', 'particle', 'drag', 'sensor', 'cause', 'scratch', 'frame', 'size', 'sensor', 'swab', 'market', 'prefer', 'use', 'swab', 'sensors', 'aps', 'swab', 'clean', 'swab', 'small', 'drop', 'sensor', 'cleaning', 'fluid', 'sweep', 'press', 'sweep', 'use', 'swab', 'automatically', 'use', 'wet', 'dry', 'system', 'swab', 'wet', 'sponge', 'dry', 'couple', 'sweep', 'dry', 'swab', 'let', 'fluid', 'spill', 'edge', 'sensor', 'electronic', 'connection', 'close', 'shutter', 'test', 'camera', 'unfocused', 'image', 'evenly', 'light', 'surface', 'small', 'aperture', 'unlikely', 'case', 'need', 'repeat', 'cleaning', 'system', 'stamp', 'tool', 'find', 'effective', 'long', 'greasy', 'spot', 'sensor', 'stamp', 'rub', 'bit', 'scary', 'pull', 'cover', 'glass', 'leica', 'customer', 'service', 'happy', 'use', 'safe', 'sensor', 'cleaning', 'service', 'leica', 'customer', 'service', 'expensive', 'camera', 'readily', 'available', 'travel', 'sensor', 'cleaning', 'owner', 'able', 'fairly', 'certain', 'spot', 'oil', 'grease', 'wise', 'omit', 'step', 'arctic', 'butterfly', 'contaminate', 'grease', 'case', 'happen', 'clean', 'special', 'fluid', 'provide']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9821}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": "Sentiment(polarity=0.09322337384837387, subjectivity=0.5042760017760018)", "Emotion": "negative", "temp_list": null, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 188, "Relevance": 56.47, "content": "On 2/6/2021 at 12:08 PM, jpattison said: Well done, Could you give us more details, please?
