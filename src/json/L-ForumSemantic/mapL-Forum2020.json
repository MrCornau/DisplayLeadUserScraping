At least for me Lightroom and Mac Preview shows the Leica SL GPS locations at accuracy of 0.01 arc seconds, which is 1/360000 of a degree and corresponds to about 0.3 m on the equator. This, of course, does not directly tell anything about the accuracy of the GPS of the camera. I've tried two things so far. I looked at the test of the EXIF gps information in the DNG files and it seems to be degrees, minutes, according to the \"info\" page in Capture One, which reports the accuracy of the minutes to four decimal places. Fotos displays the locations in terms of degrees with a precision of one ten-thousandth of a degree. Adobe's DNG-Validate program reports out the locations in degrees, minutes and seconds, showing the last number to an accuracy of 0.01. I first thought those were minutes of arc.

Maybe it takes some time being active to get that kind of precision. I know surveyors' GPSes average over minutes to get better than a cm precision (which we don't need). A curious thing.

I do believe I have the option to return, but upon proof \u201cthe item is defective\u201d.

I have reached out to Leica with RAW images of the exposures made today with the lens cap attached (pure black) and am waiting to hear back. However, I am aware that my options moving forward may be limited based on the purchase information. The item was sealed, and sold through rangefinder.com.hk which I heard good things about, but I don\u2019t think they are an authorized Leica dealer, in which case that responsibility lies on me. But I do feel like I should be able to return the item within the 14 day return period to them (not Leica) regardless. Anyway, I digress, but I appreciate your input and will see what happens moving forward. For reference, the camera has Firmware ver. 1.0 installed, and I could not find any updated version on Leica\u2019s website. Will have to see if Leica can provide a custom firmware update to map the indicated areas.
