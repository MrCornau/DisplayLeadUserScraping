So many photos lack good composition, due to the situations people shoot in forcing them to the wrong camera position. Great job! Thanks for the overly kind words. My point in posting this particular grouping was in response to the notion earlier in the thread that the M10-R output was lifeless. The reality, AFAIC, is that with increased power comes increased responsibility. While working with the R has not been an unfamiliar experience, enough has changed in terms of WB, color tendencies, and yes, pixel count, to have required a bit of a learning curve. Much as it was when moving from CCD to CMOS, moving to the R, IMO, requires a certain level of mental recalibration before the results begin to meet or exceed one's expectations. The camera has only been in our hands for a couple of months. I have little doubt that there is more to learn. Funny thing that figure in #4. I did consider a heavy crop to actually make it the subject.

Image #8: N/A -Rationale: I had a slight preference to A due to the skin tones, but it\u2019s difficult for me to make an assessment here, as the focus is slightly different. -Additional Notes: note that the image on A is focused on the eye, whilst B is slightly off Image #9: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #10: B -Rationale: The tiles had more detail on B than A (Corners) Image #11: B -Rationale: I prefer the warmer look in (B) than the colder look in (A) Image #12: B -Rationale: Prefer how the tree looks (shadow) compared to A.

Anyway, I hope I didn't waste your time... Sorry guys I love gear but im not too techie... Steve, do not feel bad. When studying any subject you go through a sort of personal R&D (research and development process). There are mistakes along the way. But eventually you get to destination. Just keep studying. I once worked with an audio engineer on product designs over a multi year period as an after work part time project similar to how we all do camera study now. We actually worked on the design of two or three products, two of them were a stereo speaker and pre-Amplifier. His job was the technical side picking parts and circuits, my job was the user side deciding how it would sound and be operated. It was hard going at first, everything I learned was new to me, I felt about 1 mm tall as he and other associated engineers told me about things I did not know. But after a couple of years in which I also read a couple of books on the subject myself, I finally had as much Six Sense about the subject as the engineers did, and actually sent the design work in new directions they had never thought important, and I was right and it worked. So just keep studying, you obviously know a lot, and you will prevail. You and I are, in this industry, in the position of \"User Interface and User Outcomes\" (my terms) which is an important design position. When cameras and lenses were technically new and simpler, a single engineer could use-&-design it all. But nowadays with all the technical options a User Interface and Outcomes person(s) is/are needed to test and try to create outcomes with the product since the engineer is busy more with a thousand math and physics details necessary to make the product work. We have a design position as valid as the engineers. In this position we may start without or missing some knowledge, as do purchasing new users, thus we learn how to best design-&-use a product for even a new user. So even our mistakes are valid points that the design needs to consider. I think that sums up the enthusiastic user's position in any industry. Everyone on a forum is one of these \"user experience\" people subject to the same learning process. Trolls stop the learning process with static so I ground them in my reject list.

I would say, if you have never done a wet clean before then practice on an old camera first rather than \u00a35k worth of Leica because it could all end in tears I know, I know..... I'm not very smart about this. I bought all the tools and supplies ages ago, but never had the courage to practice on my good camera. Then I stupidly gave away some of my old DSLR cameras - I should have used one for learning how to clean sensors. My Leica M8.2 needs a cleaning, as does my M10. My Nikons tend to stay clean for a very long time, probably because the mirror is blocking the dust from getting onto the sensor.

I would be purchasing pre-owned and from some scouring I can see I can pick up a 240 for approximately $3000 USD at best (maybe $4000 CAD) and an M10 for about $6200 USD at best (approx $8000 CAD). Everything in me says for a first-time shooter twice the price for the body is just not worth it, and I should invest that $4000 in accessories and lenses. I must admit I am leaning toward using Voigtlander glass vs. Leica glass as I have seen incredible results from their 50 f/1.5 aspherical and their 35 f/1.2 which are the two focal lengths I use. Both can be had fairly cheap. If I'm honestly considering stretching my budget to $8000 CAD I could invest in something originally Leica as well. Just curious what everything thinks for a first-time shooter, if I should invest in the new model so I'm good for years, or should I stick to the 240 for now and figure things out later on? I have been progressively pairing down and simplifying my photography as the years have gone by. Went from Nikon with a crap ton of gear to realizing I only like 35 and 50 on full-frame and now I've sold my full-frame setup and switched to, believe it or not, a Fuji X100. My slow, deliberate style of shooting and mostly shooting in manual on the X100 has taught me that maybe Leica is the next foray. I lean toward the Typ 240 because: Cost Video capability (if I ever want it) Compatibility with the Olympus EVF; I find EVFs very helpful on occasion I lean toward the M10 because: Significantly thinner Better performance Future-proofing Wifi. I love being out and about and being able to transfer a photo to my phone and instantly edit and share. My X100 has this and I love it. Any thoughts?? This is my first time posting/replying in this forum so I apologize if this reply is too lengthy or goes against the rules (moderators - please correct me for future posts). However, I was just in a similar (but slightly different) situation as you Jinesh and felt I needed to weigh in... I began with Canon digital point and shoots in early 2000s, \u201cgraduated\u201c to a Canon 60D DSLR in 2011 as a college graduation present to myself, and then got my first Fujifilm camera (X100T) at the end of 2014. The X100T changed my whole love for and approach to photography, becoming more slow and deliberate like you mentioned It did for you. It remains one of the most important pieces of gear I ever purchased as it changed so much for me. Over the next few years, I sold off all of my Canon gear and fully switched over to Fujifilm, acquiring 5 more Fujifilm cameras (X-T20, X-T2, X-H1, X-Pro3, and X100V) from 2015-2020. I still use and love Fujifilm and the latest X100V is my favorite digital camera I\u2019ve ever owned. I also began shooting film a few years back and always held the Leica M3 as my DREAM camera that I would love to some day own. As luck would have it, around my 30th birthday, I was able to acquire a mint-condition SS 1959 M3 from the original owner (an older gentleman who owned a local camera shop near me) for an incredible price ($800). My love for Leica and film photography grew astronomically from this point forward using the M3. I\u2019m firmly in the camp of people who feel Leica nailed it on their first attempt at the M with the M3 and it remains THE greatest M ever released that all others that have come since attempt to live up to. Last year, I was looking for another M that had a built-in light meter and was fortunate enough to acquire a mint-condition black 2002 Leica M6 TTL for a great price again ($1400) from its original owner (a close colleague). The combination of the M3 & M6 made me want to have that same analog M-experience but in the digital world. However, digital M\u2019s always seemed foolish and cost-prohibitive to me. Instead, I tried adapting my M-mount glass onto my Fujifilm X-Pro 3. Although it worked and was able to produce some great images, it did not provide that digital M experience I was desiring. For the past 10+ months or so, I began actively looking at trying to acquire a digital M at a reasonable price that I could justify and afford and doing as much research as I could on what camera made the most sense (M 240? M10? M8 or M9?). I love the design, features, and feel of the M10 (and its variants) for all of the reasons you mentioned and was hoping to pick one up if the right price came along. I finally found a used black M10 at my local camera shop a few months back for $5500, which seemed pretty reasonable for the condition and age of the camera. This was still outside of my price range but I felt I could figure out a way to afford it and justify the purchase as it would be my future-proofed digital M that I would own for the next 6-10 years (or until it stopped working and was no longer able to be serviced). I came as close to owning it as having it rung up at the register but ultimately didn\u2019t swipe the credit card as logical thinking (thankfully) popped into my head and I just couldn\u2019t justify the price and walked away. Also, the M10-R had just been released and I figured the prices of the M10 will continue to come down over the next year or so as more M10 owners trade up to the M10-R or other variants. I was back in my local camera shop last week picking up some other gear for a wedding I helped shoot over the weekend. As I always do when in there, I took a look at what used Leica gear they had in stock. I noticed they had a used \u201cDemo\u201d silver Leica M 240 for $3300. Turned out that this was actually a \u201cBrand New\u201d M 240 that had never even been opened or used but since this model has since been discontinued by Leica for a couple of years now, the camera store could no longer sell it as new and had to list it as \u201cUsed - Demo\u201d at a significantly marked down price. I was never too excited about the M240 based on what I read and heard about the bulkiness of it compared to the film Ms/M10; it\u2019s relatively poor high-ISO performance beyond 3200; and also the fact that it was an 8 year old camera. However, after holding it in my hands, I can say that the 4mm size difference, although noticeable, is NOT as significant as I had been led to believe before holding it in my hands. I also realized that whenever I shoot film or even my Fujifilm digital cameras, I rarely shoot above ISO 1600 and instead adjust my aperture or shutter speed to compensate if I need to let in more light. I have also read a lot of reviews and forums of other people saying that the difference in capability between the M240 and the M10 (for many) is not significant enough to justify the $2000-3000 price difference. I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to test the camera out for myself and was able to rent the camera last weekend. Although I previously was very hesitant to even consider an 8-year old camera, after getting a chance to shoot it for several days, I came away realizing that the price and performance were perfect for my needs and would fill my digital M desires. I\u2019ve been thrilled with several of the images I was able to produce with the camera. When I went to return the camera rental on Monday, I instead negotiated the price down a bit from $3300 and traded in one fo my Fujifilm cameras (X-H1) for credit towards it and walked back out of there with a brand new M 240 for $2500! I will say a few things I did notice with the camera that were annoyances but not deal breakers (For me): - The menus are a little clunky and not the simplest to navigate to the features used most (compared to the streamlined, simple design of the M10 menus) - The layout of the buttons and menus and how you navigate them to change certain settings is different than any of my previous digital camera so it\u2019s taking a little getting used to. Annoying but something that will become second nature the more time I spend shooting and playing around with the camera. - It is true that you will experience high noise and banding in poorly lit situations where you have to use ISO 3200-6400. I experienced this using the camera last weekend in a poorly lit wedding reception hall. However, like previously stated, I rarely find myself in conditions like this where I shoot above ISO 1600 and the images shot between ISO 200 - 1600 came out just fine with minimal noise and no signs of banding. Your mileage may vary depending on what you typically shoot - The 1GB buffer is a little small (especially coming from newer, faster digital cameras) and fills up fast if you do shoot in continuous mode. I rarely shoot in this style and would likely use one of my other digital Fujifilm cameras for situations like this so not a big deal for me but worth mentioning. My recommendation for you would be to try and rent or borrow a copy of an M 240 and an M10, spending a couple of days shooting both to get a true idea of what each camera feels like and is capable of. Check out the RAW files and JPEGS and try out a couple different lenses (if you can) on both cameras, seeing how those lenses render on each. If you find (like I did) that the M 240 is able to achieve 90+% of what the M10 can and meet your needs for a digital M, I\u2019d suggest trying to pick up an M 240 in good/great condition and price and put that extra money in your budget towards investing in a some decent glass, especially if you do not already own any M-mount lenses. I have a mix of Leica (40mm Summicron-C, 90mm Elmarit), Zeiss (28 Biogon f2.8, 50 Planar f2), and Voigtlander (35mm f1.4 Nocton Classic II) glass and each lens is great in its own right. Sure, the case can be made for the superiority of Leica glass above all others, but IMHO, the difference is negligible to most people, especially when you look at the price difference. My budget does not justify the 10-fold price difference of the 35mm Summilux vs the 35mm 1.4 Nocton Classic II nor do I think I would produce an image that is 10x better as a result of using the former over the latter. This is not to say they are identical or that the summilux is not a great lens; it absolutely IS a fantastic lens but I feel you could put the same budget you\u2019d spend on a used copy of one ($3000-4000) towards building a complete kit with some great glass from Zeiss, Voigtlander, or even older Leica lenses. I do hope to one day purchase the M10 (or M10-P, M10-D, or M10-R) but the current prices, even used, remain too high for my needs and use case to justify spending that money. Hopefully in 2-4 years, I\u2019ll be in a position where I come across a great condition copy of a used M10-variant for a price I can\u2019t turn down and be able to add it to my bag! I know this was extremely lengthy but hopefully it will be helpful for you (and others that may see this later on) and gave you some perspective on my camera journey and what ultimately made me choose the M 240 over the M 10 (for now, in 2020). Please keep us updated on what you ultimately end up deciding to do! Best of luck on your Leica search! P.S.

i find evfs very helpful on occasion i lean toward the m10 because: significantly thinner better performance future-proofing wifi. i love being out and about and being able to transfer a photo to my phone and instantly edit and share. my x100 has this and i love it. any thoughts?? this is my first time posting/replying in this forum so i apologize if this reply is too lengthy or goes against the rules (moderators - please correct me for future posts). however, i was just in a similar (but slightly different) situation as you jinesh and felt i needed to weigh in... i began with canon digital point and shoots in early 2000s, \u201cgraduated\u201c to a canon 60d dslr in 2011 as a college graduation present to myself, and then got my first fujifilm camera (x100t) at the end of 2014. the x100t changed my whole love for and approach to photography, becoming more slow and deliberate like you mentioned it did for you. it remains one of the most important pieces of gear i ever purchased as it changed so much for me. over the next few years, i sold off all of my canon gear and fully switched over to fujifilm, acquiring 5 more fujifilm cameras (x-t20, x-t2, x-h1, x-pro3, and x100v) from 2015-2020. i still use and love fujifilm and the latest x100v is my favorite digital camera i\u2019ve ever owned. i also began shooting film a few years back and always held the leica m3 as my dream camera that i would love to some day own. as luck would have it, around my 30th birthday, i was able to acquire a mint-condition ss 1959 m3 from the original owner (an older gentleman who owned a local camera shop near me) for an incredible price ($800). my love for leica and film photography grew astronomically from this point forward using the m3. i\u2019m firmly in the camp of people who feel leica nailed it on their first attempt at the m with the m3 and it remains the greatest m ever released that all others that have come since attempt to live up to. last year, i was looking for another m that had a built-in light meter and was fortunate enough to acquire a mint-condition black 2002 leica m6 ttl for a great price again ($1400) from its original owner (a close colleague). the combination of the m3 & m6 made me want to have that same analog m-experience but in the digital world. however, digital m\u2019s always seemed foolish and cost-prohibitive to me. instead, i tried adapting my m-mount glass onto my fujifilm x-pro 3. although it worked and was able to produce some great images, it did not provide that digital m experience i was desiring. for the past 10+ months or so, i began actively looking at trying to acquire a digital m at a reasonable price that i could justify and afford and doing as much research as i could on what camera made the most sense (m 240? m10? m8 or m9?). i love the design, features, and feel of the m10 (and its variants) for all of the reasons you mentioned and was hoping to pick one up if the right price came along. i finally found a used black m10 at my local camera shop a few months back for $5500, which seemed pretty reasonable for the condition and age of the camera. this was still outside of my price range but i felt i could figure out a way to afford it and justify the purchase as it would be my future-proofed digital m that i would own for the next 6-10 years (or until it stopped working and was no longer able to be serviced). i came as close to owning it as having it rung up at the register but ultimately didn\u2019t swipe the credit card as logical thinking (thankfully) popped into my head and i just couldn\u2019t justify the price and walked away. also, the m10-r had just been released and i figured the prices of the m10 will continue to come down over the next year or so as more m10 owners trade up to the m10-r or other variants. i was back in my local camera shop last week picking up some other gear for a wedding i helped shoot over the weekend. as i always do when in there, i took a look at what used leica gear they had in stock. i noticed they had a used \u201cdemo\u201d silver leica m 240 for $3300. turned out that this was actually a \u201cbrand new\u201d m 240 that had never even been opened or used but since this model has since been discontinued by leica for a couple of years now, the camera store could no longer sell it as new and had to list it as \u201cused - demo\u201d at a significantly marked down price. i was never too excited about the m240 based on what i read and heard about the bulkiness of it compared to the film ms/m10; it\u2019s relatively poor high-iso performance beyond 3200; and also the fact that it was an 8 year old camera. however, after holding it in my hands, i can say that the 4mm size difference, although noticeable, is not as significant as i had been led to believe before holding it in my hands. i also realized that whenever i shoot film or even my fujifilm digital cameras, i rarely shoot above iso 1600 and instead adjust my aperture or shutter speed to compensate if i need to let in more light. i have also read a lot of reviews and forums of other people saying that the difference in capability between the m240 and the m10 (for many) is not significant enough to justify the $2000-3000 price difference. i figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to test the camera out for myself and was able to rent the camera last weekend. although i previously was very hesitant to even consider an 8-year old camera, after getting a chance to shoot it for several days, i came away realizing that the price and performance were perfect for my needs and would fill my digital m desires. i\u2019ve been thrilled with several of the images i was able to produce with the camera. when i went to return the camera rental on monday, i instead negotiated the price down a bit from $3300 and traded in one fo my fujifilm cameras (x-h1) for credit towards it and walked back out of there with a brand new m 240 for $2500! i will say a few things i did notice with the camera that were annoyances but not deal breakers (for me): - the menus are a little clunky and not the simplest to navigate to the features used most (compared to the streamlined, simple design of the m10 menus) - the layout of the buttons and menus and how you navigate them to change certain settings is different than any of my previous digital camera so it\u2019s taking a little getting used to. annoying but something that will become second nature the more time i spend shooting and playing around with the camera. - it is true that you will experience high noise and banding in poorly lit situations where you have to use iso 3200-6400. i experienced this using the camera last weekend in a poorly lit wedding reception hall. however, like previously stated, i rarely find myself in conditions like this where i shoot above iso 1600 and the images shot between iso 200 - 1600 came out just fine with minimal noise and no signs of banding. your mileage may vary depending on what you typically shoot - the 1gb buffer is a little small (especially coming from newer, faster digital cameras) and fills up fast if you do shoot in continuous mode. i rarely shoot in this style and would likely use one of my other digital fujifilm cameras for situations like this so not a big deal for me but worth mentioning. my recommendation for you would be to try and rent or borrow a copy of an m 240 and an m10, spending a couple of days shooting both to get a true idea of what each camera feels like and is capable of. check out the raw files and jpegs and try out a couple different lenses (if you can) on both cameras, seeing how those lenses render on each. if you find (like i did) that the m 240 is able to achieve 90+% of what the m10 can and meet your needs for a digital m, i\u2019d suggest trying to pick up an m 240 in good/great condition and price and put that extra money in your budget towards investing in a some decent glass, especially if you do not already own any m-mount lenses. i have a mix of leica (40mm summicron-c, 90mm elmarit), zeiss (28 biogon f2.8, 50 planar f2), and voigtlander (35mm f1.4 nocton classic ii) glass and each lens is great in its own right. sure, the case can be made for the superiority of leica glass above all others, but imho, the difference is negligible to most people, especially when you look at the price difference. my budget does not justify the 10-fold price difference of the 35mm summilux vs the 35mm 1.4 nocton classic ii nor do i think i would produce an image that is 10x better as a result of using the former over the latter. this is not to say they are identical or that the summilux is not a great lens; it absolutely is a fantastic lens but i feel you could put the same budget you\u2019d spend on a used copy of one ($3000-4000) towards building a complete kit with some great glass from zeiss, voigtlander, or even older leica lenses. i do hope to one day purchase the m10 (or m10-p, m10-d, or m10-r) but the current prices, even used, remain too high for my needs and use case to justify spending that money. hopefully in 2-4 years, i\u2019ll be in a -----> position !!!  where i come across a great condition copy of a used m10-variant for a price i can\u2019t turn down and be able to add it to my bag! i know this was extremely lengthy but hopefully it will be helpful for you (and others that may see this later on) and gave you some perspective on my camera journey and what ultimately made me choose the m 240 over the m 10 (for now, in 2020). please keep us updated on what you ultimately end up deciding to do! best of luck on your leica search! p.s. benj haisch is a leica wedding photographer based in the northwest who has some great videos on youtube regarding the practicality of using the m 240 in 2020 that you might want to check out. he also recently upgraded to a pair of m 10s and had recently listed his m 240s up for sale for a pretty reasonable price on twitter. might be worth checking out if you decide to go the m 240 route.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 15067, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 354868, "autor": "Good To Be Retired", "date": 1598973780000, "content": "On 8/27/2020 at 12:17 PM, WPCello said: I generally use an E.

Different arguments can be made for the benefit/drawback of using filters for lens element protection, with examples sited where a lens was saved by a filter or a lens could possibly have been damaged by a filter. My purely personal viewpoint is that the best procedure would be to avoid cheap filters, select filters with modern coatings, and be aware that certain situations are more likely to cause problems than others. Using filters at night, for instance, may increase the opportunity for increased reflections from the additional glass surface. I rather prefer clear glass filters on digital rather than UV/Skylight filters, which were originally used to correct specific issues when using color film. If you're a film shooter then depending on your shooting situation a UV filter may be a better choice than a clear one. My suggestion, however, is that rather than give overly much consideration to my opinion or anybody else's, is to test for yourself.

Yes; the function of the coding is to allow for EXIF data and in-camera lens correction. The 6-bit code IS recognised by the camera - there is an elongated 'wndow' on the lens-mount on the body at the 5 o'clock position which reads the code - but this only tells the camera which lens is attached; nothing more. The reason that no exact aperture data can be recorded is because there is no 'information' connection between the lens' aperture ring and the camera body - either physical or electrical - and so there is no way that the setting can be known by the camera. With the majority of recent non-coded lenses the model of lens can usually be selected in the appropriate drop-down menu if the option is set to Manual instead of Auto.

The lockups seem to occur when I forget to turn off the battery for an extended period while walking. I may have an electrical/thermal problem that can be offset temporarily by turning the battery off after every single photo is taken. The camera has had daily use since it arrived and I suspect that the camera does not deal well with the heat from constant use. Otherwise it is the best camera that I have had. Will report any findings here. Happy shooting to all. Do you happen to use Live View at all? The camera should go to sleep, so leaving it on shouldn't be any concern, as far as I know. I do turn it off occasionally while out shooting, but also leave it on. 9 hours ago, setuporg said: Really not sure why one would use Live View. Except for 24mm or wider or 90mm or longer. On the M246 there's video and it's actually useful for video... Ahhh, a purist of another sort! Here's what I love about Live View: 1. The Level Gauge for landscape photography. 2. The ability to shoot from higher, lower, and leaning positions. 3. The histogram preview with half shutter press (this is probably my primary satisfaction). 4. Highlighted clipping both high and low helps to balance out exactly where you choose to position the histogram. 5. Critical focus when choosing where and how to move the range of focus, or to ensure your absolutely required focus. 6. Careful positioning of the edges of the frame.

It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to pro actively replace the sensor in your case (my opinion). Even if it does eventually get corroded, the entire image isn\u2019t ruined. You can easily fix in PP just like you do with dust spots. This is my recommendation because it sounds like you may end up selling the camera and you won\u2019t recoup the $2k plus whatever you bought it for if you do in fact sell it. the M9 and especially the MM1 is the best way to enter the M system on a Budget because the IQ still stacks up, and the camera is pretty much as low as it will go for depreciation. The MM1 produces beautiful files that are almost as good as the M10M in my view, and better than the M246. the Leica certificate program has been around for at least as long as I\u2019ve been a photographer (8 years). They just changed the marketing of it. Any time Leica works on your camera they provide 12 months warranty for adjustment.

And Sony explicitly claims that its a7riv camera rivals medium-format cameras. In this test, I compare side-by-side the Leica M10P (24 MP, color) with the M10M (41 MP, monochrome), the Sony a7riv (61 MP, color), and the \u201cfull-frame medium format\u201d (54 x 40 mm sensor) Phase One IQ4 (151 MP, color), currently the largest and highest-resolution imaging sensor available to most photographers. (Note that the 102-MP Fuji GFX-100 has a cropped (44 x 33 mm) version of the Sony-manufactured sensor In the IQ4.) For each camera, I used the very best available lens at the best-quality aperture and at base ISO. Test conditions: Leica M10P + Leica APO 50 Summicron at f/5.6, ISO 100 Leica M10M + Leica APO 50 Summicron at f/5.6, ISO 160 Sony a7riv + Sony 85/1.4 GM at f/5.6, ISO 100 Phase One IQ4 + Rodenstock HR90 at f/9, ISO 100 (yes, the base ISO of the IQ4 is 100, not 50). Shooting the IQ4 at f/9 gives a comparable depth of focus as shooting the other cameras at f/5.6. I know from my other tests, and from discussions with Phase One dealers, that at f/9 diffraction is not limiting in practice for the IQ4 sensor (though it can be limiting at apertures smaller than f/9). Everything was shot on a tripod with 2-3-second release delay to avoid shake, at subject distances to give similar subject size and position. Note that the aspect ratio of the IQ4 sensor is 4:3, rather than 3:2 like the other sensors, so I used frame width to match framing. Since I was shooting the IQ4 on a technical camera, all four cameras were mirrorless, with no risk of mirror slap vibrations spoiling sharpness. Raw files were exposure-matched and converted to monochrome using Capture One 20. Then each converted max-quality JPEG was auto-bicubic-scaled in Photoshop to either 7864 pixels wide (the width of native M10M images) or to 14204 pixels wide (the width of native IQ4 images).

Click on the image to see the comparison full-size. I choose to use the scaled-up 14204-pixel-wide images since one goal of this test is to determine if any of these imaging systems can approach medium format quality, not to test if they can approach down-sized medium format quality. You can build analogous matrices from the smaller images as well using the files in the above link if you would like. Summary of findings: 1) As expected, all of these four imaging systems with optimum glass, ISO, and aperture produce excellent images at their native sizes. 2) The Bayer CFA-less M10M does indeed punch above its megapixel weight. With respect to capturing subject details, I found the M10M (41 MP) and Sony a7riv (61 MP) to be virtually identical. In fact, to my eye the M10M+50 APO was able to capture slightly more details than the a7riv+85 GM\u2014compare the lint on the upper grey band of the vessel in the attached matrix. 3) The Phase One IQ4 eats all the competitors for lunch if you compare image quality at 100%. But a 14,204-pixel-wide image printed at 200 dpi is 6 feet wide (!). At any practical viewing distance (assuming you don\u2019t need to crop heavily), I would say that the IQ4, M10M, and a7riv are actually quite similar, even when scaling up the latter two images to the 14,204 pixel width of the IQ4 image. Which is pretty cool. 4) The M10P, as you might expect for a 24-MP camera thrown into a resolution and sharpness gunfight, lags well behind the others, but even so, once I view the M10P image at about 50% magnification it begins to look quite similar to the other images. 5) In terms of bang for the buck, Sony offers outstanding value, as usual. The Sony a7riv + 85 GM lens costs ~$5,200. Either Leica body + the 50 APO costs ~$17,000. And the Phase One IQ4 + Rodenstock HR90 costs around $55,000. And the Sony is the only one of the four tested systems that offers autofocus. So can the Leica M10M or the Sony a7riv offer image quality rivaling that of state-of-the-art digital medium format systems? Yes, at practical viewing sizes and distances, when using optimal glass.

(note that the 102-mp fuji gfx-100 has a cropped (44 x 33 mm) version of the sony-manufactured sensor in the iq4.) for each camera, i used the very best available lens at the best-quality aperture and at base iso. test conditions: leica m10p + leica apo 50 summicron at f/5.6, iso 100 leica m10m + leica apo 50 summicron at f/5.6, iso 160 sony a7riv + sony 85/1.4 gm at f/5.6, iso 100 phase one iq4 + rodenstock hr90 at f/9, iso 100 (yes, the base iso of the iq4 is 100, not 50). shooting the iq4 at f/9 gives a comparable depth of focus as shooting the other cameras at f/5.6. i know from my other tests, and from discussions with phase one dealers, that at f/9 diffraction is not limiting in practice for the iq4 sensor (though it can be limiting at apertures smaller than f/9). everything was shot on a tripod with 2-3-second release delay to avoid shake, at subject distances to give similar subject size and -----> position !!! . note that the aspect ratio of the iq4 sensor is 4:3, rather than 3:2 like the other sensors, so i used frame width to match framing. since i was shooting the iq4 on a technical camera, all four cameras were mirrorless, with no risk of mirror slap vibrations spoiling sharpness. raw files were exposure-matched and converted to monochrome using capture one 20. then each converted max-quality jpeg was auto-bicubic-scaled in photoshop to either 7864 pixels wide (the width of native m10m images) or to 14204 pixels wide (the width of native iq4 images). you can download all the raw files and full-resolution max-quality jpeg files here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/scvrfg8h41naux4/aadw8cfm37db2bwkgtbie3m2a?dl=0 a tiny 100% crop from near the center of the 14204 pixel-wide images was composited into a matrix for comparison, attached to this post. click on the image to see the comparison full-size. i choose to use the scaled-up 14204-pixel-wide images since one goal of this test is to determine if any of these imaging systems can approach medium format quality, not to test if they can approach down-sized medium format quality. you can build analogous matrices from the smaller images as well using the files in the above link if you would like. summary of findings: 1) as expected, all of these four imaging systems with optimum glass, iso, and aperture produce excellent images at their native sizes. 2) the bayer cfa-less m10m does indeed punch above its megapixel weight. with respect to capturing subject details, i found the m10m (41 mp) and sony a7riv (61 mp) to be virtually identical. in fact, to my eye the m10m+50 apo was able to capture slightly more details than the a7riv+85 gm\u2014compare the lint on the upper grey band of the vessel in the attached matrix. 3) the phase one iq4 eats all the competitors for lunch if you compare image quality at 100%. but a 14,204-pixel-wide image printed at 200 dpi is 6 feet wide (!). at any practical viewing distance (assuming you don\u2019t need to crop heavily), i would say that the iq4, m10m, and a7riv are actually quite similar, even when scaling up the latter two images to the 14,204 pixel width of the iq4 image. which is pretty cool. 4) the m10p, as you might expect for a 24-mp camera thrown into a resolution and sharpness gunfight, lags well behind the others, but even so, once i view the m10p image at about 50% magnification it begins to look quite similar to the other images. 5) in terms of bang for the buck, sony offers outstanding value, as usual. the sony a7riv + 85 gm lens costs ~$5,200. either leica body + the 50 apo costs ~$17,000. and the phase one iq4 + rodenstock hr90 costs around $55,000. and the sony is the only one of the four tested systems that offers autofocus. so can the leica m10m or the sony a7riv offer image quality rivaling that of state-of-the-art digital medium format systems? yes, at practical viewing sizes and distances, when using optimal glass. but if pixel peeping or (very) large prints are your target application, then medium format, for now, has no peer. thanks for doing this test. is there a reason why you did not include the m246?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 27623, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 366770, "autor": "Keith (M)", "date": 1580215200000, "content": "Did he tell you your position on the waiting list and any expected delivery date?

With the M9, If you used a 0.60mm coverglass, then you would want to compensate by moving the sensor forward. There are shims between the sensor and camera chassis so one could make a pretty good guess that you need to move the sensor about 0.10mm closer. You would have to remove one or more of the stock shims and make your own to replace. While I do have precision thickness metal sheets, I am really not sure that I would advise on going that route. To make sure the sensor is in the right position, you need a special machine. I think you are better off leaving the sensor in it stock position, but it is your camera to do as you see fit. I don't know of anyone in Europe offering a fix. As far as I know, it is just us (MaxMax) and Kolari though I would like to see photographic proof from Kolari If you send a camera from outside the USA, you want to include a $1 invoice that says you are sending the camera in for repair.

Detailed breakdown: Take my recommendation like any recommendation. With a handful of salt. it\u2019s always important to understand the context of how an output is derived (for me anyhow). What\u2019s important for you, may not for me. I have documented my \u201cmethodology\u201d on how I have went my way on making my own personal determination, that\u2019s aligned with how I use the camera. My \u201cTest\u201d parameters: 1 - lenses (only Leica) -Leica 50mm (type iv) -Leica 35mm 1.4 (pre-ASPH) -I do have a 7artisan lens, but I\u2019ll keep my \u201ctest shots\u201d using only Leica lenses -I won\u2019t be trying on any other lenses, as I don\u2019t have any.. happy to accept any donations (joke!) -Refer to EXIF data to see which lens 2 - Aperture will range from F2 - F10 -I don\u2019t shoot at F16 so I will only be shooting where I normally shoot at.. more specifically where I wasn\u2019t able to shoot with great confident due to the sensor -EXIF data should be visible in google photos 3 - Raw only -No jpegs and raw files won\u2019t be provided -Files will be processed to my liking but I\u2019ll have 2 albums.. one for processed and another one straight out of camera (LR raw conversion no edits) -My definition of \u201cprocessed\u201d: Adjustment for exposure, shadows, highlight, white balance (if it\u2019s not accurate), so technically if you compare the \u201cnon-processed\u201d albums you will see a difference My testing phases: To make a determination, there needs to be a set of tests that gets undertaken to support the claim. These tests take a considerable amount of time to prepare and perform. My process is fairly informal and I\u2019ll start with what\u2019s personally important to me. -Phase 1 - Park photography (initial assessment) -Phase 2 - Family and friends (todo) -Phase 3 - Urban photography (todo) -Phase 4 - Street Photography (todo) In the future as I have more time to perform \u201ctest shots\u201d, I\u2019ll add more pictures into the existing albums My assessment process I\u2019ll outline what\u2019s important for me, there are a lot of limitations.. due to lack of controls in my testing methodology. 1 - Colours/colors ? Technically if you wanted to do a proper comparison you would have at a minimum 3 x Leica M9 Original sensor Sensor replaced by Leica Fixed sensor from company A Fixed sensor from company B Shoot a colour/color chart and then do a three way comparison, let people vote and then present the results (would be fun) Unfortunately I won\u2019t be doing that, and therefore it will be fairly subjective. I don\u2019t have a control mechanism or plan on defining one. I \u201conly\u201d have 1 x Leica M camera and that\u2019s the M9. Additionally No. I won\u2019t be comparing it to another camera that I have (e.g iPhone 11, Sony, Fujifilm, Nikon), as that would be detracting from my goal. 2 - Corner sharpness (exclusion) I won\u2019t be discussing this, as it\u2019s not my main goal of shooting with a Leica M9. If this is really important to you, it\u2019s best you wait for proper review. From my perspective there are modern lenses and sensors that can better deliver the edge to edge sharpness that you might desire. The purpose of my tests are to satisfy how I use my M9 and not a full 360 degree assessment trying to cater every photographer out there. Basically in short. No. I won\u2019t be shooting brick walls. 3 - Impacts to low light (exclusion) I won\u2019t be commenting on this directly again as I shoot at iso 640 (max) and then push the raw files in post. Additionally Kolar vision has put out a statement mentioning a 1/4 stop loss of light. If you want to challenge this claim in a \u201ctightly controlled\u201d environment, you will need multiple M9\u2019s. I will accept Kolar Vision\u2019s claim. 4 - AWB (auto white balance) colour shifts I\u2019ll discuss briefly what I observed to the white balance, I tend to be pleased with the original sensor AWB. I\u2019ll also take note of any noticeable color/colour shifts. For reference when I used my M9, I would only do \u201cminor\u201d adjustments and rarely modify the colours as I was relatively happy with the raw look. Additionally kolar vision also provides modifications to A7/fujifilm for a thinner sensor stack.. this had significantly impacted the AWB. So this might be a deal breaker for some M9 users who don\u2019t want to modify WB in raw OR shoot with JPEG. I\u2019ll report my personal findings. 5 - Fix for the corrosion I\u2019ll comment on if I can see any \u201cvisible\u201d signs on the actual sensor in addition to any artefacts at F8-F10. 6 - Focus calibrated ? As the camera had to be dismantled during the process, I\u2019ll check if the camera has been calibrated correctly for my lenses: 35 and 50mm 7 - Skin tones (partially included) Will take more time (so you might need to wait till someone else shares their findings). Technically you will need to shoot a wide variety of different skin colours.. if I was a professional photographer doing portrait work.. catering for a diverse market .. it would be fairly easy to test . But I am not. My background Like any advice it\u2019s important to have context about the source, and it helps to get abit more of an insight about \u201cme\u201d. -no affiliation with Kolari Vision -first time customer -I live in Australia -I work in the IT industry (software engineer/App design/problem solving) -Amateur photographer (10 years) official job title is \u201cInstagram husband - Augustine.sidik\u201d -Shoot about approximately 40k frames a year -I rotate my camera and lenses weekly, so I don\u2019t exclusively shoot with Leica (Nikon,Sony,Fujifilm, Leica) -I use LR classic -Photography genre: tend to shoot everything except for brick walls -I got a young family, so time is pretty limited APPENDIX / MISC / Custom & duties As I live in Australia, outlined below was my experience with customs etc -Getting it there (Australia Post Express) I wanted to insure it, however It was enforced that the insured amount should be close to the actual declared value. I ended up sending it to Kolari vision uninsured and declared the camera as $1. I didn\u2019t want to be stung by customs and duties, as I have heard situations where even if the parcel was marked as \u201crepairs\u201d.. customs still applied (in US). -Wait time Communication with Kolari Vision was great, I didn\u2019t have any major issues. It was highlighted that they have been inundated with more orders. However that just meant it was going to take abit longer. -My timeline 15/09/20 Payment made to Kolari Vision 17/09/20 Camera was sent (Aus -> USA) 22/09/20 Camera received 10/10/20 Camera processed/Order completed 12/10/20 Payment made to DHL (AUS Custom & duties) 13/10/20 Camera received (USA->AUS) -Getting the camera back (custom and duties) As part of the service, the camera was delivered via DHL. All custom & duties will be paid by the customer (me). The camera was insured for $ 1000 USD. DHL sent me an email requesting additional clarification. Specifically how much was the camera worth prior to repair ? As I had sent it to US uninsured and specified the value as $1.00 in the end I had to pay $247.99 AUD (breakdown below) Cost breakdown: GST ON IMPORTATION (TX) - $137.99 AUST GOVT CHARGES (L1) - $88.00 DISBURSEMENT FEE (AV) - $20.00 GST - $2.00 Total - $247.99 + 1.1% credit card fee Note: using bank transfer will require payment to be cleared prior to item being released -Why kolar vision ? (warning: highly subjective) Prior to the M9 repair announcement, I was already researching (due to curiosity) their IR conversion, in addition to \u201cultra thin sensor stack\u201d for Sony. All these services were all well received (based on my research) from (my) trusted online sources. I assumed that at this point they had performed a fair amount of \u201creplacing/removal of sensor glass\u201d at scale, and were in a good position to capitalise their expertise on addressing the M9 issues. Additionally If there were something to go wrong with my repair, as with any forms of repairs there would be a recourse. But yes it was a gamble as there weren\u2019t any reviews\u2026. given how new the servicing offering is.. Was it worth it ? After spending around $1,850 AUD when you including the shipping and duties.. that\u2019s a considerably amount of money (for me anyhow). I never did it for financial gain (buy a cheap M9 + repair to flip for a profit), the fix based on my preliminary testing delivers the results I wanted. Closing statements Hope you found this useful. If it hasn\u2019t, then you may want to get your camera repaired and share your own personal opinions.

I am also new to Leica products and I get a second hand M10. After one month of usage my M10 is out of focus and after reading the whole 14 pages of this thread I still have 2 questions to see if anyone could help: 1. Infinity of my rangefinder is off. When using an allen key to turn the roller clockwise (when the camera is upside down), the arm doesn't move and it is easier to adjust.

I suppose they did this because it is better in theory to have a little more in your photo than you expected when you take the photo, than to have a little less (and run the risk of cutting heads off etc). But I find that as might be expected, the 35mm framelines are closer to the 40mm field of view of the lens being only 5mm off (not sure what this represents in degrees of angle but it's tiny in practice). I have since sold my Nokton classic (mainly because I had a chance to buy a nice Voigtlander 35mm f1.2 and developed G.A.S. for it) but when I had it my solution was simple - to check framing I simply used the frame selector lever, flicked it to the 35mm/28mm position and checked how my framing corresponds to the 35mm lines.

I still do something of this sort for another lens I own - the Leica Summaron 35mm f3.5 which in its earlier M mount form was designed for the M3 and hence brings up the 50mm framelines on any M camera instead of 35mm (the M3 lacks 35mm framelines).

On the whole it had been a great camera to use over the years and was still in very good cosmetic condition. But in terms of operation had ultimately reached a point where it needed several things addressed. These were seemingly minor issues like those you mentioned; viewfinder flare, temperamental DX reader and contacts on the ISO dial. The camera was still usable, but all these things start to add up and became a bit irritating to work around at times. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the frame counter not returning to zero. In my case, the repair estimate to have everything done was almost halfway towards buying a new M film body. It would have also meant being without the camera for an unspecified amount of time. My decision was to sell the M7. Additional reasons for deciding to sell the M7 were; shutter speed dial goes in opposite direction to the other film M bodies I\u2019m interested in using together. (M-A, MP and M3.) The M7 did pair well with a digital M body, but I no longer have a digital M and currently unsure if or when I may buy a new digital M. (There are times I have to use digital, but not a fan of the CMOS sensor aesthetic at all. It's a have to use, not want to use. Which greatly reduces the desire to spend the asking price of a new digital M.) Depending on where you are in the world at any given time, I found the batteries for the M7 can also be very hard to obtain. You can buy extra when you find them and always try to carry spares, but sometimes things happen and you find yourself in a pinch. I had to resort to being limited to the 2 mechanical shutter speed settings on occasion with the M7. With a fully mechanical camera like the MP you lose the meter function, but can still shoot at all shutter speeds. For the other meterless cameras batteries are just one less thing to worry about. In this day an age there\u2019s often something close to hand to use in lieu of an internal meter if really needed. Smart phone, other digital camera and of course external / small pocket light meters. Having no internal meter is also good practice, slows you down and can result in paying more attention to scenes and conditions. It\u2019s good for keeping you on your toes. The reasons to keep the M7 might have been aperture priority mode and the higher shutter speeds offered by the electronically controlled shutter. Personally, I always kept the camera in manual exposure mode and very rarely used the highest shutter speeds. So they weren\u2019t strong reasons to hold onto the M7. Time will tell if I miss the higher shutter speed settings. The final decision to sell was largely made by wanting to end up with a pair of mechanical film bodies that share uniform controls.

So much time, so little to do or think about.

Initially, this presented an almost irresistible photographic challenge and leanings towards a kind of Spartan self-discipline \u2013 how to get great\u2026 well, at least OK, photographs given the constraints. Well, that didn\u2019t last long. So of course, as it does in such times, the mind turns from artistic challenge to matters of GAS. Money being short, cameras and lenses were out of the question. I\u2019d seen our good friend Pritam (Suede) here using a grip on his M4 \u2013 it looked good, and it seemed practical - and thus a grip for the M cameras presented itself as a reasonable acquisition. Knockoffs on the auction site were going for $100 or so. Then of course the internet, being what it is, served up a more tempting (read, more expensive) option: a grip, beautifully designed and built in France, and finished with a lovely piece of walnut. Well, this was just too perfect for words \u2013 for a year, my family had lived in rural France \u2013 on a farm that produced walnuts. We\u2019d come to love those gracious trees very much and so the chance to sport the beautifully grained wood harvested from a fallen tree on one of my Leicas \u2013 well, that of course meant that the budget had to head north. --img--  I contacted Vincent Bihler https://www.kamerakraft.com/ and received a reply straight away \u2013 in fact this has been the case each time I\u2019ve contacted him, and he has always been helpful, polite and thoughtful.

Well, as these things do, what with one thing or another it took some time longer than expected for the grips to be ready, but once it was Vincent sent it straight out and I received it a remarkably short time after \u2013 a lovely, light anodized aluminium grip with a gorgeous chunk of walnut. Now it turns out that Vincent is a very clever designer, having designed many other things, photographic and otherwise \u2013 from baby high chairs to bus stop shelters (he has a very space-age looking film scanning carrier in the works for instance). The design aesthetic here is full of attention to detail and meticulous thought. Being a very accomplished photographer himself, Vincent had designed-in a couple of touches that really made the grip stand out as a useful tool \u2013 space for spare batteries for one, and tripod slots on the base that marry with a standard Arca tripod mount. Cool. There\u2019s even a wrist-strap lug built into it. --img--  The LMGrip is compatible with every film Leica M except the M5. It fits onto my M6TTLs and M2 as if it were original equipment. In use, my own experience is that it has taken a bit of getting used to. This is mainly due to having to adopt a lightly different method of gripping the camera. For horizontal shots without the grip, I find I tuck a good deal of my pinky finger (there must be a technical term better than pinky) under the base of the camera for stability and because that finger finds it needs somewhere to go. The M body allows this quite naturally. With the grip, which adds 7 or 8mm to the height of the body, my pinky finds it is happier to sit with two other fingers gripping the walnut stock. It means I\u2019ll have to be extra vigilant about keeping my fingernails cut as they tend then to seek out the vulcanite body covering, and I don\u2019t want to scratch off the covering. Due to this altered hand placement it also means, overall, that my hand sits higher on the camera body than it does without the grip attached. For me, this is a bonus as it means more of my \u201cpointer\u201d or index finger (I hope everyone knows what I\u2019m talking about) is able to reach the shutter button. With the Abrahamsson soft releases that I use, this makes it considerably easier to ensure that the first joint of my finger is able to press down on the softie to release the shutter \u2013 which, according to Tom Abrahamsson when I first bought them, is the optimal method to use the softie. Paradoxically, the camera also seems a little lighter in the hand with the grip attached, even though the grip adds some mass (with four spare LR44 batteries loaded the grip tips the scales at 92 grams). Don\u2019t ask me why or to quantify that observation - I guess this is because you have a nice protrusion at the front that alters the balance and therefore the perceived load. Also the camera body doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cslippery\u201d with the grip attached, again my guess is because there\u2019s more mass and your fingers are able to grip onto more. Not that the grip itself \u2013 or the wooden bit at least \u2013 is slip-free (it seems about as slippery as the body itself) but the shape allows your hand more touch with the camera + grip than with the camera alone, so you feel assured that it is more secure. --img--  So, my recommendation? It is a well-designed, beautifully crafted piece of kit, well in keeping with the quality and aesthetic appeal of a Leica M film camera. If you are after a grip and 199 Euros for the all-black version or 229 Euros for the walnut stock version is within your comfort zone, I can\u2019t see how you\u2019d fail to be very happy with this grip. I have no doubt it will last as long as any of, and then some, and it will age gracefully (unlike some of us). It takes a little bit of getting used to, as you are enticed to use a slightly different method of holding the camera. The upside of that is that the camera feels more secure and, in my experience at least, your shutter (oops almost wrote shitter) finger aligns in a better position for the soft depression of the shutter button. At best this might even give you an extra stop or so of hand-hold-ability. Now, armed with the LMGrip and free to travel further than 5km, you\u2019d think that the great photos would be just stockpiling at a machine-gun rate. Oh well, you can\u2019t win \u2018em all. The ambition\u2019s great, but perhaps I seriously need to \u201cget a grip\u201d.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/315672-quickish-review-%E2%80%93-kamerakaft-lmgrip-v20/?tab=comments#comment-4090685", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": " ahhh\u2026 lockdown. so much time, so little to do or think about. we were, here, where i live, asked to lockdown in quite a restricted way for quite a long time \u2013 for some months, we had a curfew from 8pm at nights and weren\u2019t allowed at any time to travel more than 5km from home. initially, this presented an almost irresistible photographic challenge and leanings towards a kind of spartan self-discipline \u2013 how to get great\u2026 well, at least ok, photographs given the constraints. well, that didn\u2019t last long. so of course, as it does in such times, the mind turns from artistic challenge to matters of gas. money being short, cameras and lenses were out of the question. i\u2019d seen our good friend pritam (suede) here using a grip on his m4 \u2013 it looked good, and it seemed practical -

A \"jammed camera\", where shutter button would not move, and film advance would not move, but I did not look at the display when this happened but it may have been like yours. FIX From Leica Repair: This unjammed my M7 shutter, the shutter release button, the film advance system, and the electronic system: Leica service told me to put it in Bulb mode, then tap the shutter release a few times to get the shutter release to jump up, since the shutter release is probably jammed in the down position. Apparently, Bulb mode is some kind of shutter-computer reset or starting point. Well that is the best sense I can make of it. Probably the camera needs to be in the power-on position with batteries installed. It is easy to have it turned off when you think it is on. Possibly move the advance lever back & forth a little bit, and turn it off-&-on. I tried so many things that it is hard to remember the exact order of all I tried before following the above directions from Leica. CAUSE: This may have been caused by, my removing the batteries, without first turning the camera power to Off. The M7 has a computer brain that like any computer has a start & stop procedure that seems to include turning the power switch off before removing the batteries. I was sent this picture below which is supposed to be of the M7 Leica IC, integrated circuit, with IC attachment legs which give a long life circuit more so than the modern SMD, surface mount devices, that lack the attachment leg but are only soldered onto the surface. The M7 may last a long time. The M7 is one of Leica's best M cameras feature-wise. I love the M7 for its aperture priority mode which automates shutter timing as the aperture is turned. Aperture priority is all you need really since it makes the camera semi-automatic which means it is under your control and only automating to assist your decisions. Before I got my Leica, I bought a full manual FM Nikon and disliked it compared to the Nikon EL2 which has the same \"auto shutter as your turn the aperture\" as the M7.

At the time I had a 1.4 Summilux as well. An American lady, who was a forum member at the time, asked for comparisons of the 1.4 Summilux versus the APO Summicron. The only fair way I could do that was to mount my M240-P on a tripod and use a flash. Otherwise the light could change and the position could differ. I then took shots from f/1.4 to f/11 using the Summilux, swapped lenses, and took shots from f/2 to f/11 on the Summicron. Without revealing which were which, I asked the rather pedantic lady to do a blind tasting, so to speak. She replied that the shots taken across all apertures were better from one of the lenses. All were deemed by her to be clearer and better defined with the APO Summicron. All I did was photograph a tea caddy in my kitchen. Same light, same position, same focus. I posted about this experiment on here ages ago. Because Google got annoying about my use of Google Photos I deleted all the files. Subsequently I sold the 1.4 Summilux for more than it had cost me.

The first part of my post was about using the camera with an MF lens, and it's been excellent. Yesterday I picked up the SL 35 APO. Here are my thoughts and experience. The lens I used: I don't have much to say. It's hands down the most perfect 35mm I've ever used. The image that comes out of it looks incredible. Sometimes I stare at the photo and cant believe it. I suppose the same can be said about most SL lenses, and the 24-90 as well. They are class leading. IQ is incredible. Ergonomics: It's well built and feels very balanced on the body. It's obviously not the lightest kit but if you're out with the purpose of taking photos, its a total pleasure to use. The SL2S in general is great for hybrid use, once you've set up all the buttons to your liking. One would think that the Sony is faster to operate with all the buttons, but actually the SL2S is way faster. With too many buttons, you end up thinking. With the SL2S, all the buttons are ideally positioned near my fingers, and after just a few hours you start getting muscle memory and operate the camera effortlessly. It's pure Leica simplicity, just efficient and out of your way. Video: I still love the video files I am getting out of the SL2S even without an M lens. The colours are great straight out of camera, and very malleable in 10 bit. I compared the files to the A7SIII. They are not as sharp, but then again the stills capabilities of the SL2S destroy the A7SIII, so it evens up. And they still look very amazing. Low light: After more testing, I confirm that the low light is quite impressive. Both for stills and videos. Clean without losing color. I could never imagine missing my A7SIII. The SL2S performs, in my opinion, better. AF for stills: It's not as snappy and sticky as the Sony's eye detect, but its still more than any photographer really needs. It's fast and accurate, and perfect for my use. I don't need anything more. The only advantage to the Sony is that it performs way better in low light, where the SL2S struggles. AF for video: \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d It's a total disaster. It's ok if your subject is not moving, or for landscape use. But I found it completely unusable with anything that moves. My kids, my dog, people walking in the street. FORGET about it! It's just too unreliable. It hunts, its slow, it doesn't stick. What a horrible AF system for video. My conclusion is that it is just not an option. This is a manual focus camera for video, at least in 90% of my scenarios. It's not a terrible thing but....... To answer my own question in the tittle of the thread, it is not yet the perfect hybrid for me. It's near perfect, but no AF in a 2021 mirrorless is just not acceptable for me, and it is not yet time for me to get rid of my A7SIII, which thanks to the AF is a more versatile and efficient option.

I'd thought I\u00b4d share my findings with some pictures (below) to maybe help anyone out who's looking for an L-bracket for the SL2. The options I\u00b4ve tried are: Kirk ULB-1 3 Legged Thing Ellie Markins PV 100 & LV 170 For me personally I decided that the Markins is the best fit. It is also the lightest and generally has the smallest footprint thanks to the fact that it is possible to have the bracket part adjusted for a snug fit to the side of the camera. Obviously one cannot access any of the ports with the bracket mounted like that, but I don't usually need to. Obviously the Markins is also easily adjusted to extend the bracket part so that the ports are accessible. The Kirk comes in second for me, what I don't like about it on the SL2 is that the bottom main screw for the tripod socket is only adjustable \"sideways\" and the preset positions are not a good fit for the SL2\u00b4s tripod screw that is relatively far towards the back of the camera. Also the bracket part is not adjustable in distance to the body. However, with it mounted it is possible to still easily open the bottom port flap to access the USB-C port for example for charging. The 3 Legged Thing gave me a \"gimmicky\" impression. It felt a bit wobbly, probably because of the gap in the bracket part (that obviously also has advantages for cable management, I don't need this though). It also comes fairly close to the strap lugs and could cause issues when using a strap. Hope this helps anyone looking for an L-Bracket for their SL2. On a side note, I'm not a big fan of the RRS way of designing brackets for the SL range. They make an already large camera even larger and are also heavier than the other options.

I have read some conflicting advice regarding use of non Leica adapters and focus magnification and peaking. Is a Leica adapter necessary to obtain focus magnification and peaking or does it provide some additional flexibility that a Metabones adapter, for example, does not? Peaking is the same regardless of adapter. Without the M Adapter L, however, focus assist magnification has to be controlled using the four way controller rather than the L or R dial, which IMO really gets in the way of smooth operation since you also need the four way controller to position the magnified area (particularly when working tabletop and the camera on a tripod). If, like me, your primary use of the CL body is going to be exclusively with M and R mount lenses, rather than native lenses, the cost of the Leica M Adapter L requires no thought: fit it to the camera and leave it there forever. That's what I've done. I stack my R Adapter M on top of it when I go to use R lenses, otherwise it *is* my CL's native lens mount. You get the ergonomic improvement for focus assist magnification AND automated lens code detection AND any lens profile you choose to use is properly embedded into the metadata for best imaging. As a single, one time purchase, for me it's a maximum value for the money win.

What seemed like an AF issue with the lens and 2X the first time around looked more like an OIS problem today. The almost-but-not-quite focused look I got previously and again on some shots today appeared to occur on shots when I composed and shot quickly rather than giving OIS a couple of seconds to stabilize the image. Activating the shutter too quickly resulted in an OOF-like halo on some shots, and that's in addition to lack of acuity imparted by the teleconverter. Its optics are something like one might find on a 2X made by a third-party manufacturer in the 1980's. No such OIS issue was noted when the 1.4X TC was used. The combination's AF is fairly reliable. The TC's optics seem okay-ish, but not as good as the 1.4X offerings from other major manufacturers. The main limitations of the lens/1.4X combo are that it gives only a roughly 400mm AOV on the CL, and that it's soundly outperformed by the better R telephotos. Strangely, both Lumix lens/TC combinations yield a darker viewfinder than other long glass I've used on the CL. It's reflected in shutter speeds as well when the lens and 2X are combined, anecdotally around two thirds to a full stop slower at f/8 than the Sigma 100-400+TC at f/9. The Lumix 2X has been retired to paperweight status. I'd love to see Sigma build a lightweight (diffractive optics, maybe?) 400-500mm prime to a quality level rather than to a price point.

Years ago I bought a Hoodman Loupe when I was shooting a Canon body. The Hoodman is intended to be and held over the rear screen, which was fixed in a vertical position at that time. This works OK if the camera is on a tripod. The loupe comes with a neck cord so it is easy to get to and simply drop when you are finished with it.. However, I never really used it although the idea was good. It was just a little awkward. Now with the S1, it is another story. With the tilting screen the loupe sits there a lot better than before. However it is very simple to attach the loupe to the screen with a bit of fine elastic cord that goes under the screen when it is extended out. I also added a thin strip of plastic along the top edge of the loupe that extends down 1/8\" and just hooks over the edge of the screen. I just taped it on with electricians tape. This really helps to line it up perfectly and keep it in place. All this was done in 10 minutes. Now it works great. It is like the old 45 degree reflex finder available for the Hasselblad cameras that I loved. Although the viewfinder on the S!-R is great, the rear screen generates a larger image, The loupe allows you to see all the detail even in bright sunlight. With my quickly improvised attachment method, it is pretty secure, but if I was doing a lot of walking I would remove it so that it does not accidentally come off.

Now with a few hundred images under the camera's belt, it's time for an update. My work has involved landscape, studio close-up, and reportage, the latter including rather inclement weather. Camera The S1 has always worked when needed, although there were a couple of occasions when I had accidentally nudged the focusing area away from the point of interest which made me wonder why the camera either refused to auto-focus (e.g. trying to focus on an empty patch of sky) or the results were not as sharp as expected. AWB for most subjects has proved accurate enough including most mixed-lighting ('warm white' LED lights on the Christmas tree under other 'warm' fluorescent lighting needed some compromise in post!). However, especially for close-ups (see below) of items with a dominant colour, AWB tends to over-correct. Fortunately, alternative WB options are available, e.g. electronic flash, and outdoors shadows under 'north light, without having to include a ColourChecker in every shot (although I do so when possible). Outdoors 'walking around', battery drain is satisfactory, although I've adjusted the sleep time down from the factory preset. In the studio, where there tends to be more checking and thus the image is viewed for longer, an almost-fully-charged battery will last a few hours, so a spare is advisable. Image stablisation (IBIS and OIS) works well, although this does not mean I could be careless - it is still possible for images to be blurred owing to camera movement. So, perhaps regard IS as a safety net which extends the range of getting a usable result under challenging conditions. I am still deciding which Auto Review time suits various kinds of work (Auto Review displays the just-taken image for a set time). The first time I covered a live event (fortunately, informally for a friend), the Auto Review was set for 2s and meant I could not use see the scene to prepare for the next picture. I such cases, now, I set Auto Review to 0s. In normal use I keep it low, say 0.5s, which is sufficient for seeing whether the image is generally OK for, say, exposure and framing. Lens The 24-105 has proved very versatile, with admirable sharpness at all apertures. At the widest end of the zoom there is still some residual barrel distortion noticeable on the RAW files, easily corrected in post. In the studio, close-ups at about 1:3 to 1:4 magnification (which is not not really 'macro' for the purist, only for marketing) and where possible at the longest focal length, do show a slight softness in corners compared the centre, even when the lens is stopped down, but still very usable. I suspect this is curvature of field rather than a specific combination of aberrations (although specular highlights do show the latter if you look closely); this would seem to rule out any critical copying work for flat subjects, though I have yet to do any specific tests. Flash On camera, I've been using the Metz 64-AF1, so far in TTL mode, with satisfactory results. The flash adjusts its internal reflector according to the zoom setting as well as the output according to the f-value, so the software links are working as they should; this still leaves overall exposure compensation to be used if required, but essentially the flash is 'fit-and-forget'. In the studio I sync with a 3mm co-ax cable as both the camera and lights are in fixed positions relative to each other and the subject. Using the co-ax socket means that any shutter speed is available, including those beyond the highest allowed if a full frame is to be exposed (1/250s or 1/320s, depending on the flash). Overall As you can probably tell, I'm more than satisfied with the camera. Unsurprisingly, the images do not have the same (largely undefinable) 'look' as those from the M but this does not mean they are unusable - there have been no adverse from agencies through whom I try to sell.

Nowadays in underwater photography we use slave strobes (what was available some years ago as well for land photography) Slave strobes basically means that the strobe get triggered by the camera strobe and has a cell measuring the light bouncing back and adjusting acordingly the time of the strobe's flash. This sounds as a dumb, unreliable solution, but i can guarantee that this works surprisingle very well as the cameras TTL will correct exposure. But this is another story.... However, the common solution for close up macro photography is a ringe strobe as LeicaGuy already suggested. As Leica has no and TTL would not work with any other brand than LEICA there are only two solutions for a ring strobe a) buy the smallest outer diameter ring strobe available and drive it manually, they cam cost from 50$ up to 450 for the Metz ring strobe b) use one of this ring strobe adaptors who use the existing strobe and this would permit to use TTL if you use a LEICA strobe the one linked above is too wide but there are some other products with a smaller diameter. This would be also a nice and not too complicated project to engineer it for a Leica Strobe using a 3D printer Chris P.S. On page one of this tread you can see: a) the snake in the ceramic baking dish and some others on their natural ambient b) my ring light what is too wide diameter and will touch the floor and it's also not strong enough to be the only source of light Excluding very strong video lights, there is no replacement for a strobe as it's light output is much higher than a allways on light If you wonder why i use this McGyver solutions; 98% of my actual life i live either on the Island of Sardinia or in Costa Rica where photo shops are very rare and the existing ones sell only mainstream stuff. So i must buy my things either ordering them online and wait for days/weeks or buy it while i'm back in my hometown in Zurich. I dream of living in NYC where i just can walk over to Adorama or B&H ona buy whatever i need, but honestly, that would be my financial ruin...

 them wherever i want to have them, here is a similar setup as the one i use--img--  while writing this i realized that i could try to attach the q2 to the whole strobe stup and use them instead of my metz. nowadays in underwater photography we use slave strobes (what was available some years ago as well for land photography) slave strobes basically means that the strobe get triggered by the camera strobe and has a cell measuring the light bouncing back and adjusting acordingly the time of the strobe's flash. this sounds as a dumb, unreliable solution, but i can guarantee that this works surprisingle very well as the cameras ttl will correct exposure. but this is another story.... however, the common solution for close up macro photography is a ringe strobe as leicaguy already suggested. as leica has no and ttl would not work with any other brand than leica there are only two solutions for a ring strobe a) buy the smallest outer diameter ring strobe available and drive it manually, they cam cost from 50$ up to 450 for the metz ring strobe b) use one of this ring strobe adaptors who use the existing strobe and this would permit to use ttl if you use a leica strobe the one linked above is too wide but there are some other products with a smaller diameter. this would be also a nice and not too complicated project to engineer it for a leica strobe using a 3d printer chris p.s. on page one of this tread you can see: a) the snake in the ceramic baking dish and some others on their natural ambient b) my ring light what is too wide diameter and will touch the floor and it's also not strong enough to be the only source of light excluding very strong video lights, there is no replacement for a strobe as it's light output is much higher than a allways on light if you wonder why i use this mcgyver solutions; 98% of my actual life i live either on the island of sardinia or in costa rica where photo shops are very rare and the existing ones sell only mainstream stuff. so i must buy my things either ordering them online and wait for days/weeks or buy it while i'm back in my hometown in zurich. i dream of living in nyc where i just can walk over to adorama or b&h ona buy whatever i need, but honestly, that would be my financial ruin... so often i need to invent mcgyver solutions to be able to take a photo for what i cannot wait for days till i receive the needed goods. edited april 12, 2020 by photocruiser", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 52786, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 439486, "autor": "PhotoCruiser", "date": 1587803160000, "content": " On a tiny creature (half of toothbrush head) the ELP52 and the lens in macr position it looks like this and the heavy crop show the very good quality original phot, no resizing, just ligher depths, shot @ f/16 - 1/640 - iso100--img--  original photo as above but cropped --img--  Edited April 25, 2020 by PhotoCruiser", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/303743-macroclose-up-filters-for-the-q2/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-3960587", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": " on a tiny creature (half of toothbrush head) the elp52 and the lens in macr -----> position !!!

This is their 4th monochrome camera over the last 8 years, it is especially interesting as it is the first non-rangefinder camera with a black and white sensor. I think it\u2019s worth starting with a little history of monochrome cameras. Back in the early days of digital capture - Kodak ruled the world with cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars, In 1991 they they introduced the DCS 100 DM3 with a 1.3mp monochrome sensor; this was based on the Nikon F3 camera, and it had a separate DSU (Digital Storage Unit) which went over the photographer\u2019s shoulder (and was extremely heavy). It cost around $25,000. There is a fascinating article about it at Nikonweb (see references at the end of this article). In those days the demosaicing process was not as good as it is now, and that camera produced 2 or 3 times the definition of the normal colour version. Combined sales of the colour and monochrome version was apparently 987 cameras. In 2001 they produced a 6mp black and white sensor behemoth based on the Nikon F5. The Kodak DCS 760M. By now there was competition from Nikon with the D1 and D1x and the price was a slightly more manageable $8000. There is a very good write up of this camera by Pete Myers on Luminous Landscape . Sadly Kodak completely failed to capitalise on their head start in digital imaging, and especially the concept of a monochrome camera. Despite producing the first full frame dSLR in 2002, by 2005 they were out of the professional camera market altogether, the last camera being the DCS Pro SLR/n in 2004 (I had one, it was a fine camera, if a little quirky! But they never shipped the monochrome version). Leica had great success with their M8 and then full frame M9 digital cameras and the idea of making a monochrome version of the M9 seemed a bold and interesting move. I had a test camera in April 2012, and was lucky enough to be at an exciting launch of the M9 Monochrom in November 2012 in Berlin. I still have and use my own M9 Monochrom, it was, and still is a great camera. The 24mp M246 Monochrom was announced on April 30th 2015. The M10-Monochrom on January 17th 2020 with a new 40mp sensor, and now, less than a year later we have the Q2 Monochrom with a 47mp sensor derived from that in the Q2 (and SL2). I only had the Q2 Mono for around 3 weeks for testing last August, Covid 19 meant that I couldn\u2019t do any trips with the camera, but I took the time to look carefully at its performance in comparison with SL2 (which has essentially the same sensor but with a Colour Filter Array). As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my responsibility is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical. I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not told what to write, and although I do show the articles to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. Why a Monochrome Camera? Technical reasons With a colour digital camera the sensor itself can only detect the intensity of light, but it has a colour filter array to allow it to create colour images. The process of converting the image to colour is called demosaicing - This calculates the colour for each pixel based on the colour filter, and the results from the surrounding pixels in groups of 4. The colour filter array reduces the amount of light reaching the pixels by around 1 stop, and the demosaicing process has an effect on the resolution because of the combining of information. With a Monochrome camera, you don\u2019t need the colour filter array, This means that each pixel gets the maximum amount of light thus improving the high ISO characteristics of the camera and the dynamic range. As there is no demosaicing process there is no loss of resolution - each pixel is represented directly in the final image. Of course, there are also downsides: Many of us have become used to converting colour files to monochrome using the channel mixer in our processing software. This, in effect, allows us to apply filters to our images after the event. With a monochrome camera, if you want a red filter, you need to put it on the lens rather than relying on your computer. Another issue is that, despite the higher dynamic range, it\u2019s more important to ensure that you don\u2019t overexpose bright areas. With a colour camera you can usually extract some detail from one of the other colour channels, with a monochrome camera, once it\u2019s blown out there is nothing to recover! This is slightly exacerbated by the higher base ISO of the sensor (usually twice that of an equivalent colour sensor). Photographic reasons Demosaicing techniques have improved over the years, and although there is an obvious improvement in resolution without a colour filter array, it\u2019s not quite as sensational as it was when the M9 Monochrome appeared in 2012. Added to which 47mp resolution should be quite enough for most uses. But having spent a lot of time with all of the Leica Monochrom cameras over the years I\u2019ve come to think that the most important reason for shooting with one is how it changes one\u2019s approach as a photographer. For me at least it makes me think much more about the structure and composition of an image. With the previous M Monochrom cameras, shooting normally with the rangefinder you did still see the subject in colour, the Q2 Mono takes this a step further in that you see the motif in black and white through the viewfinder. You start to think in black and white! Body and Design Leica\u2019s design department have gone from strength to strength making increasingly beautiful and functional cameras, the Q2 Monochrom is no exception, and with its grey and white markings it is indeed handsome. From a functional and operational point of view, with the exception of the obvious lack of White Balance controls, the grey lettering and the changed ISO values, the Monochrom is identical to the standard Q2. The Lens The lens is the same as the Q and Q2: If it isn\u2019t broke - don\u2019t fix it! It\u2019s a wonderful lens, compact and very sharp, it does soften up a bit at the corners, especially at wide aperture, but most of the frame is pin sharp right from f1.7. A simple twist of the lens engages Macro Mode and changes the distance gauge in the most delightful way. Close focus is 30cm in normal and 17cm in Macro mode. Controls The aperture ring is on the lens with the shutter speed on the top plate (just like the Leica M cameras). This makes the camera seem very familiar, Both the Aperture and shutter speed dials have an A position. A on both = Program Mode A on shutter dial = Aperture Priority A on Aperture dial = Shutter Priority A on neither = Manual exposure 3 function buttons can be assigned as needed, and the now familiar Leica rear buttons with Play, Function and Menu are all present. Personally, I would have liked to see a joy stick like the SL and SL2. The Digital Zoom Digital zoom is something of a dirty word in the photography world, probably from the days when small megapixel cameras offered gravelly shots at apparently extended focal length. The Q2 Monochrom is a bit different because the base resolution is so high, and because the implementation is so good, and so consistent with the Leica rangefinder. Implementation of crop mode or digital zoom in other cameras usually involves the EVF / LCD zooming in, with the Q2 Mono, as with the Q2, you can change between 4 focal lengths using the zoom / Lock-button. Choosing a longer focal length simply puts framelines in the display showing what you are going to get. If you shoot JPG files then that is exactly what you do get. If you shoot DNG then the image is not actually cropped. However, if you use Lightroom or Lightroom Classic, then the DNG file appears in cropped form (you can use the crop tool to change or remove the cropping in post processing). The four digital zoom modes are: 28mm 8368 x 5584 47mp . effective aperture f1.7 35mm 6704 x 4472 30mp . effective aperture f2 50mm 4688 x 3128 14.6mp effective aperture f2.8 75mm 3136 x 2096 6.6mp . effective aperture f4.6 \u201cEffective aperture\u201d refers to the depth of field effect\u201d I think this is a great feature, and with the increased resolution of the Q2 Mono it makes the 50mm crop zone perfectly usable and the 75mm okay at a pinch (especially as the lens is so sharp). Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually turn the lens into a different focal length, but the aspect ratio of the resulting image is exactly the same. What you lose is the depth of field relating to the cropped focal length. Basically this will always be the same as that of a 28mm f1.7, so it\u2019s harder to use bokeh to isolate the subject. Due to the big demand for review cameras I don\u2019t have a camera in front of me, but if you want more details then please refer to my original review of the colour Q2. Image comparisons During the test period I didn\u2019t have either an M10 Monochrom, or a Q2, both of which would have made interesting resolution comparisons. However, my old friend and partner in crime Sean Reid is doing a very detailed comparison of these three cameras. More about that later. I thought it was interesting to compare the Q2 Monochrom to three of Leica\u2019s recent high resolution colour cameras, the M10, the M10-R and the SL. Of course the lens used is an issue in that one can\u2019t do a real oranges and oranges comparison. In this case I\u2019ve used the 28 Summilux Asph M for the M10 and M10-r and the SL 24-90 at 28mm on the SL2. Images were all shot as DNG and the colour images were converted to black and white in Adobe Lightroom. For all these tests the camera was set on a sturdy tripod with a 2 second shutter delay. To try and limit focus variances shots were all taken at f5.6. The shutter speed was allowed to vary to ensure that the images were as consistently exposed as possible. Here is a full example of the test scene: --img--  Resolution Of course I\u2019ve shot hundreds of images, but in terms of the resolution I thought it was more sensible to do a resolution test at 200 ISO. I\u2019ve used the centre of the frame (roughly) for the comparison. The M10 and M10-R Images have been upsized in photoshop so that it they are the same size as those from the other two cameras. --img--  In addition to this resolution comparison I did a series of shots of a hedge at about 10 metres at different apertures. Sadly there was some movement in the hedge, and on some of the shots there are obvious signs of blurring. I no longer have the Q2 Mono, so I can\u2019t redo them, but although most of each frame is very sharp, it isn\u2019t all perfect and I think that posting examples might be misleading, added to which they are very boring! However what I found was that the Q2 Monochrome shots had an obvious advantage in the centre at all apertures, with a real magical presence to the files, at f1.7 and f2.8 the Q2 Mono was slightly softer at the corners than either the SL2 or the M10-R. Stopped down a little more the corners were about even, but even at f8 the Q2 Mono still showed an obvious advantage in terms of presence and detail. High ISO Performance Base ISO on the Q2 Monochrom is 200, there is also a pull option of ISO 1oo. For this test I did comparisons at the following ISO values 200 ISO 800 ISO 1600 ISO 3200 ISO 6400 ISO 12,500 ISO 25,000 ISO 50,000 ISO 100,000 ISO (Q2 Monochrome only) I loaded the groups of 4 DNG files directly into photoshop, magnified them to 100% and then taken a screen shot and labelled it. --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  Looking at these comparisons it\u2019s very clear that the Q2 Monochrome has considerable advantage over the other 3 cameras, especially as the ISO value increases and at higher ISO values it\u2019s probably about 1.1/2 stops better. Together with the higher resolution this is obviously going to be a real advantage shooting in very low light. It\u2019s quite remarkable how much detail there is, even in the 100,000 ISO shot, even the banding is very well controlled. An impressive performance. Conclusion Sadly, because of Covid restrictions and the relatively short time I had the camera I didn\u2019t manage do any street photography, and precious little portrait photography either. Hopefully with the results of the Pfizer vaccination test yesterday we will all be on the move again before too long! The Q cameras have been a real success story for Leica and a perfect example of their talent for finding a photographic niche and making it their own. The only real competitor has been the Sony RX1R II with a 35 mm lens, but Sony have not updated this since 2016 (which, with their rapid product cycles sounds like they\u2019ve abandoned it). I have to admit to starting off feeling that in this day of 48mp resolution there wasn\u2019t really a need for a monochrome version of the Q2, but actually I have been quite captivated. The superb high ISO performance is a real bonus shooting in low light and gives one extra flexibility in normal light. The resolution might not be needed, but the look of the files is so wonderfully clean and \u2018present\u2019. I think that this camera is going to be a real hit with street and travel photographers, indeed, anyone who shoots primarily in black and white.

but they never shipped the monochrome version). leica had great success with their m8 and then full frame m9 digital cameras and the idea of making a monochrome version of the m9 seemed a bold and interesting move. i had a test camera in april 2012, and was lucky enough to be at an exciting launch of the m9 monochrom in november 2012 in berlin. i still have and use my own m9 monochrom, it was, and still is a great camera. the 24mp m246 monochrom was announced on april 30th 2015. the m10-monochrom on january 17th 2020 with a new 40mp sensor, and now, less than a year later we have the q2 monochrom with a 47mp sensor derived from that in the q2 (and sl2). i only had the q2 mono for around 3 weeks for testing last august, covid 19 meant that i couldn\u2019t do any trips with the camera, but i took the time to look carefully at its performance in comparison with sl2 (which has essentially the same sensor but with a colour filter array). as usual i should emphasise that my job with leica is as a camera tester, and my responsibility is to report problems to leica (which i certainly do!). on the other hand i would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical. i don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). i\u2019m not told what to write, and although i do show the articles to leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. why a monochrome camera? technical reasons with a colour digital camera the sensor itself can only detect the intensity of light, but it has a colour filter array to allow it to create colour images. the process of converting the image to colour is called demosaicing - this calculates the colour for each pixel based on the colour filter, and the results from the surrounding pixels in groups of 4. the colour filter array reduces the amount of light reaching the pixels by around 1 stop, and the demosaicing process has an effect on the resolution because of the combining of information. with a monochrome camera, you don\u2019t need the colour filter array, this means that each pixel gets the maximum amount of light thus improving the high iso characteristics of the camera and the dynamic range. as there is no demosaicing process there is no loss of resolution - each pixel is represented directly in the final image. of course, there are also downsides: many of us have become used to converting colour files to monochrome using the channel mixer in our processing software. this, in effect, allows us to apply filters to our images after the event. with a monochrome camera, if you want a red filter, you need to put it on the lens rather than relying on your computer. another issue is that, despite the higher dynamic range, it\u2019s more important to ensure that you don\u2019t overexpose bright areas. with a colour camera you can usually extract some detail from one of the other colour channels, with a monochrome camera, once it\u2019s blown out there is nothing to recover! this is slightly exacerbated by the higher base iso of the sensor (usually twice that of an equivalent colour sensor). photographic reasons demosaicing techniques have improved over the years, and although there is an obvious improvement in resolution without a colour filter array, it\u2019s not quite as sensational as it was when the m9 monochrome appeared in 2012. added to which 47mp resolution should be quite enough for most uses. but having spent a lot of time with all of the leica monochrom cameras over the years i\u2019ve come to think that the most important reason for shooting with one is how it changes one\u2019s approach as a photographer. for me at least it makes me think much more about the structure and composition of an image. with the previous m monochrom cameras, shooting normally with the rangefinder you did still see the subject in colour, the q2 mono takes this a step further in that you see the motif in black and white through the viewfinder. you start to think in black and white! body and design leica\u2019s design department have gone from strength to strength making increasingly beautiful and functional cameras, the q2 monochrom is no exception, and with its grey and white markings it is indeed handsome. from a functional and operational point of view, with the exception of the obvious lack of white balance controls, the grey lettering and the changed iso values, the monochrom is identical to the standard q2. the lens the lens is the same as the q and q2: if it isn\u2019t broke - don\u2019t fix it! it\u2019s a wonderful lens, compact and very sharp, it does soften up a bit at the corners, especially at wide aperture, but most of the frame is pin sharp right from f1.7. a simple twist of the lens engages macro mode and changes the distance gauge in the most delightful way. close focus is 30cm in normal and 17cm in macro mode. controls the aperture ring is on the lens with the shutter speed on the top plate (just like the leica m cameras). this makes the camera seem very familiar, both the aperture and shutter speed dials have an a -----> position !!! . a on both = program mode a on shutter dial = aperture priority a on aperture dial = shutter priority a on neither = manual exposure 3 function buttons can be assigned as needed, and the now familiar leica rear buttons with play, function and menu are all present. personally, i would have liked to see a joy stick like the sl and sl2. the digital zoom digital zoom is something of a dirty word in the photography world, probably from the days when small megapixel cameras offered gravelly shots at apparently extended focal length. the q2 monochrom is a bit different because the base resolution is so high, and because the implementation is so good, and so consistent with the leica rangefinder. implementation of crop mode or digital zoom in other cameras usually involves the evf / lcd zooming in, with the q2 mono, as with the q2, you can change between 4 focal lengths using the zoom / lock-button. choosing a longer focal length simply puts framelines in the display showing what you are going to get. if you shoot jpg files then that is exactly what you do get. if you shoot dng then the image is not actually cropped. however, if you use lightroom or lightroom classic, then the dng file appears in cropped form (you can use the crop tool to change or remove the cropping in post processing). the four digital zoom modes are: 28mm 8368 x 5584 47mp . effective aperture f1.7 35mm 6704 x 4472 30mp . effective aperture f2 50mm 4688 x 3128 14.6mp effective aperture f2.8 75mm 3136 x 2096 6.6mp . effective aperture f4.6 \u201ceffective aperture\u201d refers to the depth of field effect\u201d i think this is a great feature, and with the increased resolution of the q2 mono it makes the 50mm crop zone perfectly usable and the 75mm okay at a pinch (especially as the lens is so sharp). of course, it doesn\u2019t actually turn the lens into a different focal length, but the aspect ratio of the resulting image is exactly the same. what you lose is the depth of field relating to the cropped focal length. basically this will always be the same as that of a 28mm f1.7, so it\u2019s harder to use bokeh to isolate the subject. due to the big demand for review cameras i don\u2019t have a camera in front of me, but if you want more details then please refer to my original review of the colour q2. image comparisons during the test period i didn\u2019t have either an m10 monochrom, or a q2, both of which would have made interesting resolution comparisons. however, my old friend and partner in crime sean reid is doing a very detailed comparison of these three cameras. more about that later. i thought it was interesting to compare the q2 monochrom to three of leica\u2019s recent high resolution colour cameras, the m10, the m10-r and the sl. of course the lens used is an issue in that one can\u2019t do a real oranges and oranges comparison. in this case i\u2019ve used the 28 summilux asph m for the m10 and m10-r and the sl 24-90 at 28mm on the sl2. images were all shot as dng and the colour images were converted to black and white in adobe lightroom. for all these tests the camera was set on a sturdy tripod with a 2 second shutter delay. to try and limit focus variances shots were all taken at f5.6. the shutter speed was allowed to vary to ensure that the images were as consistently exposed as possible. here is a full example of the test scene: --img--  resolution of course i\u2019ve shot hundreds of images, but in terms of the resolution i thought it was more sensible to do a resolution test at 200 iso. i\u2019ve used the centre of the frame (roughly) for the comparison. the m10 and m10-r images have been upsized in photoshop so that it they are the same size as those from the other two cameras. --img--  in addition to this resolution comparison i did a series of shots of a hedge at about 10 metres at different apertures. sadly there was some movement in the hedge, and on some of the shots there are obvious signs of blurring. i no longer have the q2 mono, so i can\u2019t redo them, but although most of each frame is very sharp, it isn\u2019t all perfect and i think that posting examples might be misleading, added to which they are very boring! however what i found was that the q2 monochrome shots had an obvious advantage in the centre at all apertures, with a real magical presence to the files, at f1.7 and f2.8 the q2 mono was slightly softer at the corners than either the sl2 or the m10-r. stopped down a little more the corners were about even, but even at f8 the q2 mono still showed an obvious advantage in terms of presence and detail. high iso performance base iso on the q2 monochrom is 200, there is also a pull option of iso 1oo. for this test i did comparisons at the following iso values 200 iso 800 iso 1600 iso 3200 iso 6400 iso 12,500 iso 25,000 iso 50,000 iso 100,000 iso (q2 monochrome only) i loaded the groups of 4 dng files directly into photoshop, magnified them to 100% and then taken a screen shot and labelled it. --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  looking at these comparisons it\u2019s very clear that the q2 monochrome has considerable advantage over the other 3 cameras, especially as the iso value increases and at higher iso values it\u2019s probably about 1.1/2 stops better. together with the higher resolution this is obviously going to be a real advantage shooting in very low light. it\u2019s quite remarkable how much detail there is, even in the 100,000 iso shot, even the banding is very well controlled. an impressive performance. conclusion sadly, because of covid restrictions and the relatively short time i had the camera i didn\u2019t manage do any street photography, and precious little portrait photography either. hopefully with the results of the pfizer vaccination test yesterday we will all be on the move again before too long!
