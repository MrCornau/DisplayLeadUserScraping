Hi There Perhaps I wasn't clear about this - there wasn't a problem with the meter, and actually another shot stopped down metered the boat pretty accurately. The problem was that I'd asked the camera to shoot wide open on Aperture priority at f1.4 in bright sunlight - the camera quite rightly maxed the shutter out at 1/4,000 sec - it could do no more! Certainly, there was no way it could possibly under-expose. On the other hand I agree that given a possible exposure the camera is prone to under-expose (both the M10 and M10-R) and I'm pretty sure this is to avoid blown highlights. For this impossible lighting situation (as per OP) the lower base ISO makes this a bit easier, and the fact that the highlights don't roll off so fast is the other component.

Here are some further explanations: I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t spelt out what I\u2019m getting at on this post. The point is that you can shoot the M10-R in brighter light conditions than the M10, M or M9. Without using ND filters. This wouldn\u2019t matter to everyone, but I often want to shoot with the lens wide open in very bright high contrast situations (generally people rather than boats!). The base ISO of the M10-R already gives you 1 stop advantage (100 vs M10\u2019s 200). In addition to this you can recover a lot more information than you can with the previous M cameras.

But an otherwise ideal starting point for some post processing you'd think, except personal observations are put to one side because the camera has been bought to make photography better, not to be overridden with subjective judgements. So what are we really seeing, a fashion trend for photos without white in them, or people losing their ability to make their own judgements? I have nothing against grey, and it could be a statement about the times we live in, except it isn't is it? Most of the M10M image thread content tells the story of not upsetting the apple cart, this is how the camera makes the image so dammit it must be right. It's not new, the M9M image thread exhibited similar grey content. It's hard to imagine anybody should want less objective judgement because many decisions can be made from it, but perhaps encouraging more subjective judgement is a tandem job? I'm sorry - I misunderstood your first sentence - I thought you though I was attacking you! I remember when I wrote the M9M review back in the mists of time, people thought that the files looked flat. I actually quite agree with your first point - the more dynamic range you have the more opportunity there is . . . but the more you have to do something. First thing I was taught in the darkroom (by my Dad) was that a black and white picture should have black and white in it! I certainly don't think there is a fashion trend for pictures with no white in them (or black come to that), although there are circumstances where grey images can work I agree the it's unusual. To be honest, I think you misunderstood my original intent (probably I didn't write it down very clearly). It wasn't actually about dynamic range at all, but more about an ugly rolloff between blown highlights which the M10r has fixed - anyway, water under the bridge. So, yes, I agree, encouraging subjective judgement is important, and as the dynamic range of cameras increases it's important to understand that that's an opportunity rather than an end result .. . . . if you don't want to do any post processing, then you're better off shooting jpg.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/312525-this-is-why-i-bought-an-m10r/page/11/?tab=comments#comment-4062698", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "on 10/12/2020 at 9:08 am, 250swb said: if you continue to make it a personal attack i think you are missing the entire point. look at the m10m, a camera that excels at capturing a vast range of tones, so well in fact that you should try looking through the m10m image thread and try and -----> spot !!!  the photos that still have some white in them (or even a normal range of mid-tones in them). in life you would squint at the bright sky full of brilliant clouds, in the photo the clouds are an off-white tone because the camera has subjugated them. but an otherwise ideal starting point for some post processing you'd think, except personal observations are put to one side because the camera has been bought to make photography better, not to be overridden with subjective judgements. so what are we really seeing, a fashion trend for photos without white in them, or people losing their ability to make their own judgements? i have nothing against grey, and it could be a statement about the times we live in, except it isn't is it? most of the m10m image thread content tells the story of not upsetting the apple cart, this is how the camera makes the image so dammit it must be right. it's not new, the m9m image thread exhibited similar grey content. it's hard to imagine anybody should want less objective judgement because many decisions can be made from it, but perhaps encouraging more subjective judgement is a tandem job? i'm sorry - i misunderstood your first sentence - i thought you though i was attacking you! i remember when i wrote the m9m review back in the mists of time, people thought that the files looked flat. i actually quite agree with your first point - the more dynamic range you have the more opportunity there is . . . but the more you have to do something. first thing i was taught in the darkroom (by my dad) was that a black and white picture should have black and white in it! i certainly don't think there is a fashion trend for pictures with no white in them (or black come to that), although there are circumstances where grey images can work i agree the it's unusual. to be honest, i think you misunderstood my original intent (probably i didn't write it down very clearly). it wasn't actually about dynamic range at all, but more about an ugly rolloff between blown highlights which the m10r has fixed - anyway, water under the bridge. so, yes, i agree, encouraging subjective judgement is important, and as the dynamic range of cameras increases it's important to understand that that's an opportunity rather than an end result .. . . . if you don't want to do any post processing, then you're better off shooting jpg.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 5345, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 344659, "autor": "Steve Ricoh", "date": 1594982400000, "content": "Some will disagree for sure, but the sweet spot for 35mm digital sensor is 24MP in my opinion.

Now my question to you is not which camera is Sony and which is Leica, but which one did you prefer ? https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31?usp=sharing Your pictures have produced some advanced thoughts. The setting is world class beautiful. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31 TECHNICAL COMMENT ON THE TEST: For each two pictures, one picture is usually more sharp than the other. Can not say which I like best. The sharper picture had more of a \"still life\" feel to it. The less sharp more of an atmospheric feel. Which I liked more depended on subject matter. I can not say that I saw the M10 24 meg smoothness verses the M10-R 40 meg light harshness though yet another version of this effect is illustrated in your pictures. Overall I liked the sharper one better because it catches that \"still life\" aesthetic. Yet the sharpness was somewhat of a smooth-sharpness, not with a irritating harsh edge, maybe due to lens choice. Increasingly I see this as important, that if the sensor has the highest level of megabytes, it will be \"sharp\" but it might also produce a pixelation type digital-harsh-edge harshness that is not exactly seen but felt, since that edge harshness is only slightly there out at the highest levels of resolution. The paragraph immediately above is the only explanation I can give for the M10's pictures being more satisfying (somehow less harsh) than the M10-R's. Yet with software the M10-R's rendition might be smoothable to end this lightly irritating harshness and thus create the best still life's (see below Art Comment). So overall I would say that if a person is good with post production software the M10-R might be the better choice. Yet I dislike spending hours in post and prefer the adjustment be selectable in the camera. HIGHER MEG SENSOR HARSHNESS: In the interest of the intellectual study of the arts I will venture an explanation which might be torn down latter. Some will say this 40 meg harshness is just a matter of contrast technically but I would go further and say that it might be the sharp 40 line pairs (80 lines) MTF test-lines of the lens interacting with the inherent digital pixelation harshness of small pixel (40 meg based) digital sensor capture. Thus the 24 meg digital with big pixels and less resolution can not produce this harshness at the higher resolution 80 line mtf test point but the 40 meg can see this fine edge making it rough/harsh where the 24meg sensor misses this fine detail. If the camera software does not soften up this new increased detail a bit then you get a sort of micro edge harshness that 24 meg could not produce. Through your choice (not a mistake) of a less sharp and artistically rendering lens (Voitlander Nokton 35mm1.4), the lens helps make the picture work, softening the digital harshness effect. With a sharper Leica lens directing light to a sharper Leica 40 meg sensor, a harshness might be produced which irritates as seen by we ultra sensitive viewers, and as found in the previous M10 24meg vs M10-R 40meg pictures by we ultra-sensitives (not trolls). As in Formula One racing\u2026 the most moneyed race engineers hit the limits of the physics first and see problematic phenomena that create problems to be dealt with. Less moneyed race teams working with known technology do not see these problems. Thus the M10-R 40 meg plus the sharpest of Leica lenses may be producing this harsh line edge which makes M10's softer edge line edge more desirable. Fix it in post as they say (if that is fully possible). The M10 is definitely a standout camera in the history of digital cameras in both how it treats sharpness and color saturation. ART COMMENT: One of the many explanations for the \"still life\" effect is: as the eye looks around it sees something that looks real because of an extremely high level of detail, yet your mind also knows that \"it is not real it is a picture\". This dichotomy is intriguing, to vacillate between the emotional-mental sensation of real and unreal. Again, by using smallest F-stops and high meg sensors and sharpest lenses, placing the ultra high resolution in various places around the scene where the eye would not normally see so much detail, signals the mind that something otherworldly is going on. Again, the emotion is one of \"this is real but it is not real\" which is otherworldly giving an accompanying intrigue. So in Still Life you have at least two intrigues: 1- Picture representation verses reality and 2- The beyond human focus detail verses what your eye-mind is normally encountering in the real world. In the USA some call this aesthetic \"American Realism\" as the ultra high detail of a painter's Still Life \"table top subject\" is applied to \"a scene much larger than a table top\". In the picture your eye sees more detail than it would ever see in real life. All around the frame picture elements \"pop\" into life as their detail is noticed. BACK TO CAMERAS: The ability of the 40 meg sensor to create this Still Life ultra sharpness effect, means I would favor the sharper higher meg picture if the harshness can be lessoned by some de-sharpening. Also maybe software can soften the 40 meg picture down to the more atmospheric softer focus effect of the 24 meg? Fixing in post production software to me frequently creates a picture that looks way too extreme, artificial, and childish like advertising shock techniques so I would rather the camera produce a satisfying rendition in a more eye-natural manner. I do not want to spend hours playing with software sliders that mainly result in an unrealistic looking \"mechanical\" picture. Do I have the time or interest in trying to make the two cameras match one another in post... probably not. I will leave this for people like the great Overgaard. Still can he make one camera perform like two cameras... it is too much to ask. If not or with a little changing of the picture in post... two cameras sit out there on the market with unique and justifiable existences. The artsy 24 meg soft sharpness camera M10 and the 40 meg M10-R with an edge hardness that can likely be lessoned in software to produce a fascinating Still Life ultra high resolution rendition. One website I read comments that the M10-R's 40 megs helps see the original rendition of older Leica lenses (Steve Huff's site). To me this is a holy grail for camera bodies - to bring out the old Leica lens characteristics. I find it odd that people want their lenses \"corrected\" by software. Clearly they have missed the concept of \"art\" as a \"partially real and part modified\" representation of reality. IF I MADE DECISIONS FOR THE LEICA COMPANY: I would NOT only let the time and attention of the marketplace decide the popularity of my camera and aesthetic. I would also produce download instructions for manually entered adjustments for the different aesthetics and also produce template files where possible. Why let 3rd parties decide your economic survival? Why leave the user in the dark without the knowledge to fully use the camera? Yet best would be a checkbox in the camera's menu software that would produce the 24meg softer aesthetic or the 40 meg sharper still life aesthetic. Thanks for the picture test Steve... you got me thinking.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/314500-24meg-verses-40meg-aesthetic/page/9/?tab=comments#comment-4070680", "origin":

the m10p , it was actually easier to focus with the rf than with the focus peaking on the sony, even if the sony is nice. the metering on the a7siii outperforms the m10p almost every time, even though i used the m10p in live mode to avoid -----> spot !!!  metering. i did the blind test to myself, and to be honest i could not always guess which camera was which. but almost every time i shocked myself and preferred the sony to the leica. of course, shooting wise, the sony was still disgusting, and the leica was a total pleasure. but what i remember from this is that 12mp vs 24mp produces no aesthetics difference (since this is what this thread is about). besides that, of course i prefer my leica, but if one day i go out to shoot video with my sony, i know that i could bring my 35 mil with me and still get photos as well. let me know if you have any interrogation on the way i took the photos, settings, etc.... now my question to you is not which camera is sony and which is leica, but which one did you prefer ? https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wclybcwqb_i2nw6dhf8-4vhfutxcpf31?usp=sharing your pictures have produced some advanced thoughts. the setting is world class beautiful. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wclybcwqb_i2nw6dhf8-4vhfutxcpf31 technical comment on the test: for each two pictures, one picture is usually more sharp than the other. can not say which i like best. the sharper picture had more of a \"still life\" feel to it. the less sharp more of an atmospheric feel. which i liked more depended on subject matter. i can not say that i saw the m10 24 meg smoothness verses the m10-r 40 meg light harshness though yet another version of this effect is illustrated in your pictures. overall i liked the sharper one better because it catches that \"still life\" aesthetic. yet the sharpness was somewhat of a smooth-sharpness, not with a irritating harsh edge, maybe due to lens choice. increasingly i see this as important, that if the sensor has the highest level of megabytes, it will be \"sharp\" but it might also produce a pixelation type digital-harsh-edge harshness that is not exactly seen but felt, since that edge harshness is only slightly there out at the highest levels of resolution. the paragraph immediately above is the only explanation i can give for the m10's pictures being more satisfying (somehow less harsh) than the m10-r's. yet with software the m10-r's rendition might be smoothable to end this lightly irritating harshness and thus create the best still life's (see below art comment). so overall i would say that if a person is good with post production software the m10-r might be the better choice. yet i dislike spending hours in post and prefer the adjustment be selectable in the camera. higher meg sensor harshness: in the interest of the intellectual study of the arts i will venture an explanation which might be torn down latter. some will say this 40 meg harshness is just a matter of contrast technically but i would go further and say that it might be the sharp 40 line pairs (80 lines) mtf test-lines of the lens interacting with the inherent digital pixelation harshness of small pixel (40 meg based) digital sensor capture. thus the 24 meg digital with big pixels and less resolution can not produce this harshness at the higher resolution 80 line mtf test point but the 40 meg can see this fine edge making it rough/harsh where the 24meg sensor misses this fine detail. if the camera software does not soften up this new increased detail a bit then you get a sort of micro edge harshness that 24 meg could not produce. through your choice (not a mistake) of a less sharp and artistically rendering lens (voitlander nokton 35mm1.4), the lens helps make the picture work, softening the digital harshness effect. with a sharper leica lens directing light to a sharper leica 40 meg sensor, a harshness might be produced which irritates as seen by we ultra sensitive viewers, and as found in the previous m10 24meg vs m10-r 40meg pictures by we ultra-sensitives (not trolls). as in formula one racing\u2026 the most moneyed race engineers hit the limits of the physics first and see problematic phenomena that create problems to be dealt with. less moneyed race teams working with known technology do not see these problems. thus the m10-r 40 meg plus the sharpest of leica lenses may be producing this harsh line edge which makes m10's softer edge line edge more desirable. fix it in post as they say (if that is fully possible). the m10 is definitely a standout camera in the history of digital cameras in both how it treats sharpness and color saturation. art comment: one of the many explanations for the \"still life\" effect is: as the eye looks around it sees something that looks real because of an extremely high level of detail, yet your mind also knows that \"it is not real it is a picture\". this dichotomy is intriguing, to vacillate between the emotional-mental sensation of real and unreal. again, by using smallest f-stops and high meg sensors and sharpest lenses, placing the ultra high resolution in various places around the scene where the eye would not normally see so much detail, signals the mind that something otherworldly is going on. again, the emotion is one of \"this is real but it is not real\" which is otherworldly giving an

Image #1: B -Rationale: I prefer softer transition look towards the right corner Image #2: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal. Besides the warmer colours from the top LHS, I am assuming the sun position had changed. Image #3: A -Rationale: I preferred the \u201chue\u201d of the green grass behind the soft toy Image #4: B -Rationale: I really didn\u2019t like image A corners. it looked like it had shade of \u201cpink\u201d Image #5: A -Rationale: Although I didn\u2019t like the colours on the corners, I actually preferred the highlights \u201cclipping\u201d in this image. Image B is technically better (highlights don\u2019t look clipped\u2026 has a more gently roll off) but my preference is still A Image #6: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #7: B -Rationale: I prefer the colours from the ocean \u2013 Sky compared to A -Additional Notes: Looking at the grass I can see what sections of the frame is in focus, so I won\u2019t focus on the dog and ball. Image #8: N/A -Rationale: I had a slight preference to A due to the skin tones, but it\u2019s difficult for me to make an assessment here, as the focus is slightly different. -Additional Notes: note that the image on A is focused on the eye, whilst B is slightly off Image #9: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #10: B -Rationale: The tiles had more detail on B than A (Corners) Image #11: B -Rationale: I prefer the warmer look in (B) than the colder look in (A) Image #12: B -Rationale: Prefer how the tree looks (shadow) compared to A. Additionally I like how the wall on the RHS look the \u201ccooler\u201d colour cast looks better compared to the slightly warmer tones. Image #13: A -Rationale: I prefer the warmer colours here (green, sky) Image #14: A -Rationale: I prefer the warmer colours here -Additional Notes: focus is slightly different (refer to the tap) Image #15: B -Rationale: Prefer the light on the grass in this scene, very close though. Image #16: N/A -Rationale: I preferred A but as the focus here is slightly different it\u2019s an \u201cN/A\u201d -Additional Notes: Focus is slightly different here Image #18: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #19: B -Rationale: Prefer the colour of the timber here Image #20: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal -Additional Notes: Focus is slightly different here Image #21: A -Rationale: Prefer the colour of the sky here, the other image is too cold Image #22: A -Rationale: Prefer the white couch here -Additional Notes: Focus is slightly different here Image #23: A -Rationale: Prefer the colours in the sky here Image #24:B -Rationale: The green on the plant looked weird in A My Conclusion/Self-reflection: I kind of expected these kinds of results, I have tried something similar with my camera gear in the past.

So two cameras different in time and construction and name but results are the same\u2026 please do not get mad at me if I do not pray to you\u2026 since I think your answer to me might disappoint. Pardon me as I discuss below: Issue 1: The above is hard to believe given the different sensor size of the cell phone and camera and the expected DOF differences of the source sensors. Maybe Photoshop is the limit here\u2026 I remember back when film could not differentiate from digital since the digital film scanners limited the film to looking like the digital cameras. This has been my question for years\u2026 are not the limits of digital capture and digital software making all things look the same? Would the people writing the software admit to this - no their marketing department would shut them up. Put slightly differently: I remember the talk of how film was no better than digital when in-fact the scanners being used were digital and limited the scanned film look to the digital scanner look. How stupid this seemed to be, allowing the scanning to limit the film quality perception and then blaming it on the film, and not blaming it on the digital scanner that could not pull all the detail out of the film. So is Photoshop and other digital software and camera color electronics, which must use similar routines and file structures, taking all files and forcing them into some file structure that makes the files all look the same? How would we as users know if this file quality dumbing down was happening or not? The marketing departments are unlikely to tell us. Issue 2: To argue with myself above, as a good intellect must do, as megapixels or film lines become higher and higher, there must be diminishing returns of improvements possible, and thus diminishing differentiation to be found, so at some level of technology all pictures should look the same, have we achieved that now? Put slightly differently: as the technology quality increases, at some level of megapixels, the quality is so high regardless of what type of equipment that produces it, that all pictures look the same. At this \"quality increase vanishing point\", when the high level of technology has effectively made all camera outputs the same, camera makers resort to deliberately changing the picture's characteristics so as to claim they have something unique, making an artificial change, creating a brand name associated aesthetic. In audio this is called \"house sound\" or \"company sound characteristic\" which is the unique brand associated sound characteristic that a speaker or piece of electronics gives to all music played through it. FINAL PERSPECTIVE: Well, maybe I do not want to know any of this\u2026 the god's of product differentiation are letting me down. This is what we get for chasing perfection rather than different artistically modified recordings of reality. By definition art is made when the look of a thing is reproduced yet somehow changed from normal. But the camera industry has chased technical perfection, not art, and there is no picture differentiation when technical perfection is achieved by all.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/314500-24meg-verses-40meg-aesthetic/page/11/?tab=comments#comment-4070966", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "58 minutes ago, tailwagger said: the original question was essentially around the effect of fewer versus more pixels on the 'aesthetic' of the shot... what ever that really means. i assume it to mean that some folks are displeased with the sooc result when the image is downsampled to be viewed on a screen, particularly when using a more high contrast modern optic. and so they jump to conclusions, assuming a single variable, more pixels in the midsts of hundreds of other unknowns, is clearly the why of things. while it's not surprising when laying out this sort of coin some folks seem to expect a flavor profile befitting a third michelin star produced at a mcdonald's pace, the sad reality is that to produce a truly tasty dish is generally more complicated than just point and shoot. the idea that sooc comparisons, as on offer here, is what one should be concerned with as opposed to the malleability the files provide on the way to a satisfying result is frankly perplexing to me. it may be expedient, but it's not particularly relevant. but okay, it's a snow day and this whole discussion is so amusing, that i'll bite. two minute experiment involving a two year old cell phone vs a two month old camera. no tricks, no bs, just go outside and see what 10(x) versus 10(r), 12 vs 36 mpx yields. both 28mm. one iso 40 f1.4, the other iso 1600, f5.6. focused same -----> spot !!! . both raw, pulled into lr, slight color balance performed to one shot to make it closer to the other, a crop from 2x3 to 3x4 to match the others native format, then both exported to the same output size. ie. effectively no image processing to help one way or the other. just a leveling of the playing field. which is which should be immediately obvious. or is it?

This is sensor dirt. All digital cameras with interchangable lenses have this problem, but an M10 is particularly prone, because there is no mirror as extra barrier and the lack of an AA filter makes the dirt more visible. One should prevent dust from entering the camera as much as possible. There are a number of strategies. 1. Avoid changing lenses more than necessary. 2. Change lenses in as much of a dust-free environment as possible 3. Keep the rear end of the lens as clean as possible 4. Change the lens with the camera mouth facing downwards 5. (This may be a myth) Switch off the camera before changing lenses. But dust will come on the sensor anyway. Consult the manual to find the sensor cleaning item in the menu and use a FULLY charged battery. Before opening the shutter blow out the camera (using a bulb blower, not compressed air or your mouth!) to dislodge any loose dust. If the dust on the sensor is loose one can blow off the sensor using a good bulb blower, (Rocket Blower by Giotto for instance) with the camera mouth facing downwards. If that does not clear the problem there are sensor brushes like the Arctic Butterfly by Visible Dust that are quite effective or the little vacuum cleaner by Green Clean. At this stage the use of a Sensor Loupe can be very helpful. If spots on the sensor persist you are dealing with stuck dirt like pollen or oil spots and need to revert to wet cleaning. There are numerous threads on the subject. The Visible Dust products are highly recommended or the Green Clean wet-and-dry method. Use a proper solvent for grease if you think you are dealing with oil etc. (Visible Dust Smear Away or Dust-Aid Sensor Clean (my preference) Open the shutter for cleaning and blow it once again with a bulb blower or vacuum clean it, to remove any loose particles which might be dragged across the sensor and cause scratches. Although the M9 is full frame and there are size 1 sensor swabs on the market, I prefer using the swabs for 1.3 sensors (and APS-C swabs for the M8) Take a clean swab, put on three small drops of Sensor Cleaning Fluid and in two sweeps, top and bottow go to one side - do not over-press!!- and sweep back again, using the other side of the swab automatically. Or, using the wet-and-dry system, swab with the wet sponge and dry with a couple of sweeps with the dry swab. Don't let the fluid spill over the edge of the sensor too much - there are electronic connections there. That is all - close the shutter and test the camera by taking an unfocussed image of an evenly lit surface at the smallest aperture. In the unlikely case it is needed, repeat. There are other cleaning systems, such as stamping tools. I find them quite effective, as long as there are no greasy spots on the sensor. Just stamp, don't rub. They are a bit scary as one pulls the cover glass. Leica Customer Service seem to be quite happy using them, so they should be safe. . There are also sensor cleaning services or Leica Customer Service, but those are expensive and will keep the camera for a while. They may also not be readily available if one is travelling. Sensor cleaning is something any owner should be able to do himself.

There is a very accurate dust detection feature with instructions in your camera's menu. A blower will just blow the dust about, and will do nothing for oil spots or 'attached' dust. Unless you live very close to a friendly store you have to learn to do it yourself, it is not difficult. The first step is to purchase some top brand and genuine swabs of the right size (get plenty) and liquid (or use uncontaminated IPA). In my experience, new Leica's need a wet clean early in their life as you seem to get an initial few oil spots that don''t repeat. You can then research and buy genuine products for subsequent 'dry' cleans, such as the gel pad sticks as used by Leica in the factory and 'static' brushes. Neither of the dry tools mentioned will remove oil, and will probably smear it around. Keep checking with the detection feature, be patient and expect it to take several repeat goes to get a perfect clean.

(this may be a myth) switch off the camera before changing lenses. but dust will come on the sensor anyway. consult the manual to find the sensor cleaning item in the menu and use a fully charged battery. before opening the shutter blow out the camera (using a bulb blower, not compressed air or your mouth!) to dislodge any loose dust. if the dust on the sensor is loose one can blow off the sensor using a good bulb blower, (rocket blower by giotto for instance) with the camera mouth facing downwards. if that does not clear the problem there are sensor brushes like the arctic butterfly by visible dust that are quite effective or the little vacuum cleaner by green clean. at this stage the use of a sensor loupe can be very helpful. if spots on the sensor persist you are dealing with stuck dirt like pollen or oil spots and need to revert to wet cleaning. there are numerous threads on the subject. the visible dust products are highly recommended or the green clean wet-and-dry method. use a proper solvent for grease if you think you are dealing with oil etc. (visible dust smear away or dust-aid sensor clean (my preference) open the shutter for cleaning and blow it once again with a bulb blower or vacuum clean it, to remove any loose particles which might be dragged across the sensor and cause scratches. although the m is full frame and there are size 1 sensor swabs on the market, i prefer using the swabs for 1.3 sensors (and aps-c swabs for the m8) take a clean swab, put on three small drops of sensor cleaning fluid and in two sweeps, top and bottow go to one side - do not over-press!!- and sweep back again, using the other side of the swab automatically. or, using the wet-and-dry system, swab with the wet sponge and dry with a couple of sweeps with the dry swab. don't let the fluid spill over the edge of the sensor too much - there are electronic connections there. that is all - close the shutter and test the camera by taking an unfocused image of an evenly lit surface at the smallest aperture. in the unlikely case it is needed, repeat. there are other cleaning systems, such as stamping tools. i find them quite effective, as long as there are no greasy spots on the sensor. just stamp, don't rub. they are a bit scary as one pulls the cover glass. leica customer service seem to be quite happy using them, so they should be safe. . there are also sensor cleaning services or leica customer service, but those are expensive and will keep the camera for a while. they may also not be readily available if one is travelling. sensor cleaning is something any owner should be able to do himself. if you are fairly certain your spots are oil or grease, it may be wise to omit the step with the arctic butterfly, as it may become contaminated by the grease. in case that happens it can be cleaned with the special fluid provided.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 15738, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 354921, "autor": "Good To Be Retired", "date": 1606838880000, "content": "On 11/16/2020 at 4:34 AM, olzen911 said: Hi there, i have some observations w/ my new used M Type 240, where i am looking for some answers (sorry for mixing up too many aspects): (1) When i take a photo on (A), quite often the picture is overexposed. Even when in C mode also the next pictures are like that. It then helps moving the camera away and then back to the point where is started to get the right exposure - any hints on settings or errors that may cause this? I'm not absolutely certain of this, it's more in the vein of a WAG, but it might be something to check. When in C mode some cameras maintain the meter reading for the first image in the sequence. Thus, if you blow the exposure on the first photo all the subsequent images in the sequence will be off also. I've never had occasion to check this on a Leica, but it might be something to look at. Additionally, verify that you don't have the metering mode set for Spot. Beyond that I have no idea. You might think about making all your exposure settings using a gray card for a day or so and perhaps you can discern some sort of pattern. (2) Other then that, i have a Summilux 50mm w/ 6-bit encoding, that is recognized by the cam correctly and also written in Exif. What often seems \"random\" is the aperture: even when i leave it at 1.4 it sometimes says 2.8 or whatever in Lightroom. On top i was asking myself how the cam knows about the aperture as no signal is transmitted This time it's the CAMERA making a WAG based on light level/exposure It will probably only occasionally be correct. (3) I also rented a 1.4 pre-asph, with retrofit 6-bit enc (just to see if i buy the asph or pre-asph), and this is not recognized by the cam. As the retro encoding was done by Leica, i do not think it is the lens - any experience / hints on that one? You might verify that the coding was actually done by Leica, I suspect that it was not. Otherwise, clean the windows on the camera body where the code is read and see if that makes any difference. Might not hurt to verify you have the correct code also.

Is this the one to go for, when trying to shoot wide open in the sun with summilux or rather take a third party 8?

The issue to me, and I just went through this, is what do I want to use? How much $$$ will a change cost me (M to SL or any other combo) ? What is ACCEPTABLE performance? What are my long term plans for a camera? Do I NEED AF? My particular situation is similar to yours.... I am an Amateur. Do not get paid to take pictures. Never. So buying a new camera is never justified financially. I do not need AF. Nice to have, but hardly required. I have a stable of M lenses, a few R lenses. I really like the M lens look. Really. But I want EVF focusing. AND I want better metering than the RF M cameras offer.....'Here is how I evaluated the choices.... Best user experience and IQ is an M10 ( + /- Suffix) with EVF. But that is only 24MP. Best IQ at 24MP (tied with M240). Coat is about $5-9K depending on new/used, and specific model. I can not justify that cost. Out of the question. M240 offers most of the M10 benefits ( lower EVF functionality and resolution, but.... to me these are small differences) Price point, right now, is $2K to $2,5K. Justifiable? Easier than $5K SL with adapter for M lenses.... The user experience is low with this combo, if you plan on focusing wide open and then stop down to take the shot. It is a big pain. Those of you old enough to remember preset lenses (1960'S, 1970'S) will know the pain. The metering is much IMPROVED over the M family of basically a spot meter. Cost right now is the $1800-$2500 range. About the same as a M240, or a bit lower. By far, the best user experience with IQ equal to the M240 or other M options, is the SL or SL2 WITH NATIVE SL LENSES. The lens choice is key.... results from the SL are truly magnificent. User experience is first rate. AF. Metering is as good as it gets. Why not take this choice..? Cost is in excess of $3K PER NETIVE MOUNT LENS!!! Times 2-3 lenses, and you are spending $10K-$15K++++. Ain't going to happen. If you are a new Dad, with kids growing up, the value of AF is WAY more than you think. I had taken the M lens plus Sony A7 route..... About the same as the SL + M lens route. ( Why Sony? Because the SL bodies were in the $ 4K range and the Sony was less than $1K) HATE the user experience!!! I NEED ( internal stubbornness) to focus at wide open. That is a royal pain, I gave up when I was about 15 years old and had my Miranda cameras. I now use native Sony lenses, with attendant lower IQ. Yes, I can tell. That lower IQ always bothered me. I have bought a M240 setup. Bigger files (18MP vs 24MP for more capable cropping in post)) than the M9, EVF capable ( for better focusing, although the EVF offers only at set aperture for focusing, the RF will work fine for most situations)..And the most important issue.... the best IQ that can be had. But I sacrificed AF, better metering, and even bigger files that the SL2 would offer me. I also saved $10K to $15K++++. I will suggest you buy a cheap Sl. Buy a M-SL adapter. See if you like the combo. It may be that focusing at working aperture is OK with you, or maybe you will not get crazy ( like me) for having to open up the lens to focus wide open. And keep your eyes out for a set of SL native lenses..... That's what I am doing... especially that last thought..... Native SL lenses..... It may take me a few years to get MY SL2 with lenses, but for now, I am happy with my choice. Take the road of most experimentation?????? SL + M lenses?

Just a little bit of a \"FWIW\" on a slightly more practical side to the question... Following-on from a similar thread a year or so ago I did some experiments to see whether it would be possible to use a deep-red filter and achieve acceptable results. My general observations were these; If the 'actual' focus-point as noted on the lens was moved (i.e. lens is near-focussed) from the central index mark to the first D-o-F index mark on the lens-mount then (roughly speaking) the focus would subsequently be pretty much spot-on for a deep-red filter regardless of which lens was tested but there WAS some minor variation - if shooting wide-open - from lens to lens. When each lens was stopped-down two stops from max aperture then the lens always seemed to deliver results which were more than acceptable. One lens which was an exception was a 1959 (v1) 21mm f4 where the 'actual' focus mark needed only to be turned half-way towards the first index mark. Moving further away resulted in unsharp images.

Anyone with good / bad things to say about that one? It seems to hit a sweet spot between build quality, performance, and price for me. For my own peace of mind, I did go ahead and send the body to Leica for the CLA / certificate / warranty. They said since they were inspecting it, once complete the sensor would be covered for the next 12 months (their words to me), and if the sensor is already bad, I would have had to cough up the dough to fix it anyway. If I shoot with it for the next 6 months and hate it (ha!), at least I will then have the remaining warranty as an additional perk for a potential buyer. Thanks to everyone who responded with all the good advice (even if I may have flown in the face of some....please forgive). I appreciate that there is a community of Leica-minded (see what I did there?) individuals to bounce ideas off. I probably would have just used it but I don\u2019t think you made a bad choice at all for peace of mind. Congrats and nice find. most of the voigtlander and Zeiss M lenses are fantastic and reasonably priced. my recommendation would be the 35 2.8 or 50 2.0 from Zeiss M mount. If you need faster, the 35 2 is solid. Both the first two can be bought in mint condition for $500 or less from reputable sources.

But once again, everything else is possible \ud83d\ude02 My argument only makes sense if one accepts that DR is synonymous with adjustment latitude. In that case the M10M can be considered to have great DR because it produces very little shot and read noise, less than the M 240, M10, SL and SL2, and, therefore, allows for more \u2018push-ability\u2019 of the shadows in post than any of these other cameras. What this means is that one is less limited in one\u2019s ability to decrease exposure to expose so as not to blow highlights in high contrast scenes, because one will have more latitude/scope to correct (brighten) dark tones in post-processing. However, a monochrome camera (from the M 246 onwards, it seems, not the M9M) will be more prone to blowing highlights than a camera with a color sensor because of the lack of color channels. Beyond that it gets too scientific for me. See Andy\u2019s posts in the thread below. One way to make the Monochrom less likely to blow sky highlights, for example, is to use an orange filter. I basically always use a yellow filter.

I suggest you to read this article (sorry still in french but the pictures before and after speak for themselves): https://www.konbini.com/fr/culture/retouche-photo-paolo-inirio-photoshop/ You understand now the importance compromise and the use of selective masking to achieve a great look which you can do with any good software (Lr, ACR, C1...etc..), of course it takes time but it may worth the time spent. If you shoot landscape or architecture for example it may easier because you can use gradient mask. With this photo taken with the M10M (it is not a good photo it is only for testing purpose) you can see the difference before and after, and the difference between the wrong usage of shadow/highlight recovery slider (middle) and one using mask (actualy gradient mask).

M10P firmware = 2.7.5.0 M10M firmware = 2.12.8.0 Test conditions: Leica 75/1.25 Noctilux @ f/5.6, which together with the 50 APO @ f/5.6 offers the highest MTF performance of any Leica M lens at any aperture (according to Leica's data) M10P ISO: 100, 400, 1600, 6400, 12500, 25000, 50000 M10M ISO: 160, 400, 1600, 6400, 12500, 25000, 50000, 100000 Auto shutter speed 2-second delay before capture (to eliminate tripod shake) Both cameras were mounted to the same tripod and aimed at the same spot on the subject. Live view at 100% was used to confirm that the optimal focus setting of the lens was the same for both cameras. All DNG files were imported into Capture One 20, desaturated, processed with identical settings, then highest quality JPGs of each image were exported.

In terms of background noise, after scaling the M10P or M10M images up or down to the same size (41 MP or 24 MP), I see about a 1.5-stop noise advantage for the M10M. In terms of \"usable\" high-ISO image quality for monochrome images, I would set my personal threshold around ISO 18,000 for the M10P, and around 50,000 for the M10M (also a 1.5-stop advantage for the M10M). But the surprise, for me, was that in terms of capturing subject detail, the combination of higher resolution, lack of a Bayer CFA, and (my guess) a better sensor even on a per-unit-area basis together resulted in the M10M at ISO 25,000 capturing as much or more detail in the subject than the M10P did at any ISO. Of course, if you are shooting street photography, kids running, dreamy portraits, etc. the subject detail capture level difference probably won't matter.

In reality, the \"bottleneck\" of the focusing beam at the focusing plane is a fuzzy circle. The off-focus blurring is far less than that idealized calculation. So I take my 25mm ZM and M240 to check the more realistic impact of the 0.1mm light path. On my lens, near the infinite, if I turn the lens focusing ring to move the lens about 0.1mm, everything in 30m is blurring. This means the off-focus infinite is far more than the 2.5m. I then take the nearest object (0.5m) for the test, I check the blurring if I move the focus to make about 0.1mm focus-off, and check the image through the EVF with focus peaking at the max enlargement, to my eye, I can't tell the difference. These tests indicate: 1: at infinite distance, the 0.1mm light path difference cam make the object at X distance falls on the image plane supposed to be infinite. The X is far more than 30M. 2: at nearest distance(0.5M), the 0.1mm light path difference is impossible to judge where is the optimal. Note that the above tests are based on the M240 EVF (or live view), which theoretically is applicable to M9. However, with M9 OVF, your focusing judge should be much less accurate.

RE changing the color profile. To get a certain answer, I would want to measure camera spectral response of a stock and converted camera because the color response is a combination of the filter and the camera RGB response. For example, the glass in the M9 I measured goes down to 300nm but the sensor has very little sensitivity down there. But I think you would notice very little difference and if you set a custom White Balance, then probably no difference at all. Here is the M9 ICF that I measured versus a typical ICF. --img--  I would like to study the color response and light transmission, and ideally we would have your opinions, MaxMax and Kolari. First some anecdotical points showing the importance to me of the color response which is much of the appeal of the Leica M9: 1. I used to have 5-6 years ago a Leica M9-P which had an official sensor change by Leica. The color response of the sensor had however changed, and was not just a matter of White Balance - the color palette was nice, but different; also in addition the pictures became slightly sharper, luminosity was slightly reduced and the images slightly colder (not as Kodachrome like anymore). As you know the firmware was updated after the official sensor change, which is not the case for the suggested \"only glass change\" solutions - so same camera RGB response. 2. Due to this I had bought again a Leica M9 with original sensor without corrosion at the time - I think it was one of the first ones produced - (with the feeling that if something happened I could still have the official sensor changed). The colors are indeed more like Kodachrome. I could not check the camera in time to see the spots that now in retrospect seem to have appeared around July 2020 especially since there was no pre-announcement by Leica that the sensor change program would end in Aug. Either way, I would like to stick to the \"old\" colours as much as possible if I aim to perform such as sensor glass change. Based on data from Schott, and as non expert, I am trying to understanding the color response of the two solutions being suggested, original M9, MaxMax and Kolari: - On the original M9, the original sensor cover glass was S8612 0.8mm (based on comments on this forum).

I downloaded the naming convention documents years ago- all this is gone from the website now. I probably have the naming convention PDF file somewhere on one of 12 computers. I have a lot of computers. It is not possible to change the color dye in the old sensor at this point. It would be worth looking at images taken of color charts before and after the conversion and possibly providing some software to make the new color-space closer to the old one. IR leakage would be a problem for something like this. I ended up writing my own software to process M Monochrom, M9, and M8 DNG files. They read and modify the values without going through the demosaic process. On the M Monochrom, apply a gamma curve and use 16-bits per pixel instead of 14 for the output. On the M8: use an Orange filter to cut out Blue channel, leave it IR only. Then equalize it to get a Visible+IR image. On the M9- Jaap stated that a yellow filter would render better Monochrome. Convert the M9 files to linear DNG with a custom interpolation process. Maybe something similar to scale the new color response back to the old one might work. Image hacking.

That body is slightly ever so larger, so I expected the script to be bigger, too. But if you'll take a closer look, the script seems to align with the shutter speed dial marker on both the 240 and my M9. Drawing a continuous line from the marker cuts through the lower half of the script body, as you can see the \"ca\" are cut at about the same on both engravings. So this might explain the reasoning behind the smaller font for our models, maybe? Perhaps, that marker was used as a reference point to line up the script...I notice, however, the M9-P, M10-P and leaked images of the M10-R \"Leica\" engravings do not line up with the marker......Mine measures slightly smaller, at 18mm x 8.5mm. I'm guessing due to differences in the finish account for the thickness of the engraving, or variations?... Interesting about the alignment with the speed marker. Well spotted! However this, in itself, wouldn't neccessarily explain the different sizes of logo as regardless of whether it was the smaller or larger logo the whole engraving would only have to be moved a fraction of a millimetre to align in such fashion. I've just checked the engraving on my M-D 262 and it lines-up just the same even although it has the larger logo. OK, what about this; the original M9 bodies were made in Solms and had the larger size of engraving. The larger logo is, visually, a 'better fit' on the digital-M sized bodies. The refurb'd bodies, OTOH, were assembled in Wetzlar after the release of the M10. The M10, famously, saw the digi-body return to using pretty much the same body-dimensions with the earlier film bodies. Does the M10 have the smaller engraving? The smaller engraving on my MM1 is the same size as that on my M2. Was the smaller logo introduced to be a better (and more historically 'accurate') fit on the reduced size of the new M10 top-plate? If so then perhaps the new tooling for the M10 is the reason the refurb'd bodies have the smaller logo? Just thinking out loud... Philip.

Thanks again Pete - I actually did get out my old, old, old, Sekonic \"Studio Deluxe III L-398A\" exposure meter, but I've long since forgotten how to use it. Fortunately I have the manual with it, so in an hour or so, I should be all set.

With due respect my experience has been the polar opposite of yours. So good, in fact, were the images taken with the first example I acquired that I bought a second example for my other body. Furthermore the lens is anything but a \"one trick pony\"; once stopped-down past the 'glow' stage - from around f2 to f2.8 - the lens is almost as sharp as my 50mm Summicron and can therefore be used just as an everyday 'Standard' without any noticeable image IQ issues whatsoever. I have undertaken studio-based tests to confirm this observation. Certainly it is highly unlikely that anyone looking at a pair of prints - one taken on the Summicron and the other on the 7A - could spot any difference whatsoever. It is, however, very true that each lens has to be carefully calibrated for any one particular body - mine do not perform in exactly the same manner on the 'wrong' body - and so I suspect that the lens you shot with on digital but did not own was nowhere near properly calibrated for the body you used.

I agree. Taking the trouble to ensure absolute calibration between body and lens is, to be perfectly honest, a right royal pain in the butt because 'Close Enough' isn't close enough. Oddly, though, there was one up-side to this; when I originally bought my pair of 50 f1.1 lenses I was using them on an M8.2 and an M9-P and, as mentioned in my earlier post, each had one particular lens calibrated for each body. In the course of time these bodies made way for an M Monochrom and an M-D Typ-262 and the calibration process was duly undertaken once again. After much head-scratching (neither lens could be calibrated to work perfectly on either body) I eventually discovered - by testing the bodies with various other lenses - that both bodies needed to have their rangefinder cams tweaked fractionally. I hadn't owned either body long (less than a fortnight) and hadn't observed any problems with my other lenses - neither had seen much use at all and, additionally, I rarely shoot wide-open - so I didn't notice anything was awry until I tried to nail focus at f1.1.

Prologue: For me, it might be the perfect hybrid. At least this is what I am trying to figure out. I have tried dozens of cameras from all brands. While I fell in love with Leica about a year ago and have been using since the Q2 and M10P/R, it was far from a good hybrid solution. I do 50% photos/videos, and I have high expectations for both. As many of you may know already, the best hybrid for me lately, after trying the R5, the A7RIV, the SL2, and many others, has been the A7SIII: superb videos, and superb photos. Extremely versatile, and a good selection of lenses + the possibility to adapt M lenses with good results on the new BSI sensor. But it's not Leica. It feels soulless, and uninspiring. While the photos are great, they are not magic. Then came the SL2-S. I tried it on day one in the store side by side with my A7SIII, came back home, saw the photos, they looked the same, and I was disappointed. I decided to stick with the Sony.... until one hour later I couldn't stop thinking about the SL2-S and I went back to buy it. I took a leap of faith. Now, I will try it for 4 weeks without touching my Sony, to see if it can not only replace it, but become my new go to camera. I have been on the search for the perfect hybrid camera for years, without success. Introduction - the lens before the body: The perfect hybrid for me is the camera that not only gives me excellent stills and videos, but also the one that can be paired with one lens good enough that I never need to buy another one in my life. 35mm being my focal length, Sony could not match this criteria. The sigma 35 1.2 is a fine lens, but too big and not that perfect. For the SL2, it seems like the 35 SL APO is a serious contender of \"best 35 of ever made in history of photography\", so one point for Leica here. That being said, the first part of this \"first impressions\" will focus on manual lenses since ive only played around with my SL2S with M lenses only so far. Here is part 1 of my first impression: Build Quality: Not much to say here, because there's no competition between Sony and Leica. Next to the SL2S, the A7SIII feel like a toy, and not even a premium toy. A toy like the ones you get in a happy meal. The SL2S is a TANK! Just like my M, it feels like im carrying a undestroybale jewel. It is a joy to hold. I might still be deep in the honeymoon, but I seriously want to sleep with it. I want to wake up in the night just to touch it. Ergonomy: Same here, no competition. Im new to the SL so that might be nothing new to you, but the SL is perfect. The place of the buttons is ideal, the shortcuts are exactly what I need. Nothing more nothing less. The only complaint I have is that you cannot remap to anything you want. I wish I could have a button to switch between APCS and 35mm mode in movies but I cant. Thats a real pity. Ease of use and Interface: I feel reborn. Straight to the point, clean, simple, intuitive. A big change from Sony's horrible and cluttered menus. Look: No competition, Lecia wins again. Overall, because of the Build quality, the ergonomics and the interface, I want to pick up my camera all the time. It's inspiring. It feels like tradition of photography. Image Quality: It's gorgeous. It's superior to my previous favourite camera, the Q2. The colours looks so beautiful, better than my M10R and my Q2. The AWB is the most surprising part, it's always spot on, better than my M by far. The M lenses ive tried look perfect, even better than the M. The addition of ibis, that incredible EVF and focus peaking makes me miss much less photos, they are all sharp and in focus to the point that except for when a small size is needed, I don't see myself ever wanting to pick up my M over my SL right now. About the EVF, it has less dots than the A7SIII, but for some reasons it looks more beautiful, with colours that are more true to life. The image is just STELLAR! So so happy with it. Low light: it's something important to me. if it is going to be my perfect hybrid, it needs to be versatile. The Q, for example, I can barely use it at night. It just doesn't work for me. The SL2S seem to be an incredible performer. I might even dare to say its better than the A7SIII. Sure, there is more noise at 50k ISO than on the sony, but the grain is fine. The colours aren't muted and desaturated, and the image doesn't look like it suffered heavy nose reduction by a computer like the sony. Yes, the sony sees in the dark, but the Leica is more organic, more like a film photo. Leica wins, surprisingly. Video: at first I didn't like it, and that's because its not good out of the box. But once I switch it to C4K, 10 bit 422, HLG profile, I think it beats the Sony. I need more testing, but I was shocked by the first results. Paired with an M lens, the image is INCREDIBLE. Leica colours in video. And just like stills, they are so easy and enjoyable to manipulate in post. Also, the in body stabilisation is uncomparable to sony. its a class above. I have tried low light video at 12,500 ISO and it was as clean as my sony, with better colours. So first results are amazing. The things I don't like: No tilt screen, although I don't know for sure that I would sacrifice that against build quality and weatherproofing, and the fact that I cant remap the shortcut button to anything I want. I probably missed a lot of things, but the point is that as far as Manual Focus use is concerned, the SL2S has destroyed my Sony A7SIII. It's better at everything. I feel freed. But..... There will be a second part to my testing: AF lenses. Unfortunately, this is where I fear that the Sony might take the advantage again, with its stellar AF performance. Im picking up the 35 SL APO this week. I will test and keep you posted. Feel free to ask me if you have any question.

Prologue: For me, it might be the perfect hybrid. At least this is what I am trying to figure out. I have tried dozens of cameras from all brands. While I fell in love with Leica about a year ago and have been using since the Q2 and M10P/R, it was far from a good hybrid solution. I do 50% photos/videos, and I have high expectations for both. As many of you may know already, the best hybrid for me lately, after trying the R5, the A7RIV, the SL2, and many others, has been the A7SIII: superb videos, and superb photos. Extremely versatile, and a good selection of lenses + the possibility to adapt M lenses with good results on the new BSI sensor. But it's not Leica. It feels soulless, and uninspiring. While the photos are great, they are not magic. Then came the SL2-S. I tried it on day one in the store side by side with my A7SIII, came back home, saw the photos, they looked the same, and I was disappointed. I decided to stick with the Sony.... until one hour later I couldn't stop thinking about the SL2-S and I went back to buy it. I took a leap of faith. Now, I will try it for 4 weeks without touching my Sony, to see if it can not only replace it, but become my new go to camera. I have been on the search for the perfect hybrid camera for years, without success. Introduction - the lens before the body: The perfect hybrid for me is the camera that not only gives me excellent stills and videos, but also the one that can be paired with one lens good enough that I never need to buy another one in my life. 35mm being my focal length, Sony could not match this criteria. The sigma 35 1.2 is a fine lens, but too big and not that perfect. For the SL2, it seems like the 35 SL APO is a serious contender of \"best 35 of ever made in history of photography\", so one point for Leica here. That being said, the first part of this \"first impressions\" will focus on manual lenses since ive only played around with my SL2S with M lenses only so far. Here is part 1 of my first impression: Build Quality: Not much to say here, because there's no competition between Sony and Leica. Next to the SL2S, the A7SIII feel like a toy, and not even a premium toy. A toy like the ones you get in a happy meal. The SL2S is a TANK! Just like my M, it feels like im carrying a undestroybale jewel. It is a joy to hold. I might still be deep in the honeymoon, but I seriously want to sleep with it. I want to wake up in the night just to touch it. Ergonomy: Same here, no competition. Im new to the SL so that might be nothing new to you, but the SL is perfect. The place of the buttons is ideal, the shortcuts are exactly what I need. Nothing more nothing less. The only complaint I have is that you cannot remap to anything you want. I wish I could have a button to switch between APCS and 35mm mode in movies but I cant. Thats a real pity. Ease of use and Interface: I feel reborn. Straight to the point, clean, simple, intuitive. A big change from Sony's horrible and cluttered menus. Look: No competition, Lecia wins again. Overall, because of the Build quality, the ergonomics and the interface, I want to pick up my camera all the time. It's inspiring. It feels like tradition of photography. Image Quality: It's gorgeous. It's superior to my previous favourite camera, the Q2. The colours looks so beautiful, better than my M10R and my Q2. The AWB is the most surprising part, it's always spot on, better than my M by far. The M lenses ive tried look perfect, even better than the M. The addition of ibis, that incredible EVF and focus peaking makes me miss much less photos, they are all sharp and in focus to the point that except for when a small size is needed, I don't see myself ever wanting to pick up my M over my SL right now. About the EVF, it has less dots than the A7SIII, but for some reasons it looks more beautiful, with colours that are more true to life. The image is just STELLAR! So so happy with it. Low light: it's something important to me. if it is going to be my perfect hybrid, it needs to be versatile. The Q, for example, I can barely use it at night. It just doesn't work for me. The SL2S seem to be an incredible performer. I might even dare to say its better than the A7SIII. Sure, there is more noise at 50k ISO than on the sony, but the grain is fine. The colours aren't muted and desaturated, and the image doesn't look like it suffered heavy nose reduction by a computer like the sony. Yes, the sony sees in the dark, but the Leica is more organic, more like a film photo. Leica wins, surprisingly. Video: at first I didn't like it, and that's because its not good out of the box. But once I switch it to C4K, 10 bit 422, HLG profile, I think it beats the Sony. I need more testing, but I was shocked by the first results. Paired with an M lens, the image is INCREDIBLE. Leica colours in video. And just like stills, they are so easy and enjoyable to manipulate in post. Also, the in body stabilisation is uncomparable to sony. its a class above. I have tried low light video at 12,500 ISO and it was as clean as my sony, with better colours. So first results are amazing. The things I don't like: No tilt screen, although I don't know for sure that I would sacrifice that against build quality and weatherproofing, and the fact that I cant remap the shortcut button to anything I want. I probably missed a lot of things, but the point is that as far as Manual Focus use is concerned, the SL2S has destroyed my Sony A7SIII. It's better at everything. I feel freed. But..... There will be a second part to my testing: AF lenses. Unfortunately, this is where I fear that the Sony might take the advantage again, with its stellar AF performance. Im picking up the 35 SL APO this week. I will test and keep you posted. Feel free to ask me if you have any question.

The Panasonic lens is no doubt a good perforer (I just bought one) but performing quite a lot better than the APO SL 2/50 - I don\u2019t think I buy that. Is it due to the camera body? Pcmag.com tested the Panasonic 50/1.4 and and the 75 SL. The 75 SL is sharper at all tested apertures.

The 35/50SL are both second gen SL lenses that incorporated newer tech And more ASPH surfaces; im wondering what this 3rd round of SL lenses will have to show.

I think he pretty much goes through the issues likely to be discussed regarding the merits of this versus that in his own inimical manner. Interestingly despite the compelling 'value' to be found in Nikon|Canon|Fuji|Sony land - he bought an SL2 and has the 35 APO Summicron on order - make of that what you will. I just see another person who has decided that what feels good in hand and makes one happy walking around /contemplating and looking for the next shot - is the most important part of the journey. So my walking and happy snap companion is now my SL2 and the 35 Summicron is my favourite L mount lens. I am certain that other manufacturers will bing out very impressive 'better' lenses like they always have at much lower prices, like they always have - but I like using Leica cameras and lenses. IF Nikon wish to impress me with value for money systems - they can try and match Fuji which is my utilitarian system - Fuji is the relevant benchmark for 'value' - Leica is about 'fun'. This is not a Nikon bash btw - great company great products - just like every other company making cameras and lenses today . I was really just posting about the Nikon 50/1.8 to make the point that the SL Summicron lineup may be, unfortunately for us SL shooters, not as ground breaking as initially sold/marketed. I really did believe the SL lenses were the end all, and better than any other mirrorless line-up. It was one of the reasons I switched to the SL from an A7r4/r3 (aside from being able to use my M lenses). here\u2019s the Nikon Z 85/1.8, much stronger showing than the 50/1.8Z and of course the Leica Summicron 75/2 SL. I do thoroughly enjoy using my 50 SL APO, but it stings a little to know it\u2019s not the revolutionary glass I thought it to be.

I did more testing and reading about white balance in general, the role of \"tint\" and color casts by fluorescent lights. Based on the tests it seems that the TL2's white-balance, if I want accurate whites, is actually closer to what it should be than the GF3's. The temperature is much closer, but it adds the greenish tint - probably tricked by the light. The GF3 also adds tint (the magenta), so that is also tricked, and the temperature is more off towards warm colors. This based on selecting a white spot in ON1 and how the sliders jump from the ooc temperture and tint sliders in the TL2 and GF3 raw files. So it is just a question of white-balance, and a question of if I want true whites and accurate colors or want to have a little warmth to the pictures (but not accurate whites) to have the same feeling. Very interesting findings. Based on this I think I'll definitely keep the TL2 due to its superior performance. And adjusting the white-balance is just one click (picking a white spot on the picture) or, as you suggested, a simple copy from another picture from the same scene. I also learned to use the greycard, giving better results.

I just read something on Sonyalpharumors that may shed some light on the apparent autofocus issues some of us have experienced with the lens: Sigma has decided to postpone the 70-200mm f/2.8 FE lens launch to autumn 2020. One of the sources says the reason has to do with Sigma trying to improve the autofocus algorithm. This works very good on prime lenses but is said to not be flawless on zoom lenses. They need time to improve it. It stands to reason that AF accuracy would be more of a concern on a lens with a constant f/2.8 aperture than on one with f/6.3 at the long end.

For what it's worth, this is my first Leica (and monochrome sensor at that) as well, but it's difficult to say whether this is \"normal\". I am not an expert and won't pretend to be as much, but it's something I am aware happens on any digital sensor (I have seen it manifest on at least one DSLR I owned prior, a Nikon D2X) albeit not quite in such a large number. I cannot personally speak to whether this phenomenon is common or observable on M sensors, but anecdotally I believe it is either very minimal or not present based on everything I've read about other people's experiences with them. Now, this could be due to the fact that we're talking about 47 million pixels, a few of which may have issues as part of a normal manufacturing process (this is similar to high definition displays like a MacBook Pro or LED HDTV, where pixel defects are not uncommon, and manufacturers may sometimes in fact indicate an \"acceptable\" number of defective pixels before the warranty coverage kicks in). It could also be due to the fact that this is an issue present with nearly any camera, and we're used to not seeing it because software usually resolves these defects for us (as theorized above re: Lightroom/Adobe shortcomings). Personally I just find the issue to be annoying but not especially concerning (I don't think the Q2M has an inherent flaw). I thought at first it was just an unusually \"pixelated\" unit, but again, perhaps this is something that's normally not observable, and is only presenting itself currently because of some software issue. Leica has invited me to send along a RAW exposure for evaluation, and indicated there is no firmware update/process available (which isn't surprising). I will share any relevant information Leica provides as part of this. Again, I don't want to exaggerate the issue, and I do feel like I'm being a little nitpicky (which I'll argue is justified with a $6k instrument), but I'm just the type of person that can't shake the feeling that those white dots are there, especially now that I can see them without having to zoom in (once your eyes know where to look, they always jump to those spots). I would be just as happy knowing it's an Adobe issue as I would be knowing this is just simply expected behavior (which just means the camera is not for me).

I will try to take lots of pictures with my Q2M over the weekend, focusing on ISO 800 and higher :). It is strange that the hot pixels appear only at higher ISOs. We see here that something happens at ISO 800 (dual gain?), which causes hot pixels to show. I might not be setting things correctly, but in my case it seems thatt hey are more defined at lower iso, but not always and not as many - it varies a bit how many per iso setting. At higher iso they get a bit more blurred and it's hard to distinguish from what i assume it's noise - LR with spot finder and visualizer slider being used; at higher iso, has to be moved to the left quite a bit. The main thing here to me, it's to make Leica aware that owners are concerned about a potential issue/phenomenon and there is no official explanation...yet. If indeed just like the batteries, that a certain amount of use is needed to bring it to full performance (batteries is ofcourse full charge cycles), I don't see why that was not mentioned. What? Don't they know tat people are going to analyze the shots to death, at pixel level, above and beyond needed? It happens with every new camera. I cannot actually see them in my normal pictures, but have not really look deeply into it, or tried to match the white dots in the shots with cap on to other shots (as a mask overlay). Also so far I have been using mostly iso 100.

I've seen reviews that emphasize the robustness of the Leica X-U, but I wonder...A very good idea. The camera is outstanding. I have it myself and it is still my favourite camera. Waterproof and dustproof. I use it for street photography as well as for hiking in the Alps or when it rains. I'll never sell the camera. - Is the 1/2000th in bright daylight at F1.7 very limiting? I like to take pictures at all times of the day when I travel, quite often with the sky wide open, but it seems that there is no way to apply ND filters to the X-U. So would it be essential to stop in Las Vegas in the middle of a day? When I was new to manual settings, I also often used f1.7. Over time, I learned that the main purpose of the aperture is to improve the depth of field. You control the rest with the exposure time and ISO value. The aperture f1.7 is not everything in darker situations. I therefore first set the aperture (what distance do I want to focus on), then the exposure time (how fast is my subject, do I want to show motion blur) and finally the ISO value (the Leica has a high potential for this). You can also optonally increase or decrease the exposure by a few steps (EV+/-) or use an exposure time series (the camera then takes three pictures). - Is AF bad? I noticed in one member's great review on this site that she hinted that she missed the focus when she was composing and was half under pressure. Granted, she was swimming while snorkeling, but she still made it sound like the autofocus on this camera might not be the best, especially under water/dark conditions.It depends on what you expect. It is slower compared to the CL or Ricoh for example. Yes. With the settings for exposure metering 1 point or spot, it produces solid results. But: The focus is a contrast focus. And it's hard to do in dark conditions. Here you can switch to manual focus. You have to try several times at this point. - What is the battery life like? Does it last a decent part of the day?It's hard to answer such a question. It depends on how much you do with it. For a day trip I take maybe 120 pictures. The battery is good enough for that. But I always take another one with me anyway. - Does the construction cause problems in strong sunlight? There is no protection from the sun, so I wondered how the optical coatings help to reduce internal reflections etc. The coating is very good. Reflections are rare. But they do happen from time to time (street lighting, for example https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz7KO5wou_v/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). - What is the overall IQ in 2020? I don't expect it to be able to compete with an M, but I wonder how it will look compared to a CL with 23 mm etc. The CL is newer and more modern. But you should consider one thing. The X-U has an f1.7 Summilux lens. This is the second best lens series at Leica, even before the Summicron. Look at the prices for a Summilux-TL or for the Summilux-M. This is probably the biggest deal on the X-U (same as the Leica X Typ 113 =X-U with less robustness, but with filter options). And the X-U is waterproof and dustproof. And high quality. And probably the long last of its kind. You can already see that from the second-hand market prices. Such a similar Leica model won't be in the program for a long time. Even though I very much hope so. Here in the forum (also in the German section) and my Instagram account you can find some shots with the X-U. You can also find information about the settings there.
