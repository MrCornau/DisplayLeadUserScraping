The second frame floats around.

(Sorry, I don\u2019t know what percentage is required to allow the use of the word completely \ud83d\ude44) You seem to have very little faith in the longevity of the digital M line. Why would they stop working in 3 weeks, 3 months or 3 years? I have classics analog synths - a 1972 Moog and a 1976 Polyphonic Korg - which still work perfectly and I see no reason why they would suddenly stop working any time soon. My 22 year old Nikon cool pix 950 still works perfectly. The battery which came with my M9 almost 12 years ago is still fine, I could go on. Even so, why do you seem to think the 240 would last any longer? There is always a risk with electronics devices, anyone buying a digital camera knows that. It has been written many times before on this forum, it\u2019s not because an M10, 11, 12 or 13 are released that previous models suddenly become obsolete or any less good than they were. The fact is the M9 is the only full frame CCD Leica. That makes it unique and that is why all the other so called improvements are irrelevant. If someone wants one, it\u2019s still a good - the only - option. Well nothing lasts forever. The risk with the m9 isn\u2019t that it might break down, it\u2019s that it might break down and Leica might not have the parts any longer. (Like with some m8 parts, eg the lcd) The same will be true for the 240, the 10 and even the 11. But not any time soon as they\u2019re newer cameras that Leica still have parts to repair them. The m9 is not any more or any less likely to suffer an issue than other cameras. It\u2019s just less likely to be repairable due to the age and in particular Leica\u2019s proclivity not to keep an infinite number of spares for their models. the m9 isn\u2019t just the only ff CCD leica, AFAIK it\u2019s the only ff CCD anywhere. So yes in that respect it\u2019s the only gig in town. My 240 will go to wetzlar soon to have some pixels mapped out. I wonder if my m9 needed that work doing what they would say? If I drop my 9 and break the lcd, I wonder if leica still have any to replace it? There\u2019s no reason the m9 WILL have a problem.. but all things CAN have a problem, and a complication with the m9 is the age and lack of support Remember, there\u2019s no m9 sensors left because the supplier stopped making them, first Kodak, then the company that bought out Kodak\u2019s sensor production.

I have to say: I've *never* looked at any of my photos with a goal of obtaining a particular film's look and feel, even the photos made with my film cameras. When my medium was 100% film, I chose what film I wanted to work with based on its colors and response curve (always slide film) and just worked with it to get what my eye wanted ... That's much the same as what I do today with instant print cameras since I only ever use B&W negative film otherwise today. What a given B&W film produces is mostly determined by its color sensitivity response curves, which I map with a Color Checker and my usual developing sludge (*all* my film gets the same soup) and the minor nuances of grain and acutance are things I push on to achieve what my eye wants, which isn't necessarily what the film's look and feel are supposed to be. When I am shooting with digital capture, I usually have in mind what I'm looking for as output and it's never a matter of \"I want it to look like 1970s Tri-X in D76\" or some such malarkey as that. I want expressive tonal scale that fits the subject, color tones if I want a polychrome rendering that suits my ideas, and I'll add or subtract grain to make it look the way my eye wants, even if I don't remember what film and developer looked like that once upon a time. So this notion of striving for a \"film look\" seems to me to be mostly talking in circles about things that do not matter. Strive to make photographs that express what you see/feel about the subject, with whatever capture medium you use. Who cares what film it might have once looked like? It's unimportant.

If Sigma wasn\u2019t in the Alliance, I don\u2019t think I would get into the L-mount system. As far as bodies go, having been an M shooter for over 10yrs with a fairly complete set of M lenses that I like, I\u2019d definitely go for an Leica body. For L-mount lenses though, Sigma has a few unique lenses that have no equivalent options from Panasonic or Leica. A good example is the 14-24mm DG DN zoom which is great for astrophotography. As far as SL lenses go, the primes have a very unique modern look with the smooth bokeh and low contrast OOF areas that I don\u2019t think any other lens (even SL zooms) can replicate. To me, these will become classics (assuming they keep working 30+ years from now) whereas the current Leica SL zooms, although offering better sharpness compared to their Panasonic and Sigma equivalents is 2-3x more expensive and doesn\u2019t seem to have a rendering that stands out from the other options. For me, it\u2019s nice to have a sharp lens with good micro contrast if you\u2019re printing but most images these days are consumed digitally and are compressed. For this reason, most subtle improvements in micro contrast will be completely destroyed and go unappreciated when the images are shared digitally. On the other hand, a lens that offers a unique rendering/drawing/bokeh can be appreciated even on an iPad and that to me is very appealing. In other words, if I needed a decent zoom, I would probably go with a Sigma or Panasonic option and put the money I save into the real unique lenses like the SL primes. Hi Beewee, Thank you for the comments. Yes the L-Alliance makes the decision easier. Your comments regarding the Sigma lenses unique offerings will cause me to look at little harder at what that means, in some ways I have been focused on the body and knowing there is flexibility in lens selection has made that an easier decision. I think once I settle on the body, I will need to do more thinking about the lenses and work out a little road map based not he current offerings. Your comment regarding the unique rendering that the Summicrons provide vs the more generic Leica Zoom offering is one I really need to consider. I was going to start with the 24-90 and one of the bodies, but it sounds like I should not make the decision with out some more thought. I am sure I will purchase some primes if I enjoy the using the body and zoom but it will come after the zoom as I was planning on using M primes initially. I am going to look around on the forum for discussions on the zooms. Thank you for specifically pointing that out!!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317060-sl2-or-sl2-s-advice-appreciated/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4121514", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "11 hours ago, beewee said: i feel the same about this. if sigma wasn\u2019t in the alliance, i don\u2019t think i would get into the l-mount system. as far as bodies go, having been an m shooter for over 10yrs with a fairly complete set of m lenses that i like, i\u2019d definitely go for an leica body. for l-mount lenses though, sigma has a few unique lenses that have no equivalent options from panasonic or leica. a good example is the 14-24mm dg dn zoom which is great for astrophotography. as far as sl lenses go, the primes have a very unique modern look with the smooth bokeh and low contrast oof areas that i don\u2019t think any other lens (even sl zooms) can replicate. to me, these will become classics (assuming they keep working 30+ years from now) whereas the current leica sl zooms, although offering better sharpness compared to their panasonic and sigma equivalents is 2-3x more expensive and doesn\u2019t seem to have a rendering that stands out from the other options. for me, it\u2019s nice to have a sharp lens with good micro contrast if you\u2019re printing but most images these days are consumed digitally and are compressed. for this reason, most subtle improvements in micro contrast will be completely destroyed and go unappreciated when the images are shared digitally. on the other hand, a lens that offers a unique rendering/drawing/bokeh can be appreciated even on an ipad and that to me is very appealing. in other words, if i needed a decent zoom, i would probably go with a sigma or panasonic option and put the money i save into the real unique lenses like the sl primes. hi beewee, thank you for the comments. yes the l-alliance makes the decision easier. your comments regarding the sigma lenses unique offerings will cause me to look at little harder at what that means, in some ways i have been focused on the body and knowing there is flexibility in lens selection has made that an easier decision. i think once i settle on the body, i will need to do more thinking about the lenses and work out a little road -----> map !!!  based not he current offerings. your comment regarding the unique rendering that the summicrons provide vs the more generic leica zoom offering is one i really need to consider. i was going to start with the 24-90 and one of the bodies, but it sounds like i should not make the decision with out some more thought. i am sure i will purchase some primes if i enjoy the using the body and zoom but it will come after the zoom as i was planning on using m primes initially. i am going to look around on the forum for discussions on the zooms. thank you for specifically pointing that out!!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 30966, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 419706, "autor": "BernardC", "date": 1629727140000, "content": " 1 hour ago, MITDelay said: From this article, Panasonic will stick to improving the contrast detection autofocus with DFD.
