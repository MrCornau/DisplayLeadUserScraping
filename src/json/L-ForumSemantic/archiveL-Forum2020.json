But since you asked, here is how Salgado handles it now: http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/the-pov-interview-sebastiaeo-salgado \"POV: When did you switch to digital? Salgado: Very recently, in 2008. After what happened in New York in 2001, airport security started to change, and in a month it became hell. I remember once, after working in Guatemala, I lost 52 rolls of film because of the X-rays at the airport. So I changed to digital, but I don\u2019t know how to edit on a computer. So what happened was that I had my assistants produce a contact sheet for me. I edit with a loupe like I always did, and when I edit they produce a work print like I always did, and when I make my final selection, we produce a negative from the digital archive in a quality that is better than when I photographed directly with a negative camera. From this archive, we introduce the grain from the Tri-X film that I worked with my whole life, and they produce for me a 4\u00d75-inch negative, then we go to the enlarger and we print again.\" POV: And now you print it out, it will still be silver nitrate, if you want it to be silver nitrate\u2026\" Salgado: Yeah. We print from an enlarger, with the grain of the film I\u2019ve used all of my life, and I don\u2019t lose any grain.
