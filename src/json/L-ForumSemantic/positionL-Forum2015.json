On the M, all lenses actually have an eight-bit code, with two extra bits derived from the \"frame lug\" on the mount that mechanically selects the frame lines shown. On the M8 (the last time these details were visible) there were separate lookup tables (LUTs) for the corrections of each of the three WATE settings. I suspect the reason that the list of identifiable R lenses on the Ms is rather short has to do with the limited number of possible places available in this LUT name space. In the SL, this may have been fixed. But the fact that the T-M adapter doesn't pay attention to mechanical linkages on the M lenses is not encouraging to those of us who would like to see aperture awareness or auto aperture stop down for R lenses, which requires mechanically activating one of the cams in the R mounts. In R lenses, lens maximum aperture awareness and current aperture setting requires reading the position of two of the cams in the camera. AASD requires controlling the position of the mechanical diaphragm stop-down lever. The M obtains the additional information from the frame line coupling cam, a part of the lens bayonet flange, which there might not be enough room to implement in the thin M Adapter T unit. And the WATE and MATE are the only two lenses for which this information is needed; that seems a lot of trouble (and cost) to go through for two lenses in the entire M line up. The dedicated R Adapter SL unit will have quite a bit more space to work with since it is both larger diameter and nearly 28mm long to provide correct mount registration.
