The Super-Angulons were multi-coated in the summer of 1978 beginning with the f/5.6 series. This would refer to the large format range I assume but cannot be years out for the 21mm f3.4. That would put that coating change at around 2 809 401 in Leica numbers (the original number quoted would be around 1971). Perhaps only that very last batch of 150 in 1978 were possibly multicoated or maybe they just didn't bother changing for those few?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 41801, "searchterm": "prototype", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['schenider', 'manufacture', 'lens', 'design', 'faq', 'imply', 'coating', 'change', 'later', 'serial', 'faq', 'schneider', 'begin', 'multi', 'coating', 'lense', 'symmar', 'lens', 'multi', 'coat', 'symmar', 'serial', 'number', 'march', 'follow', 'rest', 'focal', 'length', 'complete', 'early', 'super', 'angulons', 'multi', 'coat', 'summer', 'begin', 'series', 'refer', 'large', 'format', 'range', 'assume', 'year', 'coating', 'change', 'leica', 'number', 'original', 'number', 'quote', 'batch', 'possibly', 'multicoate', 'maybe', 'bother', 'change']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.94, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.7754}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": null, "Emotion": null, "temp_list": null, "year": "2015"}], "name": "prototypeL-Forum2015positive"}
