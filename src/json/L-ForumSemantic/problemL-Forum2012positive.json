If we assume the display problem was the coffee mug ring, it's easy to see how that could be down to a quality problem at the vendor; cameras come in from the field with the problem, are correlated with batch number and some or all of the spares stock is found to be in the same batch. Cue \"uh-oh!\". My reading of the situation is that many M8s will not have this problem - Mr Daniel isn't saying how many cameras might be affected - but that if the coffee ring problem does occur, a normal failure occurs or the screen is damaged, the M8 is a write-off. If there are stocks of displays available elsewhere, I would have thought it worthwhile - in the spirit of trying to keep M8s going - to buy them to see whether they work. It makes buying an M8 very tricky. Most likely, the camera will not have a problem but if it does, the value is reduced to whatever allowance Leica will give you over an M9. In theory, a broken M8 could be traded on, for example, eBay as a kind of Discount Voucher, itself at a discount. Sad to say, I don't think M8s will stay above \u00a31000/$1500 for very long and may well be soon worth less than, say, an M6.
