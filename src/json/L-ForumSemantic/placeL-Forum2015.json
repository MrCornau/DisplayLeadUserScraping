Find a place where you find detail at a large (> 1km) distance, in Rotterdam cranes and chemical facturies on a bright day will do fine. Turn the screw of the roller and check if you reach infinity in the finder. The small detail of the cranes/factories will help you to find the setting with the highest contrast. You will need ten minutes before you're done. I use to check with my 50mm lens because the helicoil is 1:1 meaning it is the most simple construction. Wish you success!
