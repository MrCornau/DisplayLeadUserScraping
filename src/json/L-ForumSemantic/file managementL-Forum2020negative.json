When you invoke Silver Efex Pro 2 (SEP2) from LR, the RAW file is automatically converted to TIFF and returned in TIFF format. This means that all appropriate modifications (e.g., highlights, shadows) should be done before invoking SEP2. That is only an issue if you want to use SEP2 standalone. When I need to work on a file in Photoshop, I also need to convert the file to TIFF format .", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 111721, "searchterm": "file management", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['hour', 'ago', 'petermullett', 'sure', 'believe', 'silver', 'efex', 'work', 'raw', 'file', 'jpeg', 'tiffs', 'case', 'early', 'version', 'maybe', 'new', 'different', 'try', 'know', 'invoke', 'silver', 'efex', 'pro', 'raw', 'file', 'automatically', 'convert', 'tiff', 'return', 'tiff', 'format', 'mean', 'appropriate', 'modification', 'highlight', 'shadow', 'invoke', 'issue', 'want', 'use', 'standalone', 'need', 'work', 'file', 'photoshop', 'need', 'convert', 'file', 'tiff', 'format']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.976, 'pos': 0.012, 'compound': -0.008}", "Sentiment": "negative", "TB_score": null, "Emotion": null, "temp_list": null, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 393, "Relevance": 75.82, "content": "Getting hold of good DNG files for the M10M seems to be an issue.
