A little, a lot, not at all? Couple of examples might help. I was in one of the most famous camera shops in Japan (where I live), Map Camera in Shinjuku. Definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in Tokyo, by the way. The basement floor is for Leicas, Hasselblads, medium format, etc. A month or so ago I was browsing there and there was a guy testing out a Leica. I couldn't see precisely which one, but I'm certain it was a digital M, just from the shape. So, however you cut it, not a cheap camera - and Map Camera is not known for generous pricing; if anything it's the opposite. He was holding it up to his eye and looking all Bresson-ish, when the following conversation took place between him and the shop assistant. Man carrying considerably expensive camera and lens combination : \"What is this figure in red here?\" Shop staff, extremely politely : \"That is the shutter speed, Sir\". My conclusion : man with enough cash to buy a modern digital M plus lens doesn't recognize shutter speed when he sees it. Secondly - a few days ago - I was out shooting the remains of the superb autumn foliage we get here. There was another person doing the same thing. Again, I couldn't tell for sure but at a glance it looked very much like another digital M in his hands. The guy was shooting it by holding it out in front of him, arms locked out with the strap around his neck, and contorting his body to look through the rear screen (meaning that it couldn't have been an M8 or M9 / monochrom(e?), so an M240 or newer). Now it could of course have been the case that his rangefinder was out and he had to use the rear screen, but the way he was leaning back, tilting his head and basically doing an olympic gymnastics routine to get the framing where he wanted it, suggested otherwise. I've seen quite a lot of this around here : you don't see that many digital Ms in the wild, but when you do I'd estimate that at least half the users shoot as if they were carrying something like a Sony RX-1. I'm all for people shooting whatever they want, but I have to admit to a bit of eye-rolling at the above two examples; they strike me as giving credence to the notion, held by some, that some Leica users have far more money than sense / photographic talent.
