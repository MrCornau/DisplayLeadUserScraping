In fact, Dr. Leitz is quoted as saying that Berek designed the 135 Hektor for maximum improvement over the previous elmar and specifically for the leica. The Hektor was a much better lens, and said to be better color corrected. It lasted for many years. But the following late 135 f4 Elmar (1960) was even significantly better. Puts, Compendium, shows the Hektor at f11 to be no beter than the late elmar wide open. I found two more 3 digit Elmar early lens. 760--uncoupled, no internal number, but 1990 hand scratched on lens head flange, black rear mount, an original 383--first RF coupled, then later modified for 42mm screw mount cameras, internal serial scratched 590693 which is a IIIf RD so the modifications were likely after 1954. I have seen two 3 digit 135 Elmars with two different compatability numbers engraved . It is possible that an original lens was separated from its matched non-standard camera and the owner had it matched to another camera by shimming the camera flange to match the lens. Reportedly, from May 9, 1931, all lenes and cameras were standardized, but leitz was still not using conventional lens serial numbers. So, until late 1931 or early 1932,some lenses did not have any serial numbers, 3 or 5 digit. 3 digit lenses returned for standardization did not have the 3 digit serial removed, but a small \"o\" was added to the arrow at the base. The standardized model C cameras also had the \"o\" on the body flange. I have not seen an example of a 3 digit lens with \"o\". amd beleive this upgrade to be rare. Perhaps leitz was not frequently upgrading lenses until 1932 when the rangefinder would have driven a bigger demand. Here are my elmars without any serials and the arrow with the \"o\". They were clearly made for the standardized C camera. They do not have any internal camera serial scratched as would be correct and they have the black paint rear flange. --img--  Other unnumbered 135 Elmars I have are rangefinder coupled and also do not have the \"o\". This could be that they were upgraded after Feb 1932 and the lower section shell was changed to accomodate the six rangefinder transfer bar screws and the \"o\" was lost.
