The M60 or M-D satisfies all the true screen-less urges, while the M10 has all the newer features. The M10-D impedes some of them, such as using non-coded lenses and changing setting just becomes torturous as the wifi takes 30 seconds to come up. So it would make sense to get if you have no screen-less Leicas, but if you do, use those for screen-less shooting, truly so, and use the M10 for low-ISO, non-coded lenses, etc. Really, @a.noctilux, I'm afraid there's no reason to have an M-D, M10 (or M10-P), and the M10-D, except for relegating the M-D to the collectible/nostalgic shelf whence you walk it from once a year or so. This is what my Fuji X-Pro2/X100F and Pentax K-3II/ K-1 are doing right now, waiting for a rare walk/niche use (moving targets, once small RAW-shooting single-lens camera travel, etc.). With the M60 I could justify the rarity for non-use and get the M10-D but I just feel M60 is so much true fun I'll have to cancel my BH Photo order for the M10-D placed just before I'd stumbled upon the M60. Sure shots come out blurry or a bit overexposed once in a while just like film used to do years ago and it's totally fun part of the experience. Even the noise at ISO 3200 or higher is a part of the experience, like the film grain. It's hard to imagine having that or M-D and the M10 ever needing the M10-D. Perhaps indeed the most reasonable strategy is waiting for the replacement for M10 itself, and then for its -D, such as the M11-D.

Any information would be very appreciated. Geoff The \"new\" sensor was announced in June 2015 and around October that year they began fitting them. The new sensor required updated firmware which was the early \"tell tale\", there have been updates since to firmware which now works on both Mk1 and Mk2 so that ID marker has gone, new firmware adjusts for either sensor. It is possible to look at the hidden data in the service menu of the M9 AT YOUR OWN RISK (if you alter settings you can be in trouble with functions if you only look and then close no issues)Power on Delete -> up (2x) -> down (4x) -> left (3x) -> right (3x) -> Info Cleared by turning the camera off. Scroll down the display and under Hardware IDs you should see something like: CCD ID 15, CCD Board 2, Control BRD 2, M16CID 0. (my bold) The CCD ID of new sensors is 15 and 16 (thought to be the year but not proven) 5 and 8 and 11 are old sensors, the MM has a different code. All anecdotal and unconfirmed by Leica but owners have dates returned and data accessed, this despite the sometimes vague Leica paperwork which often does not clearly state what was done. Of course a phone call to Leica with the serial number will allow them to disclose the camera repair history. \u200bNote some sellers state \"new sensor fitted\" but they mean the damaged original Mk1 sensor was indeed replaced but until the Mk2 was introduced Leica replaced with just another Mk1 sensor which was prone to the same fault and indeed many have had the sensor replaced twice. Leica said that some M9 sensors could be affected, not that all would be, and never confirmed the conditions that could cause the deterioration. It is entirely possible that an M9 with an original sensor may never develop the problem but IMHO a purchase of am M9 with MK1 sensor should have the replacement cost factored into the price. Note also a camera returned from Leica with a MK2 sensor will also have been thoroughly checked over and meet all specs. Given the number of M9 cameras sold and despite the waiting lists only a fraction of the bodies have had sensors replaced so you can speculate this is because they don't have the problem and never will have, not yet developed the problem but probably will develop it, or have it already but the owners don't notice, or do and clone out the affected areas if only minor. I know that's no help but that is the position.

Long story short the conversion took until the end of March (over 6 months) to be completed to my satisfaction with endless excuses for delays \u2026 and required return for adjustment because initially was returned with the rotatable click-stopped 'L' shaped tripod support at 30\u00ba to the image plane \u2026 rendering it unusable regardless of the tripod support's 'clicked' position . Also, another FD lens sent for conversion (FD 300/4 L ) was returned because the EOS 'chip' (electronic contacts) fell off the first time the lens was coupled to the EOS to SL adapter. I was so disappointed with the conversions I did not use the lens until recently when discovered that it would not work in Aperture priority with EOS extension tubes or EOS extenders \u2026 but have now discovered it will work with tubes and extenders and the Novoflex EOS to SL adapter, provided the camera is used in Manual exposure mode ... whereby the lens' aperture ring &/or the camera's shutter speed are adjusted to ZERO the exposure scale \u2026 no problem for anyone used to using e.g. a Leica M6 .

What amazes me is that you received a reply. What, unfortunately, does not amaze me at all is the reply itself. They describe a behavior without mentioning the exact values for ISO, Aperture and Shutter speed and how they interact but simply say this behavior is \"so gew\u00fcnscht\". The latter raises a question on my part: \"so gew\u00fcnscht\", by whom? Not me, and I cannot really imagine anyone who would want to have the way it is right now. I have a lot of camera's on which I use auto ISO, but not the Q. It is not completely useless in general I guess, but utterly useless for me. As a result, I hardly use the Q in low light situations where I want to be sure shutter speed does not drop below a certain limit that is already low. What use is the OIS if you cannot have this? What is the use of 1/60 when setting a high ISO limit and lower when setting a lower ISO ??? This puzzles me the most... what the **** is the rationale behind this? Like I said I own many camera's, they all have their quirks and misses, but this is more than that, it is a failure. On my list of idiotic issues with firmware, this has a very high position. There is no excuse. On my list of reasons not to recommend the Q to certain types of shooters, this holds a high position also. But: I will now also write them myself, and maybe other readers who agree with you and me should do that too. I do not believe we will get what we want, but at least then we tried. I will post any answers I get here.

My approach is rather different because flash is my last choice when faced with low light. First, explore the higher ISO settings to determine the the highest ISO that you find satisfactory. Set that number as your higher number when using Auto-ISO. If you can access noise-reduction software, you will possibly find you can go even higher. Next, maximise your use of the wider angle lens zoom settings. The widest angle will give you the fastest aperture, which helps in low light. The next step is to consider a small compact lightweight table tripod, such as the excellent Manfrotto Pixie or Pixie Evo. Use of such devices opens up a whole new world of indoor low light possibilities. (You do not need high ISOs when using a tripod, so set a low ISO for maximum quality) Discover the advantages of using delayed action to minimize shake when making an exposure using a tripod. If flash is essential, consider using the built-in flash purely as a trigger for remote flashes carefully positioned in or near your indoor scene. In that way you extend their coverage. I am sure other members will offer more relevant advice regarding flash unit compatibility. Once you have found a solution, try to conceal the fact that you have used flash. The ideal is to preserve the realism of available light, albeit augmented with flash illumination. I hope this helps you.
