No need to sell this wonderful lens. \ufeff The problem stems from the M9 sensor but is corrected in-camera for jpegs if the appropriate lens profile is chosen manually or detected automatically. I agree that one should not blame the 28 Elmarit ASPH alone or in particular. But in reality it is a combination of a lens, the short mount distance of the M cameras, and sensor microlens design and IR filtering. Leica could have designed the Elmarit optics to be more like a massive SLR lens, or the Sony Alpha FE 28mm f/2.0 - twice as long, and 10% fatter - and probably eliminated almost all the \"native\" cyan vignetting. But that is not consistent with the scale of a Leica M camera, and in the case of the Elmarit in particular, a lens that was designed to 1) have the \"size and feel,\" and approximate FoV, of a 35mm on 2) the cropped sensor of the M8 (the lens and camera were introduced simultaneously). 15 years ago, Leica was insisting that it was not possible to make a digital M at all, and technical problems like the cyan vignetting are exactly what they knew they would face. Market forces eventually forced them to address the problem, by a Rube-Goldberg combination of 6-bit coding, IR filtering so \"thin\" that it was only 50% effective, a cropped sensor in the first iteration (M8), extensive in-camera processing to correct the remaining vignetting, and so on. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine#/media/File:Rube_Goldberg's_\"Self-Operating_Napkin\"_(cropped).gif It helps to remember that the M9 sensor silicon is \"last-millenium\" technology - based on the Kodak CCD architecture for, first, medium-format SLR digital-back sensors (c. 2000), and then cut down for use in the Leica DMR back (2005), and then carried over into the M8 (late 2006), and then \"de-cropped\" for 24x36 in the M9 (2009). The \"new\" M9 sensor changed virtually nothing - except for using a less corrosion-prone cover glass type. 3 hours ago, schattenundlicht said: \u2022 This is a case in point, that \u201eraw\u201c files are far from being truly unprocessed sensor data \ufeff As has been well-known (at least by anyone paying attention) since - oh - about 2003. 3 hours ago, schattenundlicht said: \u2022 The correction of the DNGs is only part(i)al, however. Yes, and for a very simple reason. To remove the cyan tint, the red channel is pushed or amplified. On a curved gradient from zero amount in the center to a larger amount (up to 2 stops with an older 21) in the corners. Which means more noise in the red channel. One of the very first things I noticed trying my 21 pre-ASPH on an M9 on the day of introduction (9/9/09) was how many red noise speckles appeared near the edges as the red luminance was cranked up to counteract the cyan tint. Leica does a \"balancing act,\" varying the amount or \"curve\" of correction with the ISO in use. 3 hours ago, schattenundlicht said: \u2022 I find it disappointing to use different M bodies (e.g. M9 & M10) at the same ti\ufeffme on the same location and get such highly inconsistent color rendering. Just a question of perspective. Kodachrome II did not render color the same as original Kodachrome, nor did Kodachrome 25 render color the same as KII. Ektachrome 100 in 2005 (and probably in 2018) rendered color differently than E100 (1980). Velvia 50 renders very differently than Fujichrome 50 RF (1980s) - and \"Velvia\" film simulation in a Fuji digital is not really the same as Velvia itself.

The service department tested the camera and returned the camera to me declaring the camera performed within specifications. They enclosed a CD with copies of their test results.
