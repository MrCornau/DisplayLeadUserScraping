Promoting the spending of thousands of dollars on a new camera based on a bit more headroom drops my jaw, if you don't see the irony when you are a beta tester for Leica then there is no hope for anybody listening to you. Sure some people will follow the scent, but the M10R is even more temporary and even more pointless for the majority of photographers than most of Leica's offerings in recent times. If this was a specialist discussion about theatre photography or similar I could imagine the extra headroom of an M10R may be a vital element, but for 99% of Leica photographers on this forum it won't make any difference at all other than the bank balance, even if they pixel peep. Thousands of dollars for that? It is symptomatic across the industry that the old camera is now not fit for purpose because hey, you may just meet those situations you never even considered or complained about before. Big revolutions have gone on continually in photography for near on 180 years and only in recent times has the previous work of photographers been cast in doubt, largely driven by marketing and the next best sensor. Now is the age when a tiny improvement costs thousands and appeals to people who want to tick the box to say they are riding the crest of the wave. Do they make better photographs, no, they make the same photograph time after time, every Summer holiday and every Christmas. That is the sink hole of new cameras unless they offer a proper step change, and that is the hole reviewers dig for their fans. I see it this way. Who cares if it's thousands of dollars for an incremental upgrade? The decision to spend or not spend the money is up to the individual who's money it is. Not to an audience with no knowledge of the purchaser. I am not the richest person on these forums. Nor am I the poorest. But I will spend my money how I please and no one else gets a say in what I do with my hard earned cash. So what if I like shiny new things and I'm an awful photographer. It's my money and I'm not hurting anyone. Discretionary purchases don't have to make sense. They almost never do. That's daft and a good way to kill an economy. People buy a Mercedes instead of a Toyota or a Tag instead of a Casio. A big TV or a new set of golf clubs. I know people who spend more on a road bike than an M10 just to save 500 grams. Won't make them faster but it makes them feel good. So why not? There's a thing called *pride of ownership*. People like shiny stuff. I don't buy my girl a piece of jewelry (actually in her case a pair of shoes....) because is functions better than the piece she already has. If we were being purely logical the Leica wouldn't exist. We'd still be shooting Canikony! We're so far from logical purchases it's laughable so arguing that upgrading from a M10 to M10R because you don't need it is laughable in itself. I'm sure you wanted to say \"I don't see the point and I'm not going to spend my money on what I see as an incremental upgrade\". Great. But that's not how it reads. It reads that you think we're idiots for upgrading and wasting or money on something that's not going to make any difference to our photography. Which is (a) wrong and (b) the whole point of Leica to begin with. Most of us work stupidly hard for our money and we really don't like being told how to spend it or that we're stupid for doing it. We're not. We get enough people telling us we're stupid for buying Leica from outside the Leica community that we really don't appreciate it from within.

In Australia, the trade in is fairly costly. I could potentially trade my M10 and the 16-18-21 WATE (used twice in the last 2 years) for the M10R, I'll still need to top up 3k so its a rather substantial investment. Ive hopped onto the SL2 earlier in the year, while it opened up new opportunities like long lenses for birds and macro for floral. I cant help but feel its not giving me the same experience I got from the M. I also find it too heavy as a system to carry for long hikes and trips and I really miss the M at those times. The reason I really want to upgrade are: 1) Higher Dynamic Range (from reviews and photo samples) 2) Better highlight recovery (from reviews and photo samples) 3) Ability to crop with higher MP so I could travel with just a 35mm and maybe a 90mm The reasons against it: 1) Tie up a whole bunch of funds (I can only afford to this once really so if anything new comes along I wont be able to afford it) 2) About the same sensor MP count as SL2 3) M11 might have ibis.... or what if CL2 comes along with EVF and ibis and light Oh man....what should I do..... Time heals even the most severe GAS ! I don't think I've read many comments that don't praise the M10-R, highly. Many of us already know the M10 form factor is a beauty to behold and to use and now with an even better sensor that ups the DR and highlight recovery in the -R...all very compelling for those of us that appreciate such things. But when push comes to shove aka the M10-R price tag, I do wonder what many who do take the plunge is doing with the slightly better DR, Highlight Recovery, more pixels and and as some claim, better skin tones? Surely these nuanced improvements can't be wasted on just posting severely downsized jpeg files to the forum or to show friends and family on our smart phones or social media. Trust me, I do love to pixel peep all the MPs and marvel at all the detail I can snatch out of the shadows in post, but then what?

But I have my workarounds for this, so I am fine here, too. Regarding resolution, I am using also the 36 MP FF Sony A7R in parallel - one reason why I bought the M-E 240 is ideal performance with wide and ultra-wide lenses which gave me issues on the A7R. Even the M-E 240 is only 24 MP, photos taken with wide M and LTM lenses are better in resolution especially in the corners of the frame than on the higher resolution A7R camera. But yes, there is a difference in resolution when looking at image details in 200% on a large screen. But the difference is not huge either. I can print 20x30\" with photos from both cameras easily. I admit that the M10R is my \"dream\" camera, but I cannot justify its severe price tag. Getting the M-E 240 for less than 1/4th of the price of a new M10R was a no-brainer for me. I would benefit in my style of photography from the higher resolution and DR of the M10R but honestly a camera never holds me back from getting the shot done. The M 240 series is pretty good in pushing shadows already just has the limitation in highlight DR. I simply use exposure bracketing here when this is needed and use HDR in a realistic way to post-process these digital files. I don't expect M10 series prices to drop significantly to the level where I would consider buying for several years to come.

The Linear DNG format can hold more non-image data. I do not know why Leica made this choice. I ended up writing my own DNG processing code, including converting the color files from the M8 and M9 to monochrome and writing them in the \"LinearRaw\" format. This requires demosaicing the image, eliminating DNG Tags for the color filter array and associated fields, changing the value of Tag 6 from 32803 to 34892. Both file formats can use the same tags for storing information. They are both in the same DNG spec, just different values for Tag 6 \"photometric interpretation\" and then filling in the other tags as they make sense. PHOTOMETRIC INTERPRETATION Page 20 of the DNG 1.4.0 spec.https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/products/photoshop/pdfs/dng_spec_1.4.0.0.pdf The DNG Spec uses Tag 6 to set the DNG format. The Specification uses two terms for the Raw IFD, A value of 32803(dec), '8023'x (hex), specifies CFA (Color Filter Array) A value of 34892(dec), '884C'x (hex), specifies LinearRaw. CFA is used for the M9, LinearRaw is used for the M Monochrom. The CFA format has Tag settings to demosaic the image, typically using a Bayer filter pattern. More patterns are available.

They all have some issues here and there. The first one has a loose lens mount, though I got it fixed by Leica later, it took months. Besides, its shutter release button is still not the smoothest. The bottom plate of the second M-A has a lot of play and makes an annoying cracking sound when you hold the camera to change lens. The third one has the same issue with the bottom plate, plus a big dust specs in the brand new view finder, and the frame counter doesn't reset. That's why I returned it and exchanged for the fourth one, which I think I will keep it despite the extra effort to reset the frame counter, and its release button is a bit tight. I still like the M-A, its viewfinder is really bright and enjoyable, although I wish it can have a 0.9x version for 50mm lenses (without extra magnifier), and that's why I'm getting a second one.

The results are different, in that they vary by aperture (lower contrast wide-open, peak contrast at middle apertures). It is improbable that Panasonic (and every other major brand) does not do this. They also correct for geometric distortion, colour fringing, etc. They do correct for distortion and vignetting (Leica, Panasonic, and virtually everyone else), but that is via op codes that are tagged to the file so that image processing software after the fact can make corrections. It\u2019s not done in-camera to raw files at 10+ frames per second. Heck, the color fringing correction he alleges isn\u2019t even possible in a raw file since debayer hasn\u2019t occurred yet. All one can do, and all ano of them DO do, is tag the files. And I saw nothing in Irwin\u2019s post even speculating that the camera is \u201cwatching\u201d for resolution charts in the images so it can apply extra sharpening (which you mentioned previously). As far as resolutions being different on previous generations of cameras...

I am indeed very fortunate, no argument there. But, for me, the 'cron APO lenses where the whole point of buying into the L mount in the first place. I wouldn't have bought into the system otherwise. These lens are indeed as expensive as they are spectacular, but they serve as the core of a system I expect to shoot with for many, many years. Bodies come and go, but assuming you don't become disenchanted with the system, good glass will be with you over the very long haul. Those years takes a bit of the sting out of the price tag after a while. But far more important, I tend to wind up shooting thousands of frames a year with optics I love, as opposed to a few hundred with those I don't. The cost per shot tilts dramatically, becoming pennies a capture over the lifetime of the lens. In the end, an expensive optic you use is a far better value proposition than a cheaper one you don't. After 10 months with the 75mm, half a year with the 35, I've shot roughly 8000 frames between the two. By year's end I'll be under a $1 a capture for the pair. That doesn't alter the entry fee of course, but usage does speak to the wisdom or foolishness of having ponied up in the first place. When it comes to photographic gear, there are easily as many paths to misery as there are happiness. The less enjoyable ones have taught me over time that glass selection is key. I avoided the L until the intro of the alliance, as there simply was no clear path forward early on unless one committed to zooms, which, as an M shooter, I was unprepared to do. I entered, once I was convinced that a satisfying set of optics could be assembled over time. The crucial decision became whether to build around the 35/75 pairing, versus 50/90. Everything else would follow from that. In my case, the deciding factor came down to complimenting the glass I had available on my M, not merely from a focal length POV, but a character one as well. Certainly your calculations will be different. But given you're already in the L fold and assuming you've committed to it long term, I'd take a deep breadth and consider where you'd like to be in a couple of years.
