While being in the spot removal tool hit \"T\" which will display a tool bar at the bottom where you have another nifty tool to display an inverted contrasty mask which can be adjusted with a slider. This makes finding certain \"hidden\" dust spots very easy. You can do your dust spotting in one of your photographs that makes this very easy (a blank wall, shot at f16 or the bright sky) and then copy over the dust spotting information from one photograph to a bulk of photographs. Easy: select all photographs, you want to apply the dust spotting information in the library grid view (or in any module that shows you the film roll at the bottom of the screen). Make sure the one photo which does have your dust spotting already applied is the selected photo of the entire bulk. Now go to the development module (hit \"D\" on your keyboard) and click the \"sync\" button in your development tool ribbon on the very bottom right of the screen (it is the left button of the two buttons). A pop up menu will be displayed where you can select what settings from your selected master photo you wish to sync - you want to select only the dust spotting option, if that is what you want to apply to all selected photographs in the group from your master photograph in focus. After applying, let Lightroom calculate new 1:1 previews of the group of photos and quickly check them all if any of the dust spots have ill effects (easiest to do in the development module, while pressing activating \"Q\" and deactivating \"Q\" as necessary to see the dust spots) Easy photographs are those of dust in the sky - Lightroom will often simply correct them easily. More difficult ones are those with irregular structures (hair, grass, etc \u2026) or regular structures with repeating patterns (like a panning shot at very slow shutter speeds or architecture shots) - Lightroom will often not properly realize the patterns and will place a wrong correction which is easily spotted and has to be adjusted manually. Best practice is to clean the sensor once Lightroom dust spotting becomes to tedious. BTW - if you run also Adobe Photoshop and work with tiff files, a faster way to dust spot is to use a selection tool (I prefer the free form selection tool), multi select all dust spots in an area and then \"shift +F5\" and use the \"fill content-aware\" option to remove dust spots. This is how I spot my film scans for dust, water spots and scratches and it is both much, much faster than Lightroom's spotting tool and does not slow the computer down as much as a photograph with lots of dust spots in Lightroom (as it is not non-destructive as Lightroom, but will correct the image per pixel immediately). Happy dust spotting!
