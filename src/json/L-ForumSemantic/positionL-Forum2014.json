The display of the M9/M9-P is a different display and is sourced from another manufacturer and is therefore not affected. For the M9 as for all our products, we are taking measures that we are able to service the camera for a period of at least ten years after production will stop. In the case that (especially electronic-) parts are no longer available, we will offer an upgrade program.

Pity you did not connect with the XV. Many of the points raised are valid. In particular, point # 1 where you mention that the DNG files are overexposed - this has been my observation too. Yet I have not seen a single other user mention this. I therefore wonder if this is the normal situation with all XV's, or do only some XV's like yours and mine exhibit this? Would other XV users please share your experience on this issue? I do not find overexposure a problem on the X Vario because I always by default tend to shoot at -0.3 as I do on every camera I use. I think it is a straight forward work around on a camera that tends to overexpose. I do agree on point 4 on the position of the white wheel which I sometimes catch and activate the functionality associated with it when it is not required. I think the image quality is much better when imported into Lightroom than it appears from the camera. The quality appears to be similar to my Ricoh GXR with A12 mount, though images appear much sharper from the Ricoh's camera display; the Ricoh is much more responsive than the X Vario though it does not handle noise as well.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/233557-why-im-returning-the-x-vario/?tab=comments#comment-2666014", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "@ allamande, thanks for the post. pity you did not connect with the xv. many of the points raised are valid. in particular, point # 1 where you mention that the dng files are overexposed - this has been my observation too. yet i have not seen a single other user mention this. i therefore wonder if this is the normal situation with all xv's, or do only some xv's like yours and mine exhibit this? would other xv users please share your experience on this issue? i do not find overexposure a problem on the x vario because i always by default tend to shoot at -0.3 as i do on every camera i use. i think it is a straight forward work around on a camera that tends to overexpose. i do agree on point 4 on the -----> position !!!  of the white wheel which i sometimes catch and activate the functionality associated with it when it is not required. i think the image quality is much better when imported into lightroom than it appears from the camera. the quality appears to be similar to my ricoh gxr with a12 mount, though images appear much sharper from the ricoh's camera display; the ricoh is much more responsive than the x vario though it does not handle noise as well.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 13922, "year": "2014"}], "name": "positionL-Forum2014"}
