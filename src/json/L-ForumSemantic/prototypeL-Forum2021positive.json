So the collapsible (11631) seems to be out of production at this time. The collapsible already wasn\u2018t listed in a brochure \u201eLeica-Objektive\u201c from I/62, which still had the LTM rigid version. So it seems that the collapsible went out of production in 1961, whilst the LTM version was still made in 1962 and perhaps the first months of 1963. Though dealing with Leica items always means coping with inconsistencies: a pricelist (10-5a) from Jan. 65 still lists the collapsible version 11631M for 296,-DM, the rigid version 11830R was 258,-DM. The latter must have been the 3-elements, as they didn\u2019t give this new version a new number. Perhaps the entries in pricelists can be explained by the fact that quite a lot of copies were still on the shelves in Wetzlar or at the dealers, so even when an item was not produced any more you could regularly buy it. P.S.: even the pricelist 10-5q from Febr. 1966 still has the entry for the collapsible for 296,-DM. Really interesting indeed. It seems there's material for an interesting article there.

So the collapsible (11631) seems to be out of production at this time. The collapsible already wasn\u2018t listed in a brochure \u201eLeica-Objektive\u201c from I/62, which still had the LTM rigid version. So it seems that the collapsible went out of production in 1961, whilst the LTM version was still made in 1962 and perhaps the first months of 1963. Though dealing with Leica items always means coping with inconsistencies: a pricelist (10-5a) from Jan. 65 still lists the collapsible version 11631M for 296,-DM, the rigid version 11830R was 258,-DM.

Apparently 35/2.8 lenses with three crowns all were shipped together on May 25th 1960 to Brandt Stockholm, with shipping number 80856 (80856 instead of 80866!). Upon checking of some details with Leica AG some of the delivery dates for the serial numbers above did not match the delivery date nor the location, i.e. were delivered to Germany or Asia (HK) instead later and have nothing to do with Swedish Military. Maybe someone from the community and/or well respected collectors frequenting this forum can help to compile and perfect the list or shed some further light on the matter? Thank you in advance.

I had an older chrome Elmarit and now often use my black version from 1966. Isn't this a Mandler design?

Interestingly they were recorded in the administration with Schneider serial numbers, whereas in fact they must have been given Leitz serial numbers. Production in 1965 went as follows: 22 june 1965 600 Elmarit 30 july 1965 100 5 oct. 1965 284 (iun the same period production of the Super-Angulon seems to have begun for Leitz) 6 oct. 1965 500 12 oct 1965 1000 13 oct 1965 300 22 oct. 1965 200 3 nov. 1965 246 So in 1965 a total of 4224 Elmarits were produced by Schneider for Leitz. As remarks always Leica M was mentioned, and 'Sondern.', which means special number. I assume the Leitz serial numbers were meant by that.

It is a so-called Version II (see link title in post #2), but also (if the wiki is correct) black anodized, which gives it a catalog number of 11870. Also, if you don't already know, Leica pre-assigned S/Ns in blocks: \"The next 1000 35mm Summiluxes we make will get numbers 3281401 through 3282400\" That block of numbers was not used up and replaced with a new block until 1985, so it may be a 1983 or a 1984 (or even possibly an early 1985) lens. (In other words, Leica serial numbers sometimes have to be read like animal entrails ) But in any case a version II (2), and a 11870 black lens. Yes, thank you...that's what I meant, catalog number 11870.
