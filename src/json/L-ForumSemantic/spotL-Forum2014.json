The issue is linked with corrosion effects on the cover glass of the CCD sensor in Leica M9, M9-P, M Monochrom and M-E cameras. They manifest themselves as marks on images captured at smaller apertures (f/5.6-22). The new Leica M (Type 240) with the CMOS sensor is not affected by this problem. We are truly sorry for the inconvenience encountered and we have set up the following scheme for servicing the sensors of the products affected. Please be aware that a contact-free cleaning of the sensor is essential in preventing the issue. \u2022 Customer care will perform sensor cleaning free of charge by prior arrangement. \u2022 In the case of damage as a result of corrosion, the sensor will be replaced free of charge up to three years following the date of purchase. Leica Camera AG will cover the full costs of replacement, amounting to 1,800 euros plus applicable VAT. This does not apply to sensors damaged by scratching or breakage of the sensor glass. \u2022 In the fourth and fifth year following the date of purchase, sensors damaged by the corrosion effects described will be replaced for a fixed charge of 600 euros plus applicable VAT. Leica Camera AG will cover the remaining costs of 1,200 euros. \u2022 In the sixth and seventh year following the date of purchase, sensor replacement will be offered at a fixed charge of 1,200 euros plus applicable VAT. Leica Camera AG will cover the remaining costs of 600 euros. \u2022 For the eighth and more years following the date of purchase, sensor replacement will be offered at a fixed charge of 1,500 euros plus applicable VAT. Leica Camera AG will cover the remaining costs of 300 euros. \u2022 The prices stated apply for direct shipment of the camera to Leica Customer Care in Wetzlar or the Customer Care department of a national distributor. Additional costs may arise when the camera is sent to Leica through a dealer. \u2022 Mandatory warranty conditions will apply after customers have taken advantage of the extended goodwill arrangement. \u2022 As longer waiting times may otherwise occur, the camera should only be sent to Customer Care after prior arrangement. \u2022 We will continue watching this thread so you are welcome to react here. ^JJ with Leica-camera In my view and from my long experience with cleaning M8, M9 and M240 cameras, non-contact cleaning just does not begin work for cleaning sensors. Canned air cleaners, apart from squirting a dangerous and highly inflammable mix of propane and butane into the camera, only blow the dust around into the shutter mechanism and the electronics of the camera and do not remove it. The so-called Rocket type bulb blowers, which I do use, are only minimally effective. They also do not begin to remove the greasy spots, which are often to be found adhering to the sensor cover glass. If you are saying that contact cleaning methods invalidate the implied 6 year EU warranty, you are in effect saying that all interchangeable lens Leica digital cameras are now unusable in the long term. If this is really the case, you make a very good reason for a refund of the purchase price of all digital M Leica cameras and all the lenses bought to fit them. I am amazed that anyone has seen fit to thank you for your post and are not like me, up in arms. I am totally astounded by the position Leica is taking on this. It is certainly not to the benefit of customers. Wet cleaning of sensors is the industry standard for removing smears, condensation and grease spots on interchangeable lens digital cameras. It strikes me that this is a backside covering approach by Leica because the costs of warranty replacement of inadequately sealed/incorrectly made sensors or cover glasses are starting to mount up. I hope you realise that I am extremely unhappy about this, as a loyal Leica customer of now close to 50 years and as an owner of 10 Leica cameras and dozens of lenses.

I don't have a lens-set based mainly on trying to carry a good spaced out group of focal lengths. Or, which are optically the fastest or most corrected lenses in each focal length. My choices are based on how I want to create a scene through a particular lens, mostly based on the focal lengths I like to work with and \"see\" in. To a lesser degree other particular lens characteristics play a role in why I like a lens. But, mostly I want lenses that allow me to approach a scene with the thought of completely controlling and manipulating the way the viewer is going to see and experience the image. I am more the active \"deliberate moment\" photographer working everything in my control, as apposed to the passive photographer waiting for the decisive moment to happen along through my viewfinder. Everyone has to actively decide how they are going to use every lens they bring along in their own travel kit themselves. These are my travel choices. WATE - I just love to see in the wide 16mm. Not because I want more in the scene as much as I like the near-far perspective the wides create. 21mm seems more normal in comparison to me, but is mostly useful to me when 16 needs cropping. The WATE allows me to see and create the placement of the camera (perspective) and use the zoom from 16-21 to crop the picture, I see in 16mm. Just how I approach the complex ultra-wide view. 28 Summicron - All around way I like to compose and create layered scenes with interest. Also, can be used to exaggerate perspective. f4.0 is normal for me and I tend to go to f16 more than I would f2.0 50 Summilux - Just all around best 50mm lens ever made. Tend to shoot at f4.0 and the transition to OOF is sooo smooth. Will stop down, but I'm not a bokeh fan for near shots as they always tend to just look like everything is out of focus, to me. Mid range shots are nice wide open, though. Great travel night lens with 1.4 available and creating background OOF lights. 90 Macro Elmar - Recognized as having the best optics of the 90mm Leica lenses at near for portraiture, for example. Top quality for distance landscape. Insanely compact and gives macro if you need. I'd never consider carrying the 90 APO or even the other large 90mm lenses for travel. Shot mostly in daylight I don't find a need for f2.0. Best long travel 90mm lens in my opinion. Not used enough by me, though. (I have the 35mm 1.4 FLE and it is a superior image quality choice, but it can be very normal and without drama and interest, for me. Harder to work into interesting perspectives, for me. Bigger and heavier than the excellent 28 Summicron the 35 FLE is too close to the 50mm and 28mm with nothing unique enough to garner a spot in the travel kit. And, I dislike the background bokeh of specular highlights.)

I took the liberty to download and examine them. In the jpeg file the CA on the boy's leg is visible but quite unnoticeable as it blends with the pants color. But the same CA in the same color is visible either in the poles at the right behind the flag and in the arch holding the Ola Vista sign. As a Linux user I grind DNGs in RAWTherapee which has no camera dedicated profile, so it's easy for me to spot shortcomings if any as they're not covered by the software. No matter applying distortion correction or not, there's a faint trace of CA in the boy's leg. Only this time is more visible as the fringing is purple/magenta and not blue as in the jpeg. I also see CA in the poles at the right and in the top of the flag pole. In both places fringing is green on the right and magenta on the left, God only knows why. In RAWTherapee intensity of CA depends much on applied color presets. Those which pump the color to give more pop tend to exacerbate the problem. Regrettably enough (for me) RAWTherapee filters to defringe and to remove CA apparently can nothing against the fringing I usually find in T's DNGs. Strangely enough, the same correction filters are very effective on the DNG files produced by my X2 which shares the same sensor of the T.

Does not look good for our X113... -TK As i am from Germany, i\u00b4m not a native english speaker. But I try to do my best: I owned both X1 and X2 and I was very satisfied with the pictures. Now I own the X for a couple of days and don\u00b4t see any worse difference to X1/2. Only improvements in every case. That the full size sensor of RX1 is better than many other cameras is no secret. But if I look to the comparison and see that even the LX100 and LX7 look sharper or equal then I feel that there is something wrong with the X results. Its the same good old APSC Sensor and the lens have to be better at f5,6 than the zoom lenses of the LX100 and the LX7. So I had to ask myself some questions: Is dprwview independent, what the finance basic? Are requirements for tests the same? Could it be possible that pictures were interchanged? What were the basic presets of the cameras? Which autofocus preset was used (Spot or 11-field)? Is it a scientific like comparison and is it under a quality management? Was the X and firmware from latest production or from pilot production? Is it ok to take a standard Raw-development workflow for every camera? There are many possibilities to influence the results with that. It would be great to see in that comparison also ooc-jpeg and not jpeg from the Raw development. So you see that the results don\u00b4t have to be compareable. There are too many possibilities for mistakes.
