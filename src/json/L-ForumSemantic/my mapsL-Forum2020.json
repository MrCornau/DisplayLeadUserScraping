The camera takes this GPS data and writes it into the RAW file at the point of capture (ie it's not added to the file afterwards). It works maybe 90% of the time, but occasionally the phone and the camera will disconnect from each other, so you end up performing a silly dance where you turn off the camera, turn it back on, turn off your phone's bluetooth, back on again, etc. Annoying. On my Leica Q2, I was hoping for a similar feature via the Fotos app, but as many have found out, it only works for photos that are taken using the app. When they eventually add the feature to cover all photos taken with the camera, my hope is that it doesn't require a direct WiFi connection to the camera and just work over bluetooth. In the interim, I have downloaded an iPhone app named Geotag Photos Pro 2 (I believe there is an Android version too). It's great and it does the job beautifully. First you need to set the time on your camera as closely as possible to your phone - on the iPhone you can watch the second hand on the clock icon to help with this. You should only need to do this once. Then in the Geotag app you create a \u2018trip\u2019 when you're ready to use your camera. It records your location at preset (adjustable) intervals, then when you're done for the day you simply end the trip on the app and it exports a GPX file to the cloud service of your choice.

For the Lightroom route, you simply go to the 'Map' view in Lightroom, click the 'GPS Tracklogs' button at the bottom (looks like a zig-zag, next to the lock icon), select 'Load Tracklog' and open the GPX file from your 'trip' which should be on your cloud drive. From the same popup menu, click 'Select photos on Tracklog' then 'Auto-tag X Selected Photos' to add the GPS data to each photo.

The SL's built-in GPS is better, but neither is as accurate or as quick to find its location under the usual partly-obscured conditions as any of my phones or tablets, even when they lack a SIM card. So I'm in favor of letting a phone do the geolocation. It works pretty well on my Lumix S1R with Panasonic's equivalent of Fotos, and only uses the BTLE link to minimize battery drain. But Fotos isn't there yet. Lumix Synch solves the problems of harmonizing control inputs from the remote app with those made at the camera by only letting one side (camera or tablet) be in control. And the Lumix app can adjust quite a few more control settings from its remote app. Leica hasn't let very much be controlled (even on the M10-D, which can do more than you can see with the other models). You can set continuous shooting or bracketing in drive mode using Fotos, but neither of them works in Remote. I can understand continuous shooting not working, since there isn't both a button down and button up function on the Fotos shutter button, but why can't Fotos trigger a bracket of three shots? Of course, Fotos can't do video without solving this problem, probably by making the shutter button mean Start when the video is not running, and Stop when it is, but I'm not willing to spend $50 to find out. Also, how will Fotos handle the multishot HiRes mode that we have been promised if it can't trigger a bracket? Not having the Fotos App insist on installing its own silly settings instead of leaving the camera in the state it was in has been suggested and Leica seems to understand that is desirable. But they also aren't there yet. The most recent iOS and Android versions of Fotos (with different version numbers) deal with this differently, so maybe they are working on it. There are two parts to this -- do you want Fotos to start remote operation in its standard state, which you can change by setting aperture, ISO and shutter to your preferences, but leave the camera as it found it when you exit? Or would you rather that Fotos uses the camera in the state it finds it, and leaves it in whatever state you put it into. Or some of both? My preference would be for the camera to start out the way I set it, and to return to that state when Fotos disconnects.
