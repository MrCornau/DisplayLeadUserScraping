I have a very beautiful M10P sitting here at my table for the last day. I\u2019m either keeping it or returning it along with another wad of money for an M10R. My last digital M was an M9 that I sold 6+ years ago, and to be truthful, I never got on very good with it. Terrible high iso performance, the shutter was anything but discreet and lack of live view is what finally made me give it up as mirrorless cameras came of age with CMOS sensors and high resolution EVF\u2019s. I tried to make my M lenses work on that infernal Sony A7r and A7r2, but never to my satisfaction. I just couldn\u2019t accept smearing. So I sold all but my 35 and 50 summicrons and put them aside with my M6 (also 35 years old) that I couldn\u2019t bear to part with for sentimental reasons. Turns out the Sony\u2019s output is really nice but every time I had to dive into a menu, I wanted to poke my eyes out, searching for some cool feature that was for some reason not working because some other setting change made that unavailable, well I had enough and got rid of it. Then some time with the MF Fujis including the GFX 100, but turns out it was more an exercise in chasing ultimate image quality while ignoring my unwillingness to actually haul that stuff around on a regular basis. Sold it all replacing it with a relatively more diminutive Hasselblad 907x, although still not an everyday driver...In the meantime I put together a Leica CL digital kit for actually carry about and practical family and family vacation photography. I really use the hell out of that kit, pandemic notwithstanding. Bought an M-L adapter for the M lenses on the CL, used it a few times but really just used the very remarkable 18-56 zoom that came with the CL. A Q2 was rationalized and added for low light indoor uses.\ud83d\ude00 Then I decided to start scanning my analog archive with a pre-owned Panasonic S1r (for the pixel shift multi shot function) and a Sigma macro. It is light years ahead of flatbed scanning and works so well I started putting film in my film cameras again, including the M6. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how pleased I am to have meaningful access to almost 30 years of negatives and slides to print on modern inkjets. I decide upon the S1r for scanning because in the back of my mind I was aware that I could put all my CL lenses (L mount) on the S1r and then have IBIS capability and 20 megapixels available\u2014if I wanted. Then took out the M-L adapter and put my 35 and 50 on the S1r. Wow! 47 megapixel of niceness and none of the edge smearing that I saw on the Sonys (2 paragraphs back), not perfect on the 35 but real darn close. Focus peaking worked great. But it\u2019s still more camera than I will carry around. For a moment I regretted not jumping right to the SL2 which has the clean interface I know from the Q2 and CL, but the S1r pre-owned was about $2k and an SL2 was going to be well over $5k and I wasn\u2019t convinced I would still carry it regular. I just can\u2019t picture myself buying Leica SL lenses, not because of the cost, but because of the size. No how, no way. But my appetite has been whetted to use my diminutive M lenses on a camera I will carry. And the sour taste of the M9 is gone and while most of my time here on the L-forum has been focused on Q and CL cameras I have been aware that the digital rangefinder has really matured. So I bought an M10-P. It is slim and beautiful, and oh, that shutter, what a change from M9 days! I was a bit concerned about how I would get along with the rangefinder (focus accuracy) since eyeglasses became a part of my wardrobe. I know that digital is more demanding of focus than film. It\u2019s going quite well, performance checking focus accuracy on the live view and picture review is very instructive. The fluid motion of focus and shutter release has returned helped out by setting 1/4f in auto. IBIS or high iso performance seem to serve the same function and now we have high iso performance, it places this camera in a different league of usability over film or the old M9. I\u2019ve also found that I can frame, focus and shoot (at least indoors) using solely the rear screen quite well. That\u2019s mostly how I use my Q2 indoors also. I am going to the Leica store tomorrow to pick up a Visolflex 020. I know some people swear by it, others say it sits in their bag unused. I get the feeling it is what will make the M useable, for me, close focusing (or critical focusing?) outdoors. The only real decision is do I exchange the M10P for the M10R? On the one hand, I am totally happy with the 24 megapixels of the CL for family photos and the Q2\u2019s 47mp is nice (especially cropping)but not a must have (for the family photos), on the other hand the M lenses on the S1r really do shine with all those megapixels (except maybe near the edge) and I am quite happy with the 50 mp Hasselblad and starting to think that 40-50 mp might be my sweet spot. I think I know what I am going to do. There is a part of me that thinks keeping the M10P might be false economy, or is it keeping a camera that is everything the M10R is, save a few megapixels? Sigh...

Sigh... Great posts. I feel your pain, I feel your passion. Beware of the extra efforts it will take you to get sharp results with the M10R, it requires better technique, or faster shutter speeds. I returned mine for an M10P, accepting a 3K loss in the process. Also, I don't want to add more problems on your plate, but I have heard early impressions from A1 users that M lenses are performing quite excellent on it. I have one on the side at my local retailer, might pick it up next week to try it. It might solve many of the things you didn't use to like. New menus, 50MP at 30fps (which means for fast action subject you could stay pressed on the shutter while slowly turning your focus ring from left to right or right to left, and choose which one has the sharpest focus in post among 60 shots \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d), extreme low light performance, new colour science which is supposed to be highly improved according to Gerald Undone... essentially the perfect hybrid camera, that can do it all, it a package half the size of the SL2, and very close to the Q2..... Let's see... P.S. I remind you that a few month ago I did a side by side between the M10R and the A7SIII with M lenses, and no one here could tell which was which. In the instance that there was a difference, the Sony was preferred in 90% of the situations in the blind test. So one could argue that the compact A1 could do everything (and more) than all the cameras you've mentioned in your post together. Only problem, its not a Leica.

Sigh... My two cents (or one) after moving from the M10P to the M10R is that if you will be using the M for general family snaps indoor, never on tripod, and simply for fun then I would stick with the M10P. At first I argued against all of the shutter speed talk of needing high speed for the M10R but after many months of use I have to admit that it truly is a challenge and I keep around 120-200 minimum and even that can be challenging. But, the image quality is noticeably better with the M10R which is the only reason I haven\u2019t gone back to the M10P. I can see why it would be a hard decision.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/312268-m10-p-or-m10r/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-4146015", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "archive", "selectorShort": "archive", "MarkedSent": "19 minutes ago, soarfm said: sigh, well here i am struggling with the same decision. i have a very beautiful m10p sitting here at my table for the last day. i\u2019m either keeping it or returning it along with another wad of money for an m10r. my last digital m was an m9 that i sold 6+ years ago, and to be truthful, i never got on very good with it. terrible high iso performance, the shutter was anything but discreet and lack of live view is what finally made me give it up as mirrorless cameras came of age with cmos sensors and high resolution evf\u2019s. i tried to make my m lenses work on that infernal sony a7r and a7r2, but never to my satisfaction. i just couldn\u2019t accept smearing. so i sold all but my 35 and 50 summicrons and put them aside with my m6 (also 35 years old) that i couldn\u2019t bear to part with for sentimental reasons. turns out the sony\u2019s output is really nice but every time i had to dive into a menu, i wanted to poke my eyes out, searching for some cool feature that was for some reason not working because some other setting change made that unavailable, well i had enough and got rid of it. then some time with the mf fujis including the gfx 100, but turns out it was more an exercise in chasing ultimate image quality while ignoring my unwillingness to actually haul that stuff around on a regular basis. sold it all replacing it with a relatively more diminutive hasselblad 907x, although still not an everyday driver...in the meantime i put together a leica cl digital kit for actually carry about and practical family and family vacation photography. i really use the hell out of that kit, pandemic notwithstanding. bought an m-l adapter for the m lenses on the cl, used it a few times but really just used the very remarkable 18-56 zoom that came with the cl. a q2 was rationalized and added for low light indoor uses.\ud83d\ude00 then i decided to start scanning my analog -----> archive !!!  with a pre-owned panasonic s1r (for the pixel shift multi shot function) and a sigma macro. it is light years ahead of flatbed scanning and works so well i started putting film in my film cameras again, including the m6. i can\u2019t emphasize enough how pleased i am to have meaningful access to almost 30 years of negatives and slides to print on modern inkjets. i decide upon the s1r for scanning because in the back of my mind i was aware that i could put all my cl lenses (l mount) on the s1r and then have ibis capability and 20 megapixels available\u2014if i wanted. then took out the m-l adapter and put my 35 and 50 on the s1r. wow! 47 megapixel of niceness and none of the edge smearing that i saw on the sonys (2 paragraphs back), not perfect on the 35 but real darn close. focus peaking worked great. but it\u2019s still more camera than i will carry around. for a moment i regretted not jumping right to the sl2 which has the clean interface i know from the q2 and cl, but the s1r pre-owned was about $2k and an sl2 was going to be well over $5k and i wasn\u2019t convinced i would still carry it regular. i just can\u2019t picture myself buying leica sl lenses, not because of the cost, but because of the size. no how, no way. but my appetite has been whetted to use my diminutive m lenses on a camera i will carry. and the sour taste of the m9 is gone and while most of my time here on the l-forum has been focused on q and cl cameras i have been aware that the digital rangefinder has really matured. so i bought an m10-p. it is slim and beautiful, and oh, that shutter, what a change from m9 days! i was a bit concerned about how i would get along with the rangefinder (focus accuracy) since eyeglasses became a part of my wardrobe. i know that digital is more demanding of focus than film. it\u2019s going quite well, performance checking focus accuracy on the live view and picture review is very instructive. the fluid motion of focus and shutter release has returned helped out by setting 1/4f in auto. ibis or high iso performance seem to serve the same function and now we have high iso performance, it places this camera in a different league of usability over film or the old m9. i\u2019ve also found that i can frame, focus and shoot (at least indoors) using solely the rear screen quite well. that\u2019s mostly how i use my q2 indoors also. i am going to the leica store tomorrow to pick up a visolflex 020. i know some people swear by it, others say it sits in their bag unused. i get the feeling it is what will make the m useable, for me, close focusing (or critical focusing?) outdoors. the only real decision is do i exchange the m10p for the m10r?

I think today I would first try to digitize with a digital camera. What then is important is to have a good lens (or full correction of its flaws like distortion and vignetting) and preferably a APS-C sensor than full frame as this sensor has higher depth of field. DOF must be higher than uneven film. In order to reduce unevenness of film I cut and put the film in the paper pouches shortly after drying and the let them under a big book during the night. Next morning the film is very even and stays so. Lab development usually gives you well curved negatives. Concerning lab scans: the are often of lower resolution and only JPG instead of TIFF or high priced. I now scan every negative with 3600dpi, independent if it seems to be a good or bad capture. So I have a full archive of my analog work. BW scan is not complicated as you do not have to care about colors. A scanner ha the following advantages: No uneven quality due to the digitizing lens\u2019 flaws, possibility to repair dust, scratches and marks on color film (with infrared channel scanning); this feature does not work on BW film (and Kodachrome) as the silver does not permit the use of IR scan. The disadvantage is surely the slow digitizing process.

Photobooks generally only allow the insertion of JPEG files. Since the DNGs are , at least in my opinion , far superior I would regrettably have to convert the DNGs into JPEGS. Will converting the DNG\u2019s to JPEGS result in loss of image quality on the final print ? Thanks. Adam As others have said, raw files are always converted ... better word: rendered ... to JPEG or TIFF for printing in any form. How are you editing and viewing your CL photographs at present? If you're using Lightroom, either CC or Classic, and viewing them directly on screen, you may not realize it but LR is converting the raw/DNG files to a viewable RGB format for you on the fly. It has to do this in order to display them. When you Export your finished, edited work from LR, it is always output as some RGB format ... PSD, TIFF, or JPEG ... unless you specifically tell it to output a file to DNG or 'original' formats for archive/storage purposes. Thus, there is no \"loss of quality\" when you convert DNG files to JPEG or other export format ... The goal of editing your photos in LR or any other image processing app is to render the DNG raw files into the suitable form and look that you want for display or sharing, or printing, or inclusion into other works for printing and distribution. You edit (render) the DNG files to look the way they ought to look for whatever the display or distribution format is needed. If you want to make a photo book using the Blurb.com \"print on demand\" services, there is in fact a standard module in LR for that which will allow you to edit and complete your book layout using your DNG files just as you have them in Lightroom. When you have finished editing your photos, then laying out your book, and tell LR to send it to Blurb for printing, LR renders the book into a suitable RGB format for printing directly and sends that to Blurb.
