I use LR 6.14 and it is also 64bit and occasionally I get the same message, haven't done anything about it yet but will probably have to use the CC Desktop App in the future. If I was cynical I might suggest that it's Adobe trying to 'encourage' users to move over to the CC version in the future as it will generate them more money, but they wouldn't do that would they.
