The M8 upgrade program allows the framelines to be changed for ones which are calibrated at around 2m shooting distance instead of the closest focus of 0.7m. This has the effect of balancing the framing error between closest focus and infinity to provide a more acceptable result. If you're contemplating this update and want to know what's involved, or just wondered how they work, this thread is for you! To begin... The framelines work by projecting light through a series of slits in two metal masks; one is in a fixed position and the other slides diagonally behind it. By clever design, in each of three positions of the movable mask, slits in the two masks coincide to allow the light through. This then appears as a frameline injected into the viewfinder. In the M7 and M8, there is also an LED display (just like the old red LED calculators) to display the AE shutter speed, manual metering and flash indicators. Here's the fixed mask... --img--  You can see the familiar layout of the framelines; counting from the outside: 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 75mm, 90mm. Note that the 75mm frame is scarcely bigger than the 90mm frame; no wonder the 75mm frame is the most inaccurate. If you wanted to eliminate some of the frames, \"all\" you have to do is black out the slits you don't want. The centre rectangle defines the rangefinder patch. It's through this aperture that the image from the rangefinder window is projected into the viewfinder. Without the masks in place, you see a much larger image with parts of it superimposing the main viewfinder image, other parts being split from it, depending on distance; confusing and the rectangle constrains the rangefinder image to the centre. The two holes top left and bottom right are used to locate the mask in the carrier; only one round hole is required; the second is elongated to ensure the mask sits flat. The diagonal slot top left is used to locate a spring which provides the audible \"click\" when the framelines change. This mask is tiny, around 15mm wide, so you can imagine how small the slits are and how accurately located. It's not clear how they are made. In former times, I expect they were stamped, now, it would make sense to cut them using a laser. Either way, an expensive component to make. At the bottom, an identifier for this type of mask: M8, 0.68 (viewfinder magnification), 6 (frame count). You can just make out a clear plastic block in front of the lower aperture. This is where the viewfinder LED display is mounted. It's not clear what it's for. I think it is some sort of light \"pipe\" to increase the display contrast. Here's an oblique view of the same mask - you can see the plastic block super-glued on to the mask - at six points it turns out after mine fell apart. Easily re-glued using Loctite 4062, a very low viscosity cyanoacrylate. Steady hand required, easy on the Rioja the previous night! --img--  Here is the moveable mask which sits behind the fixed mask and moves diagonally. The pattern of slits may look odd but keep in mind that their only purpose is to align with the slits in the fixed mask when the moveable mask is set to one of three positions. --img--  There are now two diagonal slots top left and bottom right so the mask can move along this axis. The strange shape top left is to allow the framelines to click into place. The spring expands into the zig-zag edges and causes this mask to settle into the correct position. The diagonal slot right centre is used to set the position of the mask. A pin actuated by the frame selection lever engages in the slot and moves the mask in the required direction. Now, here's the clever bit. The whole mask assembly can be shifted to provide parallax correction and that movement takes place in the other diagonal direction, bottom left to top right. Notice how the frame selection slot is parallel with that movement - the two directions of movement are orthogonal so that a movement in one direction (as you focus closely) is not affected by a movement in the other (as you select a new lens).

All for free! As you can see clearly in the photo of my LC1 below, the sensor is actually attached to the lens with three T4 (or T5, I forget) screws.

The sensor can indeed be removed from the lens and replaced separately, and Panasonic lists the sensor for sale as a separate part at its online parts site. I all know this for a fact because I've modified one of my cameras by removing the OEM hot filter that goes between the sensor and lens (the purplish piece of glass you see sitting on the right side of the camera) and replacing it with an IR-pass only filter to dedicate it to IR operation. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to write anything further about the conversion (the only tricky bit was cutting the glass for the filter and sizing it to its final dimensions) or post any of the photos I've shot with the camera setup this way, but it's working great so far and I will be taking it to the Grand Canyon with me on my upcoming photo outing, so I'm expecting to give it a thorough workout shortly. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/20016-do-digilux-2-photos-have-distinctive-look/page/13/?tab=comments#comment-623511", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "that explains why my lens looked completely new after i had my sensor replaced in june this year! all for free! as you can see clearly in the photo of my lc1 below, the sensor is actually attached to the lens with three t4 (or t5, i forget) screws. under the screws are spacers and springs that serve to properly -----> position !!!  the sensor and take up any slack in tolerances from unit-to-unit. the sensor can indeed be removed from the lens and replaced separately, and panasonic lists the sensor for sale as a separate part at its online parts site. i all know this for a fact because i've modified one of my cameras by removing the oem hot filter that goes between the sensor and lens (the purplish piece of glass you see sitting on the right side of the camera) and replacing it with an ir-pass only filter to dedicate it to ir operation. unfortunately, i haven't had time to write anything further about the conversion (the only tricky bit was cutting the glass for the filter and sizing it to its final dimensions) or post any of the photos i've shot with the camera setup this way, but it's working great so far and i will be taking it to the grand canyon with me on my upcoming photo outing, so i'm expecting to give it a thorough workout shortly. --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 15478, "year": "2008"}], "name": "positionL-Forum2008"}
