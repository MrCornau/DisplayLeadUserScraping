Very early rigid had f18 stop, I have seen 3 only, two of them with faked SN (genuine lens though). Around SN186xxx some lenses had black rim, both nickel and chrome may be found. All lenses which I have seen were in meters 2. Collapsible - some of the rigid lenses were converted to collapsible in factory before shipping, many have been converted by users. Lowest collapsible SN I have seen was 167857. Black rim versions of collapsible may be found in both nickel and chrome, SN around 192xxx. Early lenses did not have neither R (infrared) nor 2.9 marking for Agfafilter.Aperture ring had 2 \"ears\" (delimiters for aperture) and one additional screw.

Around SN 314xxx construction of aperture ring has been modified, \"ears\" and additional 3rd screw were gone. Around 258xxx font for engraving (mount and aperture ring) was modified to a narrower one 3. Tropen Summar - very rare version, to be found between 410190 and 410355 (SNs which I have seen). In contrary to regular Summar where the first optical element was a single lens the Tropen version has cemented group of 2 elements And finaly two comments: - Luigi is right saying that all Summars have white paint engravings on black background on the front ring.

I must do a 'class' photo of all 12 of the Summars in my collection. Among the variations and 'add ons' to be noted in my collection are the following: 1. Rigid or collapsible 2. Nickel or chrome 3. With and without black rim on both nickel and chrome 4. F2.9 mark for Agfa Colour film (with and without) 5. Ears on aperture ring (with and without) 6. Infra Red markings (with and without) 8.
