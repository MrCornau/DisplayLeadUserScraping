If your shadows are due to actual shade (and not low-reflecting subjects), then they're gonna be really dark in infrared. There just isn't much infrared light in shade. When an object is in shade, it's lit by the scattered light in the atmosphere, and not directly (Rayleigh scattering). Blue light (and UV) scatters the most, red (and IR) scatters the least. This is also why the sky appears blue btw. Anyway, long story short, this is the reason shade looks blueish, say with slide film. So if there isn't much red light in shade, there's even less IR. This creates harsh shadows when your main source of illumination is IR light, like when shooting with an IR72 filter. It can be an interesting effect when used creatively. (This is also the reason why the areas around the eyes, shaded by eyesocket and cheekbones, appears dark on IR film, giving an eerie/demonic look ) All that said, I find IR400's box speed of ISO400 to be optimistic, in most developers. Also telling is that the dev time listed for ISO400 is quite long for normal development compared to other films, it looks more like a push time.

If your shadows are due to actual shade (and not low-reflecting subjects), then they're gonna be really dark in infrared. There just isn't much infrared light in shade. When an object is in shade, it's lit by the scattered light in the atmosphere, and not directly (Rayleigh scattering). Blue light (and UV) scatters the most, red (and IR) scatters the least. This is also why the sky appears blue btw. Anyway, long story short, this is the reason shade looks blueish, say with slide film. So if there isn't much red light in shade, there's even less IR. This creates harsh shadows when your main source of illumination is IR light, like when shooting with an IR72 filter. It can be an interesting effect when used creatively. (This is also the reason why the areas around the eyes, shaded by eyesocket and cheekbones, appears dark on IR film, giving an eerie/demonic look ) All that said, I find IR400's box speed of ISO400 to be optimistic, in most developers. Also telling is that the dev time listed for ISO400 is quite long for normal development compared to other films, it looks more like a push time. I almost always shoot it at 200, with slight reduction in dev time. --img--  Edited June 4, 2020 by giannis typos", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 100692, "searchterm": "artificial intelligence", "wiki_plot_tokenized": "['tommonego', 'gmail', 'com', 'use', 'filter', 'filter', 'find', 'loss', 'shadow', 'inaccurate', 'metering', 'inherent', 'characteristic', 'infrared', 'light', 'shadow', 'actual', 'shade', 'low', 'reflect', 'subject', 'going', 'dark', 'infrared', 'infrare', 'light', 'shade', 'object', 'shade', 'light', 'scatter', 'light', 'atmosphere', 'directly', 'rayleigh', 'scattering', 'blue', 'light', 'scatter', 'red', 'scatter', 'sky', 'appear', 'blue', 'btw', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'reason', 'shade', 'look', 'blueish', 'slide', 'film', 'red', 'light', 'shade', 'create', 'harsh', 'shadow', 'main', 'source', 'illumination', 'light', 'like', 'shoot', 'filter', 'interesting', 'effect', 'use', 'creatively', 'reason', 'area', 'eye', 'shade', 'eyesocket', 'cheekbone', 'appear', 'dark', 'film', 'eerie', 'demonic', 'look', 'find', 'box', 'speed', 'optimistic', 'developer', 'tell', 'dev', 'time', 'list', 'long', 'normal', 'development', 'compare', 'film', 'look', 'like', 'push', 'time', 'shoot', 'slight', 'reduction', 'dev', 'time', 'img', 'edit', 'june', 'giannis', 'typo']", "scores": "{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.908, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.8367}", "Sentiment": "positive", "TB_score": null, "Emotion": null, "temp_list": null, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 88, "Relevance": 44.82, "content": " 56 minutes ago, Sjz said: When I say I enjoy learning, it is not so much about how to use a specific camera, but how to get the most out of b+w, I guess older books as b+w is a bit niche now...l.
