I don't think the likely low demand is the problem but the fact that I just can't see how such a camera could make any kind of commercial sense for the company, can anyone see anyway in which it would grow Leica's sales overall? I agree. Let's go back to the problems raised by the original post: the M240 is thicker and heavier than the M6. This is a problem of the the current technology. The solution to such a problem isn't to take technology (such as the LCD) away, but to improve it. For example, Nikon & Canon responded to the problem of electronics being sensitive to moisture by developing better sealed cameras & lenses. Sony responded to the problem of full frame cameras being too big by making smaller full frame cameras. Panasonic responded to the problem of laptops being too sensitive for some work environments by developing their line of rugged Toughbooks. Apple responded to the problems of computers & phones being too complex by improving the user interface. Even Leica responded to the problem of the easily scratched LCD by introducing tougher glass. Other manufacturers have offered a flip out LCD that can flipped to a closed & protected position. In each case, the solution was not to take technology away, or to go backwards to a simpler technology (e.g. laptop to typewriter). Instead, the solution was to improve & refine the existing technology. I imagine and hope that the digital M6 \u2014 in size, weight, thickness, toughness, minimalism, etc. \u2014 can be achieved at some point by improvements in technology rather than by elimination of technology.
