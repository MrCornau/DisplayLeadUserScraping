It might be one of the more isolated parts of the bike although security might be an issue. Sean Over the years I've actually used my hand many times to touch various points of the bike to try and gauge relative vibration levels. I long ago concluded that the gas tank is almost always the smoothest part of a bike - often by a considerable margin. That's why a tank bag is my preferred location for sensitive equipment on any long ride. That does raise potential security issues when off the bike, of course, but I solve those by either taking my camera with me or by taking the whole tank bag. The seat is usually the next smoothest, in my experience - which is why a tail pack strapped to the passenger seat often works well for those who like that sort of thing. I generally don't, much preferring hard luggage. I'd agree with the comments about saddlebags not being ideal locations with respect to vibration isolation. And tail trunks, being suspended high and aft of the rear wheel, are the worst of all. That probably doesn't make much difference in an extremely smooth motorcycle like a (previous generation) K12 or a Goldwing. But those bikes are the exceptions. I wouldn't carry sensitive gear in the tail trunk of most bikes. On day rides, where I don't want to hassle with a tank bag, I'll simply place my A&A bag (with its inherent padding) in the right saddlebag (side away from the exhaust pipe). I remain comfortable with doing that on my K1200RS. But I still have misgivings about doing that on my R1200GS. Mostly, I'm concerned with longer trips, since those are the ones I most would like to record photographically. If the conclusion ended up being that the gas tank is the only viable location, I'd be fine with that since that's a manageable situation. My angst continues around the question of whether even that is acceptable on anything other than the very smoothest motorcycles out there. I dunno. I certainly recognize that some amount of vibration is inherent to much of what we do, often without us even being aware of it. I've carried an M camera to work with me every day for the last several years (previously my M7; now my M8) in a Domke F-803 Satchel. Touch the passenger seat in my Honda Civic, upon which that Domke bag sits, and you can clearly feel a constant, albeit mild, vibration. If I drive my Toyota pickup, that vibrates a bit more. And the metro train which I ride every day has some vibration. But, rightly or wrongly, I've rationalized that all those fall beneath the threshold at which measurable/predictable equipment deterioration would begin. If I flew frequently, I'd worry about that - aircraft frames typically transmit considerable vibration. But I only fly occasionally and so that's not a concern. I'm not particularly worried about the one-time effects from a single trip. If I were contemplating a 3-week cross-country excursion to California, I'd carry my M8 and lenses and wouldn't give it a second thought. I'm not even unduly worried about an entire season of riding. What does worry me are the cumulative effect of subjecting my gear to pervasive vibration over many months and years. I spend a lot of time on motorcycles. The irony is that although I've certainly given this topic a lot of thought over the years - certainly this is not the first time I've ever considered how and where to carry expensive camera gear - this is the first time I've really anguished over it.

There is measuring it (amplitude, frequency), there is the issue of duration, and finally, resonance. We don't know the resonance for a camera, and in fact, there will be many different ones. It is likely that sometime over a long duration on a bike, somehow it will match up with the bike vibrations. Maybe a wee bit, maybe a lot. But it doesn't take a lot to do some modest and internal damage. People are correct in noting that the resonance on a bike will vary enormously. The bike will vibrate differently at different places, times, and speeds. So too, where the item is located, and its own internal natural frequencies impacts this. One of the issues with cameras on bikes is that there are lots of small bits in a camera, and the bike vibration has a lovely tendency to \"loosen\" up these connections. Which ones, in what way, no one really knows. It depends on the bike, how its mounted, how long, etc. Its probably the case for a short time, vibration from the bike is probably no big deal. We take cameras on planes, cars, etc, but then again, the buzzing on a bike is more directly effective to a camera than it would be on a plane in an overhead compartment. Of course, what do we mean by short? Who knows? One person's 15 minutes is another persons weekly commute. Overall, The safest is to minimize any or all of the connections of the camera to the bike. Break the linkage of the vibration to the camera. Isolation helps here - but it really should be isolated. To do this, carrying the camera on the body is the best place but its not the safest for the body in the event of a crash. The tank bag is probably next best location, but the camera should be wrapped in a couple of different layers of foam (each will stop different vibration frequencies). If teh side bags are rubber mounted, then the same thing might hold true there as well. More layers of packing to make more isolation will help, but the last layer of protection should aim toward isolating or \"floating\" the camera as best as you can from the bike. Imagine the camera as a fine pocketwatch. Pack it accordingly! All in all - a little trip here and there, or even a week long trip carefully packed probably won't do damage. But imagine a mechanical entity on a month long ride - and that vibration will probably do something somewhere. If one could see all the places, and tighten them up, it wouldn't be a worry.
