If I cant get consistent focus with a lens than it leads to worse images. Thats how I see it. Some things might be discussed on a very theoretical base, but precise focus is something which has a lot of influence on the result/the image. To talk with your words: if I get consistently better results with one golf club compared to another one than I just use the one I get the better results with. If I get good results with 4 golf clubs but only here and then with the fifth I assume it\u00b4s the club and not my game. Again, if you and others get good reliable results with the Noctilux on a digital M without any focus shift- great, I tried for about 1 year (including sending the lens to Solms) and finally gave up. Regards, Tom Tom, there is nothing wrong with your lens. All Noctilux 1's have focus shift when stopping down - it's just the way they are. However this is not necessarily noticeable to all when photographing three dimensional objects. In addition, you (or your subject) only have to breath in order to subtly change the focus, so it is unlikely you will nail it each time - depending of course on your level perfectionism.

Lymphatic Filariasis Both pictures on the Noct 1 at F1 Hi Markus, thank you for your answer. adjusting the focus ring a little bit more when shooting wide open is a method I also saw as one potential solution. And it kind of worked ok. in the end I just felt that I prefered the 50lux asph- I felt more safe to get what I would expect and therefore sold my Noctilux. Again-I didnt want to bash the Noctilux or any other lens - I just mentioned my experience and if others have different experience and are happy with the lens thats all what counts.

When I focus my 50 at f1.4 I can nail the focus. This leads me to the conclusion that it is not about my eyes or focusing capabilities but about lenses. Shooting several images of the same portrait works - but IMO it is more like if you shoot 5 images one will be focused in a way that the focus-shift problem of the lens is compensated by random. I like to have 3 or 4 out of 5 in focus, and not 1 (eventually). It was not thre ruler-test in the first place, there were unsharp eyes in the first place. Some people may even think its user error. Couple things I learned from a lot of testing and practice: 1. The 50 1.4 asph has such excellent contrast that many times we are looking at a small amount of front and back focusing ....and the image still looks razor sharp. Printed the image can look perfect so from a practical standpoint it spot on. 2. A portrait can be a difficult test because ....with the right light the eyes can look brilliant and yet the focus can be off a little. To really know if you nailed something you need some texture or a scale . Shoot a newspaper at a 45 degree angle . Spot on means the exact letter in the word. Almost forgot....be sure to be at ISO 160 and not 640 or you may not find any letter sharp with a noctilux at its closest focusing point. 3. Not sure what the point of shooting a portrait at 1M at F1.0 might be other than a demonstration of skill. Most of the MF portrait photographers struggle to get enough depth of field to make the portrait attractive. I find the f1.0 much more useful at 3-10M where I can still use it to isolate the subject from the background while rendering most of the face in focus. 4. The logic behind the short burst ..2-3 is that things change. The subject moves , the subject blinks , the photographer moves etc. If the subject is static you don t need bursts (and I am not speaking of continuous mode) but rather a thoughful series of captures.

Hi Roger, 1: as far as I see the result/image as sharp I dont even care if it is due to contrast or not. 2: However if I feel there is a focus problem I shoot either a rule or prefer to shoot a coin on a carpet at several distances, and I would usually repeat it a couple of times since there are allways few shots which include user error. 3: I do use the M8/M9 a lot for family stuff and here I do use the 50mm focal length quite often at shorter distances. If I would shoot a protrait in the 3-10m distance and wanted shallow DOF I would probably rather use a longer focal length than 50mm. Here is a sample and I believe it even was with the Nocti at f1.0. IMO Shallow DOF can work for such images: --img--  Another sample of short distance wide open portrait (with a Zeiss 110/2.0 on Medium Format-which should have as shallow DOF) --img--  4: yes, I agree there are often movements of the subject or the photographer to lead to unsharp images/wrong focus plane and a burst helps. A lens without focus problems does however help to increase the chance to get some good images in one burst. Its clear to me that shooting shallow DOF does allways include the risk to not nail focus.

I also have a D7 which is a fun camera to have for carrying in my pocket. The D2; however, remains my favorite! For its focal length, it is fine for much shooting-like the M Series. I learned on the M3 and went forward from that. The outstanding benefits of the D2 are: 1. The Digital Viewfinder! What a gift! When I was shooting in Death Valley, I could not see the taken image on my 5d because of the ambient light. I now use a Hoodman to take care of the problem; but the the D2; it was no problem. It was wonderful! I made a 12-foot pamorama of the sand dunes which is a killer: tack sharp, wonderful tones. It is also ideal fopr those of us who are visuall challenged and have to wear glasses. Adjust the diopter and you are ready to go and shoot with ease! 2. The grid option in the viewfinder makes keeping verticals accurate and panoramas [for post-work in Photoshop] easy to do properely. 3. Bounce Flash. What an easy way to capture a moment of compromised light and have the results come out looking natural and with ease! 4. The fine-focus option to use when using manual focus. I use this a lot of the time when I want to be certain the focus is spot on...and it works every time. I have made tack-sharp 20x24 prints with no compromise. The only drawback is the shutter lag. When I was shooting professional tennis and tried the D2, only by knowing the game well and anticipating the next move was I able to get a shot with the \"motor\" drive. I tried for some time to send my successful sports images from the Houston Astros baseball and the Mens National Clay Court Tennis Championships to Roger Horn of Leica USA to show him that despite the comment made to me by a Leica representative that \"Leica is not for sports\" that with care the D2 could do very credible work-work wich I subsequently had published, I might add but there was little positive response. This was a shame because the D2 can do a great deal of things very well. So yes, I think the D2 is a wonderful camera to have even with its few limitations and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, general camera. BTW It can use the Canon Speedlight in its hot shoe for a greater range of flash coverage as well!
