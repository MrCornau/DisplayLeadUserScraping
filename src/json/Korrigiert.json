As the photographer, I need to understand that, and adjust my settings accordingly. Bottom line, I \"understand\" this, but I'm not really sure how to apply it to real photographs I'm taking - beyond knowing that if the scene is overly bright or overly dark, I need to adjust the meter reading accordingly. Nothing I have yet read suggests specifically how to do this. Second thing, is the despite Marcus telling us he is going to explain how the meter works, he leaves out a very important part. If I'm right, the light hits the shutter curtain, with those gray areas marked on it, and the light is reflected back to sensors that must be somewhere in the camera - but I have no idea where they are. How many sensors are picking up this reflected light from the back of the camera (the shutter curtain), and where are they? Marcus never mentions them. Maybe I am wrong about this? I understand what the video is teaching us, about that one specific example scene. When I aim my M10 somewhere (at random), and I get the exposure indicators, or better yet with the visoflex, I also get a histogram, how do I know whether to use the suggested readings, or adapt them based on how light or dark the middle part of my scene is? I assume I just learn this by doing it, and eventually figure out what to do, and how. It's not like with a Nikon, where the camera can automatically guess at a correct exposure along with everything else - the Leica is giving us all the information to enable US to make the correct settings. That's what I need to learn how to do. (I haven't been having problems with this - thanks to what you have already posted here, I am getting exposures that seem perfect, by viewing the histogram in the Visoflex mostly - but I'm sure there is a lot that I still need to learn. Maybe I already know enough right now, but I have this nagging feeling that I don't really know how to get the best compromise for exposure. ....and besides, if I'm not using the Visoflex and/or Live View, then what do I do?) The M10 has three metering selections, but if I read things correctly, if I'm not using Live View or the Visoflex, all I can measure is \"center weighted\". Put differently, if I'm not using Live View or the Visoflex, it doesn't matter what I select - the camera will only do center-weighted. Is this really true? I think I'm going in the wrong direction, as nowadays I feel more comfortable with the M10 if I use the Visoflex. It also gets me GPS information, which I prefer. It's sad that the Visoflex uses up my battery so quickly, but it's beginning to feel like an essential accessory, which is also sort of effectively making my M10 into a \"DSLR\", or more so, a Mirrorless with all the tools that come with Mirrorless. I prefer the simplicity of the basic camera, and would prefer to only use the Visoflex for complicated situations, not as my normal camera attachment.

I was mildly frustrated by the M8s' crop and IR problems. I like the wide-angles I paid for to be wide-angles, and I definitely noticed subjects who were - STARTLED - by the hot-pink reflections from the IR-blocking filters. Especially large ones (90mm f/2 E55) - I nearly brought a band concert to a screeching halt when the singer did a double-take. The hot-pink filters did look a little like a tactical IR rifle scope, head-on. Nevertheless the M8 produced a couple of my most memorable (and top-selling) photographs, and a C/V 15mm (effective \"20mm\") saved my bacon at the wide end. And the cropping was useful in the studio. But I did switch to the 24x36 M9 the very first week it came out - pays to be good friends with your regional Leica rep. Finally - my 21mm f/2.8 was again a 21mm f/2.8. And the M9 did introduce me to the 75 focal lengths, whose close-focusing restored some of the M8's tight framing. I skipped over the M(240) variants: not enough improvement over the M9 technically; too much red; too fat; and I still hoped the \"3rd-window natural frameline illumination\" might make a comeback. I calculated the M9 should hold up for at least a decade. Added a used M9M for the ISO 10000. Then, of course, the sensor-corrosion problem came up. Fortunately, in my case, not until late 2015, and only a mild case (one hair-like track on the M9; the M9M already had a replacement sensor). A sad reflection on Leica and/or Kodak, but not a serious problem in my photography. By late 2016, I was getting ready to send in the M9 for free sensor replacement - and then the M10 was pre-announced in Jan. 2017. I downloaded some of the sample pix from dpreview.com. Shazzam! Thinner - a serious usable-ISO increase (1600 > 10000) - new Leica profile with close-to-M9 color/punch - larger and more precise RF for my 135mm f/4 and 75 f/1.4. And - at the time - actually at a lower price than my M9 had been at introduction ($6500 vs. $6950). A no-brainer change. Kept the M9 as backup until the \"last call\" for free sensor replacements, got it -----> fixed !!! , traded it for a second M10. I still miss the classic third-window on the front, a little.

This is because the rangefinder, unlike a view camera, SLR, or EVF camera, does not inspect the lens\u2019 image directly to evaluate focus. Instead, one mechanism gauges distance to subject (the wheel at the top of the shutter box and the mechanics it attaches to in the camera, and the ring that moves in and out of the inside of the mount of the lens), and an independent mechanism adjusts the lens to focus at that distance (the distance between sensor and lens mount in the camera, including film plane flatness where relevant, and the movement of the optical cell(s) relative to the mount in the lens). Both systems must agree in box camera and lens to achieve optimum focus. This is a surprisingly complex problem. Possibilities that come to mind for a system that focuses past infinity in the center of the frame include: It might be working as intended. The lens might have field curvature and the lens designer optimized it to attain maximum resolution, i.e. to be in focus, in a ring around the center of the image, not the axis or corners. With recent lenses, you might look at the MTF curves; in the curve for the appropriate aperture, if the lowest dashed/solid pair of curves slopes upward from the left edge before falling down toward the right edge, then this behavior can be expected (but is unlikely to be visible when viewing the full image). It might be working as intended, part two: the lens was calibrated to place focus in the middle of the thickness of a sheet of film, but it is being used on a digital sensor which does not behave as if it has thickness. In this case, the lens is effectively focusing behind the sensor, so focusing closer (moving the lens away from the sensor) improves resolution. It might be working as intended, part three: all lenses have aberrations, some of these aberrations occur mostly in front of or behind the focus plane, and some of those are reduced when changing aperture. Removing aberrations in front of the focus plane will shift optimum focus backwards without changing actual focus at all. Designers of lenses with this focus shift behavior must choose which aperture the focus setting is optimized for. It might be working as intended, part four: our metal lenses are more responsive to temperature changes than a well-designed plastic housing, so hot or cold temperatures have elongated/constricted enough material to change focus. I haven\u2019t heard of this in practice, though; or, if it has changed enough to alter focus, the photographer has more pressing issues. It is working as intended, part five: your demand for focus has exceeded the design specifications. This may well be expected of extreme lenses: 135/3.4, 90/2, 50/1.2 lenses or with wider aperture might be within allowable tolerances yet still not perform well together. Changing both or either might improve performance in that equipment pairing yet impair performance of the calibrated device with most other M systems. Neither are working as intended, but they both agree with each other, mostly. To make the system work, all M lenses and cameras are designed to align within a given tolerance of a certain specification. But the spec doesn\u2019t matter so long as the parts interacting do so agreeably. This is why testing multiple items helps identify the problem: if you have lens A, lens B, and camera 1, and two of them agree with each other but not the third, most likely the third would benefit from calibration. The camera is miscalibrated for focus throw: the shouldn\u2019t be a problem at infinity, but might be at any other distance. The camera is miscalibrated for infinity: all properly calibrated lenses tend to show the same error. Adjusting camera will improve its performance with most lenses. The lens is miscalibrated for focus throw: some lenses have been modified by people who didn\u2019t understand the system; sometimes this can be -----> fixed !!!  by rotating the modified part out of the way. The lens is miscalibrated for infinity: as above or can be adjusted with shims. The camera and/or lens are misaligned. This can be expected with devices that show significant dents, and also when using imprecise adapters. So, there can be no generic answer to satisfy this kind of problem. It is not uncommon for rangefinder shooters to learn that lens a at aperture b needs to be adjusted like so when working at distance c, and so forth. I know that this is not a satisfying answer, but it is part of the package deal when extracting such high image quality from mechanical devices of this size."}, {"autor": "Harvard Kiwi", "posts": "184 posts", "date": "08/19/2021 04:34  AM", "content": "Like everyone else, I don't think it's sensor corrosion.

The Tse Hsiao Chung's model looks like the Kameracraft specially the wooden grip and the battery acces, but the Arca profile is on a spare piece a choice that I don't find appropriate. On the other hand it will be more stable with the eyelet. Because of the manufacturing choices it is more expensive. As said above by elmars it comes a bit late, and may be for 3/100mm it won't fit the oncoming M11.

You might try \"calibrating\" the battery - run that battery right down to as close to 0% as you can, through regular use, and/or leaving it in the camera with the LCD on, and the camera set to \"never sleep\" until the camera shuts down due to low battery power. Then recharge it with the Leica charger and see what happens. BTW - since someone else is sure to mention it - that is not a \"good\" practice for every day, since done repeatedly and often, it will shorten the battery life. Modern Li-ions prefer being \"topped up\" from partial charge. But not a big deal to do once, if a battery is acting up anyway. If that doesn't work, the battery may simply be reaching end-of-life. Which is usually approximately 300-500 charge-discharge cycles. I had one M9 battery that eventually refused to charge more than 90% under any condition, as reported by the camera. That was after 6-7 years of recharging every few days. \"Recalibrating\" didn't work. Bought a new battery. As to why the Nite-Core may seem to work - could just be different settings in its safety circuits. It's willing to \"push\" the lithium ions back into place harder or longer.

Thinking about this and the RPP dark view of files makes me wish that Leica had not applied such a strong contrast curve to the M10 DNGs. Presumably they did this to get as close as possible, SOOC, to a higher contrast look then would otherwise be the case. You also wrote above that you prefer the M10-R colors. In RPP images also appear to have less saturation than with other raw developers: the explanation is that, Other converters set the defaults to increase contrast and saturation to provide colorful result by default. For example, Adobe Lightroom by default sets the Contrast to +25, Black Point to +5, Medium Contrast Curves, etc. Increasing the contrast automatically leads to an increase in saturation. When using RPP you start with a more \u201chonest\u201d (in terms of information contained in the file) pictures. The upshot of all this is that I would have preferred Leica to have applied less contrast to the M10 DNGs, and presumably this could be -----> fixed !!!  through a firmware upgrade, but that is not likely to happen. ________________________Frog Leaping photobook There is no dynamic range of shadows or highlights. Dynamic range is the ratio between the largest signal and smallest detectable signal. How do you define correctly exposed? I am not arguing what it should mean, but wondering what it means in the context of your post. IMO, when people evaluate a camera, they should evaluate it in combination with their favorite post processing tools. BTW, thanks for writing about Cobalt-Image camera profiles. I bought a bunch from them :)."}, {"autor": "Photoworks", "posts": "968 posts", "date": "07/12/2021 04:54  PM", "content": "57 minutes ago, Mark II said: My interpretation is that there probably is not much difference between the cameras other than the M10-R effectively doing the equivalent of shooting the M10 with a slight under-exposure and perhaps applying a different luminosity curve to compensate. the M10-R is a difference sensor.

I've searched the forum, but didn't find a related thread, apologies if I missed one. My camera works perfectly, except for the WiFi function. If I've read the instructions correctly, when I activate WiFi for the first time, the LED should blink green for a while (30 seconds?) and then should stop blinking, at which point the camera is now ready to connect to WiFi. On my particular camera, the green light never stops blinking, and I have left it in that mode for as long as 15 minutes. I'm pretty sure that I'm doing things correctly, but of course it's hard to tell, especially without a screen! Here are some additional details: My M10-D is running the latest firmware, version 2.7.5.0 (confirmed via DNG metadata) My iPhone is running iOS 14 and Leica FOTOS version 2.1.1 I have reset the iPhone's network settings repeatedly, flushing all WiFi settings and passwords, this has no effect I have installed and uninstalled the FOTOS app multiple times, also no effect Within FOTOS, I carefully say \"Yes\" or equivalent to all popups during the process of connecting to the camera's WiFi I have tried to connect to the WiFi with the base plate both on and off, makes no difference I have always had the battery at or near 100% when I've tried to connect, no difference I've tried with the base plate on and off, neither helps I have tried with and without SD card, also makes no difference The camera shows absolutely no other symptoms or issues of any kind I believe that the key to all of this is that the green light on the camera never stops blinking. This is clearly not what's supposed to happen, and I have no idea how to -----> fix !!!  it. I've communicated with Leica US, who've referred me to Germany. I thought it would probably make sense to check here as well. From my interactions with Leica (both multiple stores and NJ service department), it seems that they've had so few of these cameras pass through their hands that they have to look up the answers to questions I've had, instead of knowing how it operates first-hand. The camera works perfectly aside from this one issue, and I'd rather keep it as is than send it to Germany if it comes to that. But obviously I'd prefer to find a solution if possible."}, {"autor": "Joe Zobkiw", "posts": "18 posts", "date": "10/23/2020 11:50  AM", "content": "I would still get it -----> fixed !!! /replaced even if you don't care to use the WiFi - thinking of resale/trade-in value."}, {"autor": "WanderingEye", "posts": "10 posts", "date": "10/23/2020 11:27  PM", "content": "11 hours ago, Joe Zobkiw said: I would still get it -----> fixed !!! /replaced even if you don't care to use the WiFi - thinking of resale/trade-in value.

Lightroom has some future that I use that are better the C1P. the curve response from MID ti HIGH tone is still better in C1P to my taste. When the M10-R came on to the market Adobe had a temporary profile for it. the sensor color response is based on the Leica S3 and it different from he other M10's. Capture One tends to include a profile when it is ready. but at this point it is amazing how accurate the color response is from what you see on the camera screen and reality ."}, {"autor": "M10 for me", "posts": "2,377 posts", "date": "07/07/2018 06:15  PM", "content": "I like your question a lot as this is difficult to decide.

The coding, whether manual or built-in at the Leica factory, will affect both jpegs and raw files more or less equally. It affects the camera programming enroute between the sensor and the final file on the SD card. 2. The coding only automatically corrects, in the camera, for color vignetting and normal brightness vignetting (to a variable extent).* In addition, the fact that the lens type is then also recorded in a picture's EXIF metadata means that, after the fact, depending on what post-processing software one uses, the post-processing software (not the camera) may apply corrections for distortion and some regular vignetting. I have coded lenses, I use Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Camera Raw. They do absolutely nothing to -----> fix !!!  distortion or vignetting just because the lens is coded. Those still have to be manually corrected with sliders, coding or not. Other software may vary, and may have an \"on/off\" switch to automatically detect the lens type and apply corrections, or not - see post-processing software instructions 3. This site has a list of the 6-bit codes - not sure how up-to-date: https://lavidaleica.com/content/leica-lens-codes The L-Camera Forum used to, but right now our link is reading \"404.\" I've reported it - the mods may repair it. See top of the M Lenses subforum for the thread with the link. 4. Lightroom (or other) profiles will do zip/nada/nothing to -----> fix !!!  the color vignetting problem, when it exists. It has to be done in-camera at the moment of exposure for decent (and fast, automatic, seamless) results. I think Lightroom now has a \"flat-field\" plug-in that can help - but it stills requires some user intervention. Not as seamless as getting it -----> fix !!! ed at the moment of exposure, all the time, every picture. Only 1) coding the lens, or 2) using the camera's lens menu to identify the lens type in use, will -----> fix !!!  the color vignetting automatically and easily. ___________________ *The deal is this. Digital sensors do not play nicely with old-fashioned, rangefinder-type, close-to-the-sensor, wide-angle lenses (35mm or wider). This produces both brightness vignetting (closer and closer to the picture corners, not all the light gets to the silicon), and color vignetting (the light sometimes leaks from a red- or blue-filtered pixel onto a green-sensitive pixel (or vice-versa), and gets recorded as the wrong color). Lenses longer than 50mm usually do not show any vignetting problems if uncoded - they sit far enough away from the image plane/sensor. In the second case, this causes a measurable stain of magenta or blue-green along the short \"sides\" of the image and in the corners. A.K.A. \"Italian Flag syndrome.\" See photograph below. See diagram of older sensors (left), and the newer Leica CMOS sensors with different construction at the pixel level, which correct things partially. But not for all wide lenses - I can still see obvious problems with 35 and 28 images even on the M10 with the improved sensor, if the lenses are not coded, or ID'd via the lens menu. --img--  The Leica M color cameras have corrections built into their firmware to dial out both types of vignetting, if the camera \"knows\" exactly which lens was used. It adds or subtracts color from parts of the image right-now after exposure, while the image data is being processed in-camera enroute to the SD card. This shows what color vignetting looks like - pink stain on the left, cyan on the right (like an Italian flag: 1980 Leica 21mm Elmarit, with \"poor\" correction from early M9 firmware, 2010). --img--  Lenses' vignetting patterns are like fingerprints - they depend on the precise path the light takes passing through the particular shapes of glass in the optical layout. All 35mm f/2 Summicron ASPH lenses behave about the same, but not all 35mm f/2 lenses overall necessarily act the same. 35 Summicron v.4 non-ASPH needs different corrections than 35 Summicron ASPH, which needs different corrections (maybe) than a Voigtlander 35mm Ultron. Leica supplies different 6-bit codes for different 35mm f/2 Summicron lens designs (1980 vs. 1997, for example). Do not assume that any 21, or 24, or 28, or 35 coding will necessarily work with just anyone's lens of the same speed and focal length. However, some designs are similar enough - even from different manufacturers and eras, that they can work for each other. For example, the corrections for the Leica 35mm Summicron v.4 (1980) work quite well for the Voigtlander 35mm f/1.4 Nokton v.1/2 - because they are similar, compact Double-Gauss designs.

Digital sensors do not play nicely with old-fashioned, rangefinder-type, close-to-the-sensor, wide-angle lenses (35mm or wider). This produces both brightness vignetting (closer and closer to the picture corners, not all the light gets to the silicon), and color vignetting (the light sometimes leaks from a red- or blue-filtered pixel onto a green-sensitive pixel (or vice-versa), and gets recorded as the wrong color). Lenses longer than 50mm usually do not show any vignetting problems if uncoded - they sit far enough away from the image plane/sensor. In the second case, this causes a measurable stain of magenta or blue-green along the short \"sides\" of the image and in the corners. A.K.A. \"Italian Flag syndrome.\" See photograph below. See diagram of older sensors (left), and the newer Leica CMOS sensors with different construction at the pixel level, which correct things partially. But not for all wide lenses - I can still see obvious problems with 35 and 28 images even on the M10 with the improved sensor, if the lenses are not coded, or ID'd via the lens menu. --img--  The Leica M color cameras have corrections built into their firmware to dial out both types of vignetting, if the camera \"knows\" exactly which lens was used. It adds or subtracts color from parts of the image right-now after exposure, while the image data is being processed in-camera enroute to the SD card. This shows what color vignetting looks like - pink stain on the left, cyan on the right (like an Italian flag: 1980 Leica 21mm Elmarit, with \"poor\" correction from early M9 firmware, 2010). --img--  Lenses' vignetting patterns are like fingerprints - they depend on the precise path the light takes passing through the particular shapes of glass in the optical layout. All 35mm f/2 Summicron ASPH lenses behave about the same, but not all 35mm f/2 lenses overall necessarily act the same. 35 Summicron v.4 non-ASPH needs different corrections than 35 Summicron ASPH, which needs different corrections (maybe) than a Voigtlander 35mm Ultron. Leica supplies different 6-bit codes for different 35mm f/2 Summicron lens designs (1980 vs. 1997, for example). Do not assume that any 21, or 24, or 28, or 35 coding will necessarily work with just anyone's lens of the same speed and focal length. However, some designs are similar enough - even from different manufacturers and eras, that they can work for each other. For example, the corrections for the Leica 35mm Summicron v.4 (1980) work quite well for the Voigtlander 35mm f/1.4 Nokton v.1/2 - because they are similar, compact Double-Gauss designs.

Digital sensors do not play nicely with old-fashioned, rangefinder-type, close-to-the-sensor, wide-angle lenses (35mm or wider).

Lenses longer than 50mm usually do not show any vignetting problems if uncoded - they sit far enough away from the image plane/sensor.

Digital sensors do not play nicely with old-fashioned, rangefinder-type, close-to-the-sensor, wide-angle lenses (35mm or wider). This produces both brightness vignetting (closer and closer to the picture corners, not all the light gets to the silicon), and color vignetting (the light sometimes leaks from a red- or blue-filtered pixel onto a green-sensitive pixel (or vice-versa), and gets recorded as the wrong color). Lenses longer than 50mm usually do not show any vignetting problems if uncoded - they sit far enough away from the image plane/sensor. In the second case, this causes a measurable stain of magenta or blue-green along the short \"sides\" of the image and in the corners. A.K.A. \"Italian Flag syndrome.\" See photograph below. See diagram of older sensors (left), and the newer Leica CMOS sensors with different construction at the pixel level, which correct things partially. But not for all wide lenses - I can still see obvious problems with 35 and 28 images even on the M10 with the improved sensor, if the lenses are not coded, or ID'd via the lens menu. --img--  The Leica M color cameras have corrections built into their firmware to dial out both types of vignetting, if the camera \"knows\" exactly which lens was used. It adds or subtracts color from parts of the image right-now after exposure, while the image data is being processed in-camera enroute to the SD card.

All 35mm f/2 Summicron ASPH lenses behave about the same, but not all 35mm f/2 lenses overall necessarily act the same. 35 Summicron v.4 non-ASPH needs different corrections than 35 Summicron ASPH, which needs different corrections (maybe) than a Voigtlander 35mm Ultron. Leica supplies different 6-bit codes for different 35mm f/2 Summicron lens designs (1980 vs. 1997, for example). Do not assume that any 21, or 24, or 28, or 35 coding will necessarily work with just anyone's lens of the same speed and focal length. However, some designs are similar enough - even from different manufacturers and eras, that they can work for each other. For example, the corrections for the Leica 35mm Summicron v.4 (1980) work quite well for the Voigtlander 35mm f/1.4 Nokton v.1/2 - because they are similar, compact Double-Gauss designs. The reason I said the vignetting corrections are \"variable\" is that they are applied less strongly at higher ISOs, to prevent the -----> corrected !!!  corners/edges getting too noisy.

The coding, whether manual or built-in at the Leica factory, will affect both jpegs and raw files more or less equally. It affects the camera programming enroute between the sensor and the final file on the SD card. 2. The coding only automatically corrects, in the camera, for color vignetting and normal brightness vignetting (to a variable extent).* In addition, the fact that the lens type is then also recorded in a picture's EXIF metadata means that, after the fact, depending on what post-processing software one uses, the post-processing software (not the camera) may apply corrections for distortion and some regular vignetting. I have coded lenses, I use Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Camera Raw. They do absolutely nothing to fix distortion or vignetting just because the lens is coded. Those still have to be manually -----> corrected !!!  with sliders, coding or not. Other software may vary, and may have an \"on/off\" switch to automatically detect the lens type and apply corrections, or not - see post-processing software instructions 3. This site has a list of the 6-bit codes - not sure how up-to-date: https://lavidaleica.com/content/leica-lens-codes The L-Camera Forum used to, but right now our link is reading \"404.\" I've reported it - the mods may repair it. See top of the M Lenses subforum for the thread with the link. 4. Lightroom (or other) profiles will do zip/nada/nothing to fix the color vignetting problem, when it exists. It has to be done in-camera at the moment of exposure for decent (and fast, automatic, seamless) results. I think Lightroom now has a \"flat-field\" plug-in that can help - but it stills requires some user intervention. Not as seamless as getting it fixed at the moment of exposure, all the time, every picture. Only 1) coding the lens, or 2) using the camera's lens menu to identify the lens type in use, will fix the color vignetting automatically and easily. ___________________ *The deal is this. Digital sensors do not play nicely with old-fashioned, rangefinder-type, close-to-the-sensor, wide-angle lenses (35mm or wider). This produces both brightness vignetting (closer and closer to the picture corners, not all the light gets to the silicon), and color vignetting (the light sometimes leaks from a red- or blue-filtered pixel onto a green-sensitive pixel (or vice-versa), and gets recorded as the wrong color). Lenses longer than 50mm usually do not show any vignetting problems if uncoded - they sit far enough away from the image plane/sensor.

I've done M2,3 & 4s with the small screw and had no problems. I'll admit, removing the black screw on my M10M would make me sweat a bit, but so does removing the red dot on the M10! The only thing I would suggest is to take the camera to the hardware store (if you can) and buy a very high quality screw driver that fits properly. You can protect the camera body with tape and if you bugger the screw, I suppose you can order a replacement. Vertical enlightenment can be a bit frustrating as it is totally trial and error. The screw that you are turning is actually a cam, so there is no hard rule as to which direction to turn it. All depends on which side of the \"ramp\" you are on. Sometimes I get lucky and get it right quickly, other times it takes a while. But well worth the effort. Proper vertical adjustment allows for focusing the image rather than always looking for vertical elements. I can focus on eyes by focusing on catchlights, tree bark etc by superimposing the texture until the image gets clear, not possible with the vertical out of alignment. I decided to only adjust the horizontal to get a feel of what's up, but the next day it it was off again, so probably some thing loose in the camera. I did not attempt the vertical due to the screw but yes, it has been bothering me for a while.

This happens when using the 35 Summicron, 50 APO and 50 Summilux. Thanks. It sometimes happens. Some lenses, especially third-party ones will focus slightly beyond infinity. Take a few test shots to see whether the shots you take with the camera focused to infinity are sharper than the ones with the lens turned all the way. If the \"lens\" shots are sharper your camera or lens -or both- need calibration. Ideally you need an optical bench to calibrate properly, although it can be done using Live View - many Leica specialists can do the job for you. A simple tweaking of the camera infinity setting is an easy DIY job. Infinity is quite a bit further than 1500 feet for the rangefinder, irrespective of focal length.

The M works the same way as any rangefinder camera, the central patch in the viewfinder is your focusing tool. It is important to look through the viewfinder in the optical axis.

If you can rule out pilot error, you might have somebody knowlegeable look at the calibration of both camera and lens, although miscalibration is not very common these days. Quote Question: I come from an autofocus camera background. What is the best way to get good focus on an M camera? The M works the same way as any rangefinder camera, the central patch in the viewfinder is your focusing tool. It is important to look through the viewfinder in the optical axis. Looking into the camera skewed will result in inaccurate focus. The first thing to do is to ascertain that you can see the rangefinder patch properly. A correct match between the rangefinder and your eye is even more important than it is using an SLR. Leica sells corrective diopter lenses. Determining which one you need - if any- can be done by going to your optician and holding his try-out lenses between your eye and the viewfinder. The one that allows you to see the rangefinder patch and framelines sharply is the correct one. Order the nearest value from Leica. In a pinch you can use over-the-counter reading glasses for this test. If your eyes need special corrections, you can use your spectacles, provided you can see clearly at 2 meters distance ( the virtual distance of the rangefinder patch). Note that the background will be at background distance,so your eye should ideally be able to accommodate over the distance differential. However, there is some tolerance here.

Thank you, this is very helpful info. Where I was having trouble at sunset yesterday was in the near-specular highlights, such as the sun-facing side of a light-colored blade of grass. The grass in the photo I posted was exposed correctly, but I had quite a few that looked ok in live view but were just a bit too hot. I will try out your suggestions and practice! 6 hours ago, mujk said: It's good to remember that the M10 has two separate metering systems. The one in use when only the OVF is in use (shutter closed during metering) has exactly one mode, more or less equal to center-weighted metering. When liveview/Viso is in use (shutter open), there are three different modes to choose from. This may be a bit confusing in the beginning. Wow, thank you. I totally missed that in my pre-M research and my skimming of the FAQ questions here, but that makes perfect sense.

So please indicate what works as described in the various versions of LR that are currently in use -- Classic, CC, etc. I think it will be helpful. By the end of the beta session, we were all still learning how to use the results. But we liked the new feature.

In fact, I have never needed to adjust mine, even after having manged to drop the camera twice (which is not usual for me). For example, my M9 rangefinder needed adjustment every now and then. So your description of the problem sounds a bit strange to me, particularly the problem reappearing after a short time. @jaapv pointed out a few possible reasons, but I would even suspect that there is something loose inside the rangefinder mechanism, even if I have never heard about that this could happen. That is what I thought. But after asking around locally there have been various cases of people having to send their M10s and M10-Ps in for adjustment already, even without dropping them. Maybe it's the heat and humidity? \ud83d\ude06 I think there's definitely something loose inside the camera. I adjusted the horizontal focus myself just to see what's up, and the next day it was off again. I've since sent it in to a local 3rd party Leica repair shop for a full CLA (There's also dust in the viewfinder, amongst other things). Will see when it comes back next month whether the issue has been solved. On 2/15/2021 at 3:35 AM, Tobers said: This is why I quit the M world. This finicky rangefinder adjustment situation killed the user experience for me, even though I loved my M9, M240 and M10 bodies. There seemed no point getting the Lux lenses when you couldn\u2019t focus them properly wide open. I did end up doing some rangefinder adjustment myself (it\u2019s actually not very hard). But for those expecting pixel-peeper levels of sharpness consistently at f/1.4 you may be disappointed. This is my first M. I love it but I can now see why some have 2nd bodies.

Without a doubt, I think the Biogon has a better IQ of this group, but it's 2.8. If you need a faster lens, it doesn't work. For some is enough; for others, it's not. I don't like his weird focus knob (or focus tab or nothing would be better), and the aperture stops by 1/3 ... Besides that, wow. It's an incredible lens. The TT is more notable, heavier (400gr), but it performs well. It has a nice kind of mixed characters: modern lens (not clinical) but with a lovely smooth rendering.

Welcome to the forum. \ud83d\ude42 Most Zeiss ZM, and all Voigtlander lenses, are made by Cosina. My early compact/budget 35mm purchase was a older Leica Summaron-M 35mm, purchased for a few hundred US dollars, but the comparable Zeiss ZM 2,8/35mm Biogon has an excellent reputation. I have other Zeiss lenses, for Leica M and for SLR cameras. I doubt that you will be disappointed. I added the Leica M system after retirement, too, almost three years ago. It was a pre-owned Summilux-M 50mm ASPH that \u201chooked\u201d me, and then I had to decide which camera to buy. I ran the figures, and decided upon a new M10.

The camera sometimes shut down after taking a few photos. Half press the shutter it woke up again. But the shooting opportunity was gone as it took few seconds for it to wake up. Moreover, the LV button would stuck when the camera and the shooting environment was hot (over 30 degree celsius), while the MENU and PLAY button still able to work perfectly.

If it was back to Wetzlar then I am very surprised that you've experienced all these problems, extremely frustrating and annoying because I've nothing but good things to say for my repair/service experiences with Wetzlar, even though yes I do tend to agree that perhaps that the digital Leica M's do need more service or repairing than other brands I've used for 4-5 decades which is a pity because there's nothing even close to my mind to an M as a photographic tool. In your case I'd try a telephone call to Customer Service in Wetzlar, irrespective as to whether they did the repairs for you, ask for a manager and outline these troubles, following it up with a personal email to whoever you manage to talk to. It's sad, but it does appear that you are going to have to \"rattle the cage\" over this. Good luck, but don't give up yet on the M! Thanks for your kind reply. Yes, the camera was sent to Wetzlar and as you described, it is extremely frustrating and annoying as M10 is the most unstable digital camera I own. I owned my first DC since 1998 and even the cheapest one was much more stable than M10. I have a friend who own an M10 and he also have bad experience such as needed to remove battery to -----> fix !!!  a freeze. I have to say again I don't expect M10 is perfect, but I expect it can be repaired and I also expect the customer service can be better. I even asked them to bear the cost of shipping for this time but they refused. What makes me really upset is the screen protector was scratched after repairing. If I am the technician who made the scratch, I must replace for a new one for the customer rather than pretends nothing happened. This is the basic norm of a responsible after service department, right? But the Leica customer service didn't even reply \"I am sorry that your protector is scratched because......\" after I made the complaint. They perfer to remain silence. If the Leica service could not even do right in such minor aspect, how can I trust the whole repairing service and customer department? I have already send quite a lot of long emails to reflect the problems but what I can get is \"resend the camera for inspection\". They don't promise anything or try to do something. It is a good advice to find a manager, do anyone here have a email contact? I am not living in Germany, Europe or US, so direct calling may be not possible.

Thanks - I had this exact thing happen to me on my M10-P - freaked me out for a minute, then I removed the lens and watched carefully and felt the resistance as I put the lens back on. It's certainly a nice mechanical system but it can be sensitive at times.

That meter measured within a 90mm FOV, so with a 35 or 50 mm lens just moving the preview lever to the 90mm position would show the metering area. The 90mm frame is still a good approximation of the M10 center-weighted metering area, and can be a good reminder of how the meter is evaluating the scene. If you set up a pen-light aimed at the camera in a darkened room and watch the meter as you move the VF around, you'll see how the meter responds mainly in the 90mm FOV. OF course, with experience you can judge the area without resorting to a preview of the frame. This depends on the focal length of the lens, because in current Ms exposure is metered through the lens and is consequently always the same percentage of the frame size.

You are right - since the LeicaMeter MR was external, the 90 frame was always accurate for metering, but with the M10 (ttl) it is reasonable between 35 & 50 lenses.

Basically i used an M240 for the most part of 5 years, itched for something new and went through Sony, Canon, Fuji GFX, Sigma FP, Leica SL/2 cameras before realising I just want to shoot with Leica bodies, and within that brand, preferably M cameras (I only like shooting with M glass so an M camera is best for this, along with the form factor of the body, physical dials, simple button layout, etc.). My process wasn't as \"clean\" as yours in that I still had my M lenses and 1 of my 2 current M bodies whilst going through all those other bodies and systems. In any case, it was plenty of soul searching of sorts and a very restless time gear wise. I'm now perfectly contented with my M10M and M10D, two cameras which I feel compliment each other well. I had always wanted a monochrom and was always drawn to the idea of learning how to shoot in b&w as I never had the discipline to convert my pictures to b&w in post. Likewise, i was always drawn to the idea of a screen-less M. Not that I had any major issues with chimping (or so i didn't think i did, until i got the M10D last month). I chose those 2 cameras because I felt they could teach me more than a colour M could alone. People might dismiss the idea that seeing in black and white changes how you shoot, but I've experienced it first hand, as have you. One is forced to think of better ways to draw the viewer's eye. I move more, I look for stronger lines, contrast and shadow more. It's a subtle shift but it's there. The M10D has made me make sure I get the shot when I'm \"getting the shot\". I don't take for granted that I'm shooting digital so much any more. Being forced to shoot differently with these two cameras has made me improve more than any other camera has, aside from my initial few years with the M240 and with my Nikons when I first started photography. I may be a marketing victim, or convincing myself I made the right choices with the M10M and M10D, but hey if I feel a difference in my shooting and I'm enjoying this hobby more, isn't only relevant barometer the level of satisfaction I derive from using this gear? It's a breath of fresh air and I'm loving it. It's never going to be sensible in the grand scheme of things, to spend money on Leica gear. If I was rational and wanted just one M, I'd have gone with an M10R. If I was rational and just wanted a camera a Nikon Z (or even a DSLR from yesteryears) would suffice. Have the two cameras delivered what I thought they would? Absolutely. And I feel I have plenty to grow into and any limitations are on me. The beauty of the monochroms and the D versions is that you're paying a high price of entry for the concept and way of shooting they promote. It's kinda like paying the high price of entry for an M, but this time a niche within the niche. Once you own a mono/D, even if a new model comes out, the incentives would merely be technological. With cameras this good these days, and with the M10 form factor, it'd be hard to make me give these up for a newer version. I suppose one could argue that if you want to buy the concept, then an M246 and M-D262 would be most economical - however having used the M10 series cameras, I don't think I could go back to the M240 body size and buttons (for M246). Speaking of GFX and Ms, one big reason why I got it was the 40mp bayerless sensor. After my experience with the GFX 50S, I was bitten by the high MP bug. Not because I print big or leave sloppy composition to be -----> fixed !!!  in post, but because every time I zoomed in past 100% in my GFX files, I saw so much it was downright fascinating that I could see all these \"new\" details I was capturing. You might appreciate the M10M or M10R on this basis alone, having come from the GFX100. On lenses on the cameras: I've kinda \"been there, done that\" with most lenses I've wanted. I owned/used fast glass, modern glass, vintage glass, limited edition lenses and sorted through what I wanted in my kit and got rid of the rest. Sometimes I feel I should have kept some of the glass I sold cause I took a while to acquire them, not to forget the adage about never selling Leica lenses. But the clutter bothered me more than the idea of selling them. I more than halved my kit and I now \"only\" have 5. 3 core lenses (28cron, 35FLE, 50APO) and 2 \"extra\"/superfluous ones (50 f1, 75lux) for portraits/Mandler days. My main pairing on the M10M tends to be a 28cron and 50APO. Both of these lenses have great clarity and don't embellish photos excessively, much in line with how I view my black and white shooting (no colours, fancy bokeh to spice up the pictures, but lines, shadows and contrast). One side thing I realised with the M10M is I prefer 28mm or 50mm on b&w whilst I prefer 35mm in colour (or prefer 28mm and 50mm less in colour?). Haven't really figured this one out yet, but it might have to do with 28mm giving more room to compose different angles, and 50mm giving an extra tightness to draw the viewer in. I do admit the 40mp sensor does make me want to put the 50APO on more than any other lens, because it can eek out the extra details. I often get pleasant surprises in my photos when I zoom in. This said, I have used Mandler glass on the M10M due to the charm of shooting oldish glass with b&w. With my glass and the M10M, it's very much \"same same but different\", in a pleasant way. I suppose I'm not really answering your higher MP camera + certain lenses question though, since my response has a b&w slant to it. My 35FLE lives on the M10D. Not much to say about this, as that lens could live on any M and I'd be happy camper (being a 35mm guy). Apologies for the long post.

I looked at another forum post here where someone shot a color chart with and without the IR filter, and there was definitely a magenta cast in the black fibers in a coat the model was wearing, and I wonder if that cast is still present in the skin tones, just more difficult to detect against a more fair complexion, but shows up/muddies the colors when working in post. To be clear, this effect is undetectable SOOC. It's only in post-processing when I begin to manipulate skin tones is it apparent. For my instance, I was attempting to saturate the face a bit, where generally I'd increase the oranges and reds. This had a bizarrely minimal effect. I then out of curiosity began pushing the other sliders, where you can see in the attached images that magenta and purple were extraordinarily present in the skin tones. Short of doing any additive -----> correct !!! ion via tools such as color grading the shadows and mid-tones to a warmer tone, it was impossible to modify the skin tones in any traditional manner (HSL, even WB modification lent no additional \"detail\" to move the colors harmoniously without performing a ballet of slider adjustments so as to not cause banding after touching the oranges, reds, yellows, magentas, and purples - something I've never had to do to this degree). In any event, I will investigate whether the IR filter remedies these issues. I had only seen this issue manifest in the backlit, flared scenarios. But I've been shooting under these conditions for over a decade, on both vintage and modern glass, and have never had an issue with skin tones even in \"harsh\" scenarios."}, {"autor": "LBJ2", "posts": "640 posts", "date": "01/04/2021 02:35  PM", "content": "@jaapv, or anybody else , what do I look for in my M10 images to know if there is UV/IR damage and is it very apparent or something I have to pixel peep for ?
