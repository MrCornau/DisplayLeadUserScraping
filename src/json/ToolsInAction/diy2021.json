MIG is just so easy you can figure it out yourself in about an hour. Especially flux core. Also here\u2019s the thing. Welding is not just a typical skill. It\u2019s NOT like riding a bike. I learned to ride a bike decades ago. I can get on a bike any time and just go. You don\u2019t lose it over time. With welding if you don\u2019t do it almost every day, you very quickly get rusty, especially with stick and TIG. You can\u2019t just grab a rid can and have at it. Best to burn a couple rods getting back in the groove. MIG however is so simple and easy it\u2019s actually like that. I believe anyone can operate a MIG with minimal practice and get it right. It\u2019s the perfect machine for weekend warriors that might not touch a welder for months. So for these reasons I suggest learning MIG first. Sure it will ruin you. So what.\\nNot a fan of \u201cmultiprocess\u201d. Let\u2019s face it though almost anything can stick weld so really we\u2019re talking about the difference between say a MIG suitcase welder and a TIG. You can buy a top end TIG for $800 (AHZp) and a decent MIG for $300 so total cost for all three major processes is $1100. The low end ESAB Rebels start at over $1500. I still wouldn\u2019t consider them good TIG machines compared to AHP. So you\u2019re just getting a very expensive MIG. Plus you can customize and set up each one separately and repair/replacement doesn\u2019t break the budget.\\nBig thing about TIG is the control. You can weld almost any metal, especially copper, aluminum at any thickness even aluminum foil, and even titanium. The downside is that it\u2019s slow and has a very high UV output although if it wasn\u2019t for that you could weld in a T shirt. A real TIG welder lets you alter the Positive and negative cycle to alter the cleaning vs welding effect and has HF start. The AHP has all that for around $800. In Miller and Lincoln you don\u2019t see that until almost $3000. Even the ESAB multiprocess doesn\u2019t have good TIG. Which is my point...different welders for different purposes. An all in one has too many compromises and kills the budget. You can also stick weld with these.\\nIn MIG look specifically for AC and DC. A decent suitcase welder will run close to the AHP price although as mentioned a decent basic HF one sets you back about half that. Again it stick welds too.\\nFinally don\u2019t forget brazing and torch welding. Both are like some kind of lost art. You can brake aluminum. It\u2019s not as good as TIG but costs almost nothing other than materials and takes almost no training, same with most brazing. Torch welding is one of the best ways to weld cast iron with high nickel rod so worth doing even if it\u2019s mostly forgotten. And torch sets are ridiculously cheap,\\nWhich brings me to my final point. The thing about welding is that you really are talking about fabrication. There are a lot of tools in fabrication that you really need and hold their own. Even before welding you need to cut material and frequently bevel it, and grind welds flat. Also need pre and post hearing. This means saws, grinders, drills, and a torch. Possibly many kinds if benders, presses, rams, and lots and lots of clamps. You can do a lot of things with all of these tools without a welder but not vice versa. In fact with the correct tip the torch welds as well as brazes.\\nI\u2019d suggest starting there first. Build up your fab shop first. Maybe get into 80/20 or T-slot stuff. I do a lot of fabrication all the time without a welder. Then MIG/stick and finally TIG, if you need it.\\nThe big thing about stick is penetration. You can use a 6011 P6 rod and burn through rusty, crappy junk steel and still make good quality root passes. An engine welder is a go anywhere tool. That\u2019s why you see one in probably half the service trucks on the road. It can do a lot and there are some truck rods but outside of steel it\u2019s pretty limited. There are high nickel rods that do decent on cast iron, stainless rods, and some so-so aluminum rods. Stick welders do excellent on thick structural aluminum,\\nIn MIG I used to scoff at it. It was for Saturday afternoon car shows only. But especially with electronic welders now we have dirt cheap teeny suitcase welders that can go anywhere. 220 is better but they can run off an extension cord! These are very fast and have quickly become the construction trade welder of choice. You can do aluminum but you have to run very fast and very hot. Very little smoke, very short learning curve. Biggest downside is bottles (except flux core) and you need to work at it for penetration.\\nAlready commented on TIG. Need variable positive/negative and HF start. You CAN scratch start and try to get by on pure AC but essentially it\u2019s going to suck. These \u201coptions\u201d make TIG much easier when it\u2019s already hard. With TIG the big advantage is ultimate control. You control the heat, filler material, and cleaning/welding. With a pure inert atmosphere small heat affected zone you can do so much with it. But it\u2019s also a three handed welding process. Foot pedal for current control, one hand on the gun, one on the filler rod. Staring at a tiny puddle. Sort of the polar opposite of MIG.\\nLots of comments too about what amounts mostly to Chinese made machines. I\u2019ll just say this. Miller, ESAB, and Lincoln are making them in the same factories.!i wish they bring it back here. There are quality differences to be sure. Lots of YouTube reviews pointing this out. But especially now that welders are mostly electronic (MOSFET, SCR or IGBT) build quality is drastically improving on the cheap machines. It\u2019s getting hard to ignore say an Eastwood when performance is as good as Lincoln and maybe ESAB. The downside is repairs.\u2019But that\u2019s less critical on a DIY machine compared to say a CAT mechanic. And less of a big deal for the weekend warrior compared to a guy that is welding 4-8 hours a day, 5+ days a week. Operating hours are drastically less.\\nThat being said, also suggest shopping used market. Not EBay. More like Craig\u2019s List. Ideal is to find a big expensive but older Miller or Lincoln but at the new Chinese made buzz box price. Don\u2019t discount looking at the welding supply shop either.\\nAgreed about Tweco. If you are unwilling to risk your purchase on Chinese made machine (Harbor Freight, Hobart, Everlast, Eastwood) and you\u2019d rather risk it on a machine made in China it\u2019s not a bad way to go.\\nAs far as Red, Yellow, and Blue, Red and Yellow lately have been coming down in price with some very competitive machines compared to the past. Blue is still crazy high.\\nAnother thing to think about. Priced a generator lately? Look at the price of an engine welder that just happens to have say a 20 kW generator as well. Often this is much cheaper than a dedicated generator. And often the wife will happily say yes to the generator when it was no to the welder. It\u2019s a win-win.
