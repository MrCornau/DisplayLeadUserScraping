Except how did you come across batteries that you could tear apart like that? I assume the batteries were unusable?\\nSent from my SCH-I535 using Tapatalk\\nI don\\'t know about other brands, but Ryobi batteries are held together with 6 screws. You can take the battery apart and get rid of the cells, then screw the shell back together. To attach them to the cabinet or shelf I just drill a couple of holes in the wood and throw a couple of screws down into the shell. The plastic is actually pretty strong for what it is, and if you screw them down tight the plastic doesn\\'t break...at least none of them have broken yet. Most of the tools are light enough that there\\'s not a lot of stress on the \"mount\", the only stuff that\\'s questionable if at all is the circular saws and the Airstrike nailer.\\nOf course it\\'s not foolproof, the old \"blue\" nailer/stapler won\\'t click-in onto a couple of the shells very well so I have to make sure I keep the right shell with that tool. Otherwise I have no issues, and it\\'s easy to put the tools onto the mounts and take them off one-handed.\\nThe only \"unusable\" thing about the batteries is that they\\'re NiCads, and when they\\'re dead they\\'re dead. Can\\'t really do anything with them besides rebuild them or toss them, and I wasn\\'t gonna spend the time, money, or effort to try and fix them. Sadly, like I said, I threw a bunch away.
