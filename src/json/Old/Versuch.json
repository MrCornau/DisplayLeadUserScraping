Is there a place that reviews those lenses and provides image samples. Buying random vintage lenses on eBay was always problem to me because I never know what I'm buying. If I'm buying new lens I know exactly what to expect just by knowing the specs, I don't have to see image samples. But since I'm buying vintage only for the specific look, I'd like to see samples. Any good place for this?"

You won't necessarily get better pictures from an M10-D over what you have now (except perhaps in low light situations) and you would be giving up all the benefits of a dedicated monochrom camera to boot.

      "content": "You could say that there are two possibilities: 1. You can buy lenses of the focal lengths that you like and apertures that you know you will use, or 2. You can buy lenses which you like the look and feel of (ergonomics) and learn to appreciate them. Either way works in my experience. I like some lenses because their field of view and aperture suit my way of taking photographs. I like others because of the way I interact with the camera and lens when using them - this is often an underestimated quality. If you have moved from a Canon dSLR then 2 may have significant sway with your decision making. Lastly, beware of buying too many lenses too soon. If you go through the forum you will find advocates for virtually every/any Leica M lens produced. See if you can go and -----> try !!!  a few at a dealer's and buy what you like, enjoy it and then look at others. Leica Ms have a learning curve which is part of the pleasure of owning and using them. Sometimes putting a lens aside then returning to it can remind you of its qualities.

I can easily get into that mind set by just simply setting my camera to monochrome mode. Just like when I used to chose to purchase black and white film. The difference is that with M10R, you are holding a color camera in your hand and can always choose to switch to color mode, either while shooting in preview or post. An advantage of using M10R for B&W is that you can adjust \"filters\" in the post, while with M10M, you must attach them when shooting. If possible, you should -----> try !!!  it out.

In this bag I can fit my M10 body with its lens attached plus 4 additional lenses (if needed; but its rarely needed). From Leica store I got little black bags to put the lenses in so that I can place one on top of the other (across the bag) not to scratch them. Finally there is a space for a spare battery including charger plus cable (Swiss sockets are very small and flat; a Euro socket would not fit). If I want to carry more comfortably all that equipment plus filters and other small equipment I use a Lowepro Flipside AW II. And finally when I go hiking and I use only 2 lenses (one on camera) then I put the second lens in a small pouch from PeakDesign (range pouch small).

The zip is plastic and I would take some real effort to scratch the camera with it. Nice feature is that you really seal it off with this zip. Disadvantagde, you are a bit slower with grabbing your gear. However, when I walk around with camera out/in, I only use the magnet flap. That gives very quick access. The XS and S are definitely not heavy. I used to have to Ona Bowery Leather. This felt too heavy for me. I also didn't like the stiffness of the leather. But the bag was beautiful to look at. So I have sold the Ona and changed for XS and S. Wotancraft gives more dividers, inside it feels better in details. About Billingham, you can't go wrong with those I think."

      "content": "Well: yes, the colors are different. Not that I'd notice without the side-by-side, but there's a change there in color that varies across the frame. The red or the brick, the blue of the sign, and the cloud shading are all different. The 21 Elmarit Asph is one of my favorite lenses and I've gone to lengths to make the most of it. When it comes to both color and luminance shading, lens-camera-aperture specific correction is hard to beat. Leica's in-camera correction is fantastic for get-the-job-done shooting, but maximum technical quality requires manual correction. (I use RawTherapee with a sequence of calibration shots made through a flash umbrella; the thickness of white plastic added enough luminance vignetting to be an issue. I'd prefer Capture One if I owned a current version. No idea about anything else.) I did \"code\" my 21mm with permanent marker a few years ago and that has worked reliably since, although I neither use/test that often nor change lenses frequently. So, buying uncoded doesn't mean forgoing automatic features. The main downside is that if you -----> try !!!  to sell it on, the next buyer will have the same concerns. Also worth checking: focus accuracy. My two Leica 21mm lenses both back-focused dramatically. One I could write off as a beat-up copy; the other, complete with Leica repair certificate, had no such excuse. But they differed by exactly -- precisely -- the same distance from the scale as each other. So, perhaps not an isolated thing: film era wide lenses focusing in the film rather than on its surface. I have no issues now, but it was a frustration and would be worth checking before buying. A plant/chair/post at 2m would show this clearly for me; not a small thing, not a hard test. Once you get the basics down, though, that 21mm Elmarit Asph has magic. Worth the hassle twice over, in my bag."

As well as unneeded material on either side & above so that what is being looked at can be more concentrated on. While, at the same time, maintaining a more or less normal perspective. This is 1 reason why when you go to a museum a lot of the portraits & landscapes look like they were painted with a 90mm lens. Unless you go to a Breughel exhibition.

For an experiencenced M user a 135 4.0 should present no difficulty at all focussing. In the 1960's and 1970's, for a while, my film Leicas were my main cameras, and while you'd never call me \"experienced\", I got so used to using the M2 and M3 that I didn't need to think about the camera, only about what I was photographing. Now it's all topsy-turvy, as I've been using Nikon for so long the M camera felt so strange in my hands. After ten days of using nothing but the M10, I learned zone focusing, and how to get the camera to do just what I thought I wanted. But, and this is a big \"but\", even something as simple as getting a GOOD photo of a rabbit became impossible because I couldn't get close enough. So, I did the best I could, but it meant cropping a tiny part of the image to show what I wanted. It was a very good ten days for me, as every day I went walking around hunting for something to photograph, and every night was spent with PhotoMechanic to get the image onto my laptop, and PhotoLab3 to -----> try !!!  to get the photo to look like what my brain \"saw\". Ain't no way I'm going to get a decent photo of an alligator if another one shows up in the drainage ditch in front of my brother's property, as I know how fast they can move, and I don't want to become alligator food. I didn't/don't want to spend multiple thousands of dollars on the latest Leica telephoto lens - spending a small fraction of that on a long Leica lens (which isn't technically a telephoto) sounded better. I also want to take photos of pelicans hunting for fish, and my 50mm photos had the same problem as with my rabbit. I want to fill the frame with what I'm photographing. Thank you for your reply - becoming an experienced M user is my goal, and that will never happen if I spend most of my time behind a Df or D750. --img-- "

I think you are much more realistic than I am. If I take my M with a lens or two, it gets to do anything I want, as best it can, or as best I can get it to do, just like my M2 with a 50 that I bought a lifetime ago. I just work around any limitations, again, as best I can. Maybe part of this is I really enjoy using it, and the challenge of getting it to do what I want. I wonder at times why I'm leaving my Nikon gear at home, and taking the Leica. It's hard to put things into words.

After reading your posts, I've got a LONG way to go, and I'll probably never catch up, but I never saw my M2 and M3 cameras as \"limitations\"; to me, they were capable of just about anything I wanted to do, but I needed to learn how to get them to do so.

Sorry for picking on the reset aspect. You are reporting it does not seem to do a thing. Well - it should. To check - change a setting you remember (e.g. JPEG sharpening or so), and then reset the camera as described in the manual p64. Edited August 26 by Photon42"

That's why I'm asking what is the M's future when the SL system is simply the best choice for the easiest and sharpest photo and with greater wide angle and telephoto usability? Last point, the SL f2.0 APO Summicrons also have very nice bokeh. Your thoughts. The same was said 55-60 years ago when SLRs (including the Leicaflex) took the world by storm. So long as the M has unique selling propositions (meaning it doesn't -----> try !!!  to chase the herd) and a \"sufficient\" market. it will soldier on. IF the M ever becomes a money-losing proposition for Leica, and they can't figure out an economics adjustment (as did Leitz Canada in 1977), then it may disappear. Since Leica is privately-held, only Leica knows the reality."

These will mean that an R will hold value pretty well for the next few years. It takes about a year for any discounts on a new Leica model to appear, so if you buy one now, you get the advantage of that year's use. There may be some magic going on in the highlight behavior. The basic operation of a digital sensor is that each photon that is captured creates the same number of electrons and the electrons accumulate up to a maximum, with a hard stop. My feeling is that Leica has softened that hard stop a bit, but I don't know yet at which step in the processing chain it happens."

Thank you Scott - I was -----> trying !!!  to be even handed, and I quite agree, the benefits in terms of image quality are the most important thing (not so much the 41mp - 24 was fine for me [I thought]) Generally speaking I get the first iteration of each Leica M upgrade (M9, M240, M10) and I just drool over the other variants, I was really intending to do the same with the M10, but the M10-R is enough of an upgrade to have shelled out again, and this is not any kind of whim - I've been running an M10-R test camera alongside my basic M10 for more than a year now, and I still wanted the M10-R! If you're going to buy secondhand - of course it's worth looking at a basic M10 or an M10-P, but if you're going to buy new, get an M10-R, it will hold it's value for longer, and you'll know you made the right decision! Good Luck!"

Thank you Scott - I was -----> trying !!!  to be even handed, and I quite agree, the benefits in terms of image quality are the most important thing (not so much the 41mp - 24 was fine for me [I thought]) Generally speaking I get the first iteration of each Leica M upgrade (M9, M240, M10) and I just drool over the other variants, I was really intending to do the same with the M10, but the M10-R is enough of an upgrade to have shelled out again, and this is not any kind of whim - I've been running an M10-R test camera alongside my basic M10 for more than a year now, and I still wanted the M10-R! If you're going to buy secondhand - of course it's worth looking at a basic M10 or an M10-P, but if you're going to buy new, get an M10-R, it will hold it's value for longer, and you'll know you made the right decision! Good Luck!"

      "content": "The eternal question: filter or no filter! I don't use any kind of filter on my lenses. I never did, but I use a lens hood instead for protection. If possible, all lenses go out of the house with a hood attached (also because it's easier to put it in the bag and not worry about scratching the first glass element. Cause I don't use a lens cap either. But... for example, if I shoot w/ the 35 Cron Asph I, and I take off the hood, wow. There is no VF blockage, and the 35mm FL is a joy to frame with. It gives me the (false) impression I have a more significant VF magnification. So, I want to -----> try !!!  to shoot with a protection filter on, but with no hood. To have more \"freedom\" and less Iq worry. I was thinking this: https://breakthrough.photography/products/x4-uv?variant=31478832593 They were expensive, but I read a lot, and they were really worth it. This would be my primary choice. 18 hours ago, pippy said: I'm another who always uses a filter when shooting outdoors. Always. I know there could / should be, in theory, some degradation in IQ but having done tests in the studio the reality, IMX, is that there is no noticeable difference so for me, as Paul said above, it's also a no-brainer. No experience with filters, but I think you resume it wisely. One can shoot all day long with the filter and not notice any IQ degradation. Agree, especially with nowadays modern glasses and coatings. Maybe it's about common sense. People can leave the filter on all day long until they are shooting against the sun or in difficult night situations; well, maybe it's time to remove the filter for a while. Just saying. . Big advantage of filters? First element protected, smaller package, and no VF blockage, which I think is critical. Edited September 27 by Dennis"

Just bought this China Made Desk top tripod as I left my Leica Desktop in Melbourne. Reason for the purchase decision? Apart from being very flexible - 3 height settings, well made and well priced (compared to the well known western Brands) I was shown a photo of an 85kg man standing on it despite the fact that it was only rated at 2kg. Also comes with a leather holster (looks like a pistol holster) This is my second Fotopro brand tripod. This first one is my TL74C with a Unique Ball head. This setup is stable enough for 25kg (if I'd remembered correctly) should be stable enough for my M10 --img--  Bought the optional hard case as well -good for transportation as check in luggage. My third tripod is a carbon fibre travel tripod weighing at only 600g. Lightest tripod I could find that has reasonable height. It is not very stable when fully extended. More useable with the centre column removed but I lose some height then. The other alternative is to use the 10 second timer to avoid shake caused by activating the shutter trigger. This only comes in a sling bag. Photos of the Fotopro tripods attached (Disclaimer: I have no association with any of the tripod brands mentioned) I've got a Gitzo G1327, Mefoto and leica desktop tripod. Have had the Gitzo with arca tech ballhead and leica for a long time. Got the mefoto for travel -----> trying !!!  to downsize and found it is not that stable when extended to full height. As you have found your to be the same way. You get what you pay for in some cases. I use use the gitzo more often than not when a tripod is needed. It's a little much to carry around, yet it is solid when it is put to use."

The point is that you can shoot the M10-R in brighter light conditions than the M10, M or M9. Without using ND filters. This wouldn\u2019t matter to everyone, but I often want to shoot with the lens wide open in very bright high contrast situations (generally people rather than boats!). The base ISO of the M10-R already gives you 1 stop advantage (100 vs M10\u2019s 200). In addition to this you can recover a lot more information than you can with the previous M cameras.

Well, basically the excuse he gave me was he popped out the SD card to review the images while out in CT (Fife and drum event), and then couldn't find the plate after. He didn't realize it was a big deal until he couldn't take anymore pictures. I'm hopeful that one of the other folks on the trip found it, but no luck so far. Lesson learned for him => review in the field using the Fotos App vs a computer, and whenever you take off a baseplate put it back on immediately so you don't carelessly lose it. Lesson for me perhaps loan him the CL instead. It looks like the Boston Leica Store has one, so I'm going to grab it later today."

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) Hello all! A lot of folks buy an M camera (and I suspect many new users as the M10 is fantastic) but are at a loss for a good set of lenses. I think it is beneficial to list some good setups. Not one les that is good but a combination of lenses to cover most shooting situations and why. I'll start with my most useful setup; I've taken into consideration price and lens character to make this assessment. In my mind, everything Leica M starts with the 50. Now, for the uninitiated, 50mm is the easiest focal length for manufacturers to make great. Tons and tons of choices. After -----> trying !!!  about everything, and given cost, my ideal minimum 50 setup is: Zeiss 50 f2 Planar AND 50 f1.5 Sonnar. Optimized to 1.5 Together about 2 grand. The planar is an amazing everyday 50. The Sonnar is incredible wide open. Now it gets tricky.... Wide: Voigtlander 21mm 1.9. Great lens. Mid range: a combo of lenses: 28 summilux (absolute favorite lens - outstanding optics and bokeh). Plus a 35: would choose Leica 35 summarit OR older Leica 35 pre aspherical Cron (like version IV) OR Voigtlander 35 mm color Skopar OR Zeiss 35mm 2.8 You've got wide and midrange. Now you know a zoom. My FAVORITE is 75 LUX However if cost is consideration, the 90 TELE-ELMARIT is inexpensive and fantastic. And small. My preference is going expensive with one lens (in my case the 28 Lux) and moderate on the others. My lenses: the 21 Voigtlander, the 28 Lux, 35 color Skopar, both Zeiss 50s and 90 tele elmarit is relatively inexpensive -- except the 28 lux-- and amazing all around. You could go 28 elmarit and save cash and have an awesome small in size lens setup. Rob Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

For those of you who own both of these lenses, what is the difference? I know that the CV is not 6-bit coded, but can I enter it's Leica equivalent manually via the menu? My other option would be to go for the Leica 35 and pick up a CV 50 APO Lanthar as my second lens. Thoughts? Thanks -Brad Avoid the 35mm Summicron-M (11673) if you can, unless you really like flare. Even then, avoid it, because it's not worth the $4,000. Earlier this year I was looking to get my very first 35mm lens because 28mm felt too wide, but I couldn't decide which Leica lens to get. I wasn't even sure if I would find the 35 focal length appealing, so I decided to -----> try !!!  the Voigtlander Color-Skopar 35mm f/2.5 before spending too much money. Funny enough, I did end up enjoying the Voigtlander, mainly because of its small size and decent quality. There are some aberrations if you know what to look for, but overall it's decent, specially at that price point. So, I decided I liked the 35mm focal length enough to buy a brand new 35mm Summicron-M (11673). By this point, I had the 28mm Summicron (11672), which is an absolutely awesome lens (which at the time I didn't know and ended up selling it, and yes I do regret it \ud83d\ude14). In my mind, the 35mm Summicron-M (11673) was going to be a similar lens in quality as the 28mm Summicron (11672) except the longer focal length, but boy was I wrong. One of the first things I noticed immediately with the 35mm Summicron (11673) was the flaring. I shoot a lot of high-contrast night scenes, and it always produced flares. Even the smallest source of light in the frame would produce flare. And the flare was the really ugly kind, the UFO looking flare that's really distracting. With the Skopar I never got flares, except when shooting directly at the sun, and If there was flare, it was barely noticeable. I contacted the dealer and asked him TWICE and very directly about the flare issue, and in both cases he dodged the question (in fact he just ignored them, which was a bit weird TBH). So I decided to contact Leica USA. After analyzing my DNG files, their camera and lens experts told me that they had never seen such flaring with the 35mm Summicron-M (11673), but they also recommended that I contact Leica Germany, which I did. Leica Germany told me that the flare is not unusual with the 35mm Summicron-M, and that I do not have a bad copy. To me that kind of flaring is an unacceptable flaw, specially for a $4,000 lens, so I decided to return it. As it turns out, the 28mm Summicron-M (11672) is a very modern lens (2015, IIRC), whereas the 35mm Summicron-M (11673) is some twenty years old. You mentioned that this is going to be your first lens, and since you're open to a 50mm, I would highly recommend 50mm Summilux-M. That lens is pure magic."

I consider this feature not workings as it was not possible to get any reliable or any reputable results, about 97 out of 100 attempts provided the \"Image Inhomogeneous\" message, and I -----> experimented !!!  with 3 deferent lenses as well as very bright and other backgrounds too. If You are using an M10-R and not experiencing these results, perhaps I have an M10-R with an issue, but I will wait to see of other M10-R users chime in about this."

      "content": "I also cannot get dust detection to work. I posted about the same issue on July 23rd, and received no reply. Here is that earlier post :- Like others, I am delighted with the M10-R. I also proudly/humbly take pride in finding an area where the M10-R falls short relative to the M10. It is - drumroll! - Dust Detection. The reason I -----> tried !!!  the camera\u2019s Dust Detection capabilities is not because I am anal and think this is the best use for an M10-R. Rather, it is because Jaapv once posted that a new camera\u2019s shutter curtain may shed oil, specks and suchlike onto the sensor when first used. I decided to check how clean the sensor was, and to monitor if it changed. Dust detection on the M10 was simple. It involved finding any smooth and homogeneous surface and taking a defocussed image of it. Given its significant increase in resolution, the M10-R is more likely than the M10 to see minute irregularities in the image as dust on the sensor. Consequently it seems to have more rigorous dust detection logic and is more demanding of dust detection images. Whenever I found a surface which seemed uniform and uniformly lit, I took a defocussed Dust Detection image. I have yet to take an image which does not yield the warning \u201cimage inhomogeneous.\u201d I would be interested in learning whether other M10-R users have had more success than I have had. The M10-R may have advanced dust detection capabilities, but they are useless if they reject every test image. This is trivial and does not detract from my delight in the camera, but is an area where Leica could do some work. Perhaps two grades of dust detection - Medium and High?"

Thanks for posting your results, i have used that and many other methods through experimentation, as i have in the past with other M cameras, but i am not getting it to work on my M10-R and do have the latest firmware as well. Since you are getting different (and better) results, the problem might be isolated to affect only some of the production runs. It will become more clear if it is isolated or widespread if more users post about it."

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) With all the expectation building up for M11, I've just obtained a new M9-P (checked, certified, re-sensored, re-leathered, re-packaged and warranted by Leica). The CCD interest was building up since I got the M9M last year (after M10M) and saw the crisp and unique rendering for myself. The last straw was @Stuart Richardson's thoughts in the Best Digital Leica of 15 Years thread here. I'm also a Leica S fan, as Stuart, and was considering S 006 for the same rendering. However, with the future of S uncertain and travel easier with the Ms, and only one new M9-P left in the world, it was a time to -----> try !!! . I must say the difference is striking. The difference between M9 and M10 is much more than M10 and M10R. Since M11 will bring new bells and whistles, perhaps the controversial EVF (boo), but not CCD rendering, I think M9 after M10 is much more revolutionary than the evolutionary path up. This forum is famous for valuing such aspects as Leica look, and I submit that the variety of the Leica look that an M9 brings is more than anything that M11 will. And here people like screenless and monochrome cameras, again quite unique in the world. So you don't always have to go up. You can go down too! As I was standing on a platform at Princeton Junction one day years ago, a Princeton freshman asked me, \"Which way is the city?\" To which I, a Philadelphia fan, answered, \"which city\"? Even when everyone is headed to New York, Philadelphia has its charms. Similarly, M9 may be \"smaller,\" but small is beautiful (Unix philosophy). M9-P with 50mm Summilux --img-- "

The lens had already been converted to Nikon mount years ago. $24 seemed ok for an experiment. Looking for a trial subject, I found a white linen handkerchief 6 feet or two meters away and lit by a large window. Did one exposure in the center and refocused with it on the edge, magnified image for each. Image in Capture One is incredible! I can easily count the individual threads from a subject 6 feet away. To be sure this is a tripod set up/procedure only unless you have the electronic viewfinder which I do not have. Outdoors I would use the dark cloth from my view camera. until I decide I require it.

I mostly document the everyday dailies with my kids (8, 5 and 3), documentary-style. I also shoot weddings and portraits professionally (15+ years) with a Fuji X-T3 and X100V kit. I'm growing tired of -----> trying !!!  to \"choose\" a camera to take out. If I bring out the MD-262, but I need to shoot in low-light, I'll wish I had the M246. If I bring out the M246, but it's bright, I'll figure that the good-light performance is/was the same and wish I had the MD-262 for colour. But if I bring out the MD-262, I love the screenless shooting experience. And if I bring out the M246, I love the intentional B&W shooting. And then sometimes I think - damnit - I don't wanna think and I'll just bring the Q. But then I wear sunglasses and hate how the EVF looks with my polarized shades. ... Ugh. First world problems, I know. So I'm thinking of consolidating my MD-262 and M246 for an M10, M10-P or M10-R (or hell - even an M10-D). My thought process is that the body is closer to that of my M6 (more comfortable), the low-light performance is better than my MD-262 and probably even equivalent to that of my M246. Am I right? Does it simplify my options? Always bring out just that 1 camera instead of having paralysis by analysis? I don't need the 40MP in the M10-R, but if it offers better low-light performance, I can put up with it. Who's shot both the M10 (or M10-P) and the M10R? Other than resolution, talk to me about the difference between the two. Not necessarily tech specs - but - what did you enjoy mire about one or the other? How were the colours? How were the B&W conversions? How was the low-light performance? Or should I just shut off the \"bruno\" in my head (from Disney's Luca - my kids love it) and stick with what I have but be more decisive?

      "content": "Just to be clear, there is compression (which keeps the full number of pixels and resolution (e.g. 40 million pixels from the M10-R), but stores the data more efficiently and perhaps with slightly different tonal distinctions). And there is downsampled (S or M) Raw - which reduces the number of pixels (i.e. resolution) by downsampling - and then stores that lower-rez picture in a RAW envelope (i.e. leaving WB, sharpening, etc for the photographer to adjust as desired in post-processing.) Both will reduce file size - but s/mRAW reduces the actual resolution and number of pixels, while compression does not. I -----> experimented !!!  with Canon's sRAW1 from a 21 Mpixel 5D2 - and got 9 Mpixel .RAW images instead of the whole 21 Mpixels the sensor could provide. SRAW2 delivers 5.2 Mpixel pictures. That is a lot of fine detail thrown away - but it isn't necessarily required for some pictures, so it is a worthwhile option to have available. Leica has gone back and forth on using compression on their RAW format (Adobe's .DNG file type) over the years. Some cameras always compress the .DNG files (plain vanilla M10), some never do (Monochroms?), and some have allowed a user choice (M8?, M9? - I forget which). In all cases the number of Mpixels stayed the same, with or without compression. For 84Bravo: The plain M10 compresses (losslessly) all .DNGs, with no user option for uncompressed .DNGs. Not sure about the M10-R and M10-M cameras. I agree with Photoworks that the file size of 40 megabytes (from 40 megapixels - but don't confuse them) implies some compression to all .DNGs already. ...................... It has been suggested (but not by Leica - yet) that the hypothetical M11 will have 1) a 60 Mpixel sensor, with 2) a user option for downsampled .DNGs like s/mRAW (converted to fewer pixels) - i.e. the user will be able to shoot in .DNG but have the option of getting full 60 Mpixel files, or (for example) 24 Mpixel or 15 Mpixel images, as their needs require. That would actually be a plus for me. I would have been happy to stick with the M9's 18 Mpixels forever (with the other improvements of the M10: ISO, new VF/RF, smaller dimensions). And for journalistic work (as used to be done with Tri-X), even 15 Mpixels would be perfectly acceptable, 90% of the time. s/mRAW (or s/mDNG) is a good way for little old Leica to simulate Sony's Alpha7, Alpha 7s and Alpha 7r - without having to make three separate cameras with three different sensors. Landscapers, general shooters and photojournalists can all get what they need out of one body, just by making a selection in the menu. EDIT - it should be noted that Adobe software (Camera Raw) will recompress .DNG images (since it is their own proprietary format) - if and when a picture is opened for post-processing and then saved. Once. For example, an M10 image file I have not yet worked on in Adobe Camera Raw may have a file size on disk of 30 megabytes. But once I have made adjustments and saved them, the file size will be, say 24.46 megabytes. After that, it will stay at 24.46 megabytes forever. I have a feeling Adobe removes Leica's own in-camera compression, and substitutes its own thereafter - a minor savings is disk space. Edited August 26 by adan"

      "content": "I had one of these in the early days of the M10. The possible mechanicals difficulties on a digital Leica are: 1) as the name suggests, with dual ranges, the DR has two separate focusing cam surfaces (on one cylindrical cam). Using the long-distance range (1m > infinity) the closeup cam, now in the bottom of the lens, can jam or rub against the meter housing on the floor of the M10 shutter chamber as one focuses close to infinity. In my case, this happened only in the last fraction of a mm before reaching infinity, and it did not completely jam; the focusing just got a bit stiffer (and the lens left a little rub-mark inside the M10). 2) The close-up goggles won't always clip completely into place, unless the little black rubber \"bumper\" on the back of the goggles is trimmed to fit (see your picture, black bumper is just peeking over the top, above and behind the words \"Leitz Wetzlar.\" To focus closer than 1 meter, the goggles MUST be mounted on the lens (they unlock the close-focus action by pressing on the \"ball bearing\" on top of the lens mount - see your photo). The whole point of the DR lens and goggles is to focus close using the regular rangefinder and no other accessories. But it can be used with live-view or EVF - still needs the goggles mounted, though, to unlock the closeup range. It is also a bit heavier than most M 50mm f/2s, due to the 1950s build-quality, and the extra metal for extended focusing. At normal focusing distances (1m > infinity) I found the DR to be at least as good, and often better, than more modern 50mm Summicrons - at f/2.0. Stopped down, the differences decrease. Certainly for a 1950s design, it holds up extremely well with age. I.E. I mostly agree with Rockwell's evaluation. In the close range, as with most lenses designed for longer distances, it is a bit soft at f/2.0, but very sharp stopped down. I used mine in the studio and for other close-range work for a couple of months - and still sell prints from some of its images. But I'm not excited by \"old stuff\" just for its own sake, and ultimately a 75mm Summarit f/2.4 gave me tighter cropping and equal resolution with less fiddling around with goggles and \"gear changes\" on the lens.

Although the evf doesn\u2019t give the same rangefinder experience, I find it easier to focus with evf and magnifying than ovf, especially when shooting at low light or complex subject. In terms of lenses, I have the following: 35mm sim micron 7 elements noctilux 50 1.0 v3 summilux 50 1.4 asph summicron 90 2 apo asph With my poor eyesight, the only lens I\u2019m comfortable with while using the ovf is the 50 1.4asph. I cannot fully see the 35mm frame line, and the 90mm is like a sniper scope. Recently a friend asked me if I want to switch my m10 with his sl2s in addition with some cash. I\u2019m not considering any sl lenses in the near future, so probably just using a adapter along with my m lenses. however, I\u2019m not really sure if the better electronic system and better evf will justify the additional weight and bulky body of a sl? any kind of input is appreciated! thanks"

      "content": "Lots of good advice on here. While I appreciate the qualities of the SL2, to me personally, it is moving back towards other DSLRs and new mirrorless systems. I love the manual feel of the M range along with the size and I suspect from OP's post that they feel the same way. I occasionally puck up one of my other systems and enjoy the relative simplicity but after a little while (10-30mins) I miss the ritual and process of my M. I too am short sighted and have adjusted to the RF window for the most part while wearing my glasses. I use my Visoflex 020 for my 90 and 21 lenses but I miss the optical viewfinder. I just bought an optical VF for my 21mm to partially rectify this. The battery life when using the 020 drops significantly. Hopefully the new Visoflex will be a significant improvement in terms of size, resolution, and battery drain (I always wonder how much the built in GPS function of the 020 adds to the drain). -----> Try !!!  the SL2 for a few days and see how you feel. I believe you will miss your M and that there's a good reason why your friend is wanting to make the switch. That being said, all love to SL2 shooters who prefer that system."

The RRS is, in no particular order, heavier, top quality, more expensive, no more available. The kameracraft is not really less expensive, but provides a quick access to battery and SD card and has an integrated Arca profile, two features I use frequently, the grip not being honestly ugly but not smart for my taste. The main weakness of the Kameracraft is the absence of eyelet that let the grip move if not tightened. The Tse Hsiao Chung's model looks like the Kameracraft specially the wooden grip and the battery acces, but the Arca profile is on a spare piece a choice that I don't find appropriate. On the other hand it will be more stable with the eyelet. Because of the manufacturing choices it is more expensive. As said above by elmars it comes a bit late, and may be for 3/100mm it won't fit the oncoming M11. Luigi's could be perfect for me with a grip and the Arca profile, and a secure locking system."

      "content": "20 hours ago, Adam Bonn said: Firstly, apologies for this - I've not much to say, but no doubt will take quite a while (and words) to do so! I came to Leica in 2017, I'd long fancied an M9 but it was a big outlay financially. They announced that they'd be ceasing the free sensor replacement which I figured wouldn't help them get any cheaper (if they'd had the new sensor) and wouldn't make them a safe bet if they hadn't. So the time was now (well then, aw you get what I mean) A low mileage official dealer supplied example came up at the right time and as they say on forums such as this I pulled the trigger Now truth be told I expected to use the M9 a bit like a classic sports' car (not that I own one) - sunny Sunday drives down country lanes, with a modern practical car for everyday. Long story short, I quickly became seduced by using a rangefinder, the cerebral challenges of a simple camera, and well boy meets Leica M - a story as old as the hills. My other brand cameras were relegated to the gear cupboard and the M9 and I partied like it was 2009 Of course the M9 does have some limitations, and I found myself wanting and needing something a little more modern for certain things. Enter the M240. I bought this camera because it was comparatively cheap, and had more ISO which I needed. Whereas I quite liked the 240, I never loved it. I found it quite hard work. Sure it performed better than the M9 with DR and ISO and I was glad of that. But the files needed more work in post, the camera was less nice in the hand and well.. we got on well enough but but it wasn't love I decided to see what the M11 did to M10 prices on the used market. About a month later my local AD got a secondhand M10 in, factory refurbished with new top and bottom plates (I don't want to know why it needed those....), the so important to me, warranty and at a price that was merely excruciating rather than terminal. I bounced into the store as they opened and... ...no M10 Sold? Nope - reserved for someone. You'll have to wait a week to see if I can sell to you It was a long week, that ended with a mad dash across the city to catch the store before closing. (Guy it was reserved for ended up buying a new m10R instead) I had a couple of DMs from folks asking about the whole M9/240/M10 comparison thing (which I've replied too), so that's not really what this missive is and besides that's all been done before I think? Also of course the early and mid adopters of the M10 have already shared their reviews and thoughts, so possibly I've little to add of value. But that said! I'm really very happy with the M10! My first concern was the reduced battery life compared to the 240.. well it is less, but as I'm not much of a chimper, tend to switch my camera off between shots, don't own the EVF, seldom use live view and can't be bothered to install the phone app thing = my battery life is great \ud83d\ude01 Usually about 650-750 shots. The headline feature of the M10 is that it's thinner. I'm genuinely surprised at how much I notice this and how much better it feels in my hand than the 240 (I have small hands) - of course the weight distribution helps here too, the M10 has better balance than the 240 (less front heavy, and mass concentrated into a smaller area feels more nimble, it's a technique used in sports motorcycle design) The next headline feature (I guess) is the improved viewfinder. I didn't notice this in the store, but it's tangibly bigger and easier to use. I don't wear glasses, but I do wear sun glasses a lot and it's a lot nicer to use wearing them, 35mm framelines work better for me too. But I guess the key upgrade reason was the ISO improvements and what the internet seems to have dubbed the colour science Lets start with the ISO. This is easy. Yeah it's a ton better. And not just more ISO less noise better, but more exposure push in post, image doesn't end up with more banding than a field of Zebras better. Massive score IMO Re colours.. well when I go through my LR catalogue thumbnails it's not always completely obvious if I'm looking at a M10 or 240 shot... the colours are not poles apart, but I find the M10 DNGs nicer to work on, there's a lot of pleasing (to me) pop and contrast and bite from the off. Skins tones of the people I shoot look better to me (and them) too. In fact a custom DCP and a preset with a little contrast gets me most of the way there during DNG import, personally (OMMV) I found the 240 images were a lot more case by case with different images needing quite separate types of work to get what I liked. This was the main thing I missed from the M9 (which I still have) with the 240. It was just how the M9 images usually arrived pretty close to being usable (or completely useless), whereas always the 240 demanded work (obviously YMMV, you may use different tools or the same tools in a better way) In fact I've little to complain about with the M10 (well the price \ud83d\ude44) and of course all the things that you've read on here already, the too stiff to lift ISO dial, the missing (for me, YMMV) cont/timed modes on the power switch (especially as timed isn't retained if you power off) - menu diving isn't what I associate with Leica... There's only really one fly in my personal M10 ointment (which I knew about before I bought it, not complaining too heavily, honest) Who's clucking bright idea was it too make base ISO inaccessible? WTAF? As you all know, you face a choice ISO 100 and don't dare clip a highlight or ISO 200 and hope the shadows aren't too murky if you need to recover them heavily Which, to me at least, makes ISO selection important for scenes where frankly it should be set base and forget (a colour RAW histogram might help here too...) But I can't stress enough... the camera is a tool, they all have foibles and we need to learn to use them to get what we want. So in some sort of summary The M10 compared to the M9. There's only one M9. The M10 isn't like an M9 v2.0 or something. It's just closer than the 240 was. The M9 colours are great and everything, but for me the M9 magic is the tonality, the glowing colours and airy light pictures. The M10 compared to the M240 On paper there's very little in it, but sincerely all those little improvements really do add up. The IQ is tangibly better, the ISO is far more usable, and it's just a nicer object to hold and use. (Which is important, cars get bought cos of the spec - they get sold if they're uncomfortable to drive) The M10 compared to the M11 ahahaha just messing - ask Jono or someone And that's the thing... Soon enough arrives the M11 Many here will get one, and I guess some you will use the opportunity to get an M10... Getting a camera that's not a current model has more than just price benefits... the firmware is mature, manufacturing bugs should be eliminated and the forums are full of tips and tricks for getting the most out of it written by people that have shot with one for some years If you've sat on the fence about the M10 and are figuring that now might be the time to jump, well I sincerely believe that you'll be happy with it. I know I am Thanks for reading. Just curious... did you not consider SL2 or SL2-S with superior sensor over M10. Why M10 over SL models? I -----> tried !!!

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) I imagine that although each one of us lives his own doubts as if they were unique, surely many in this group have gone through the same doubts, and have made good and bad decisions. In my presentation in the forum I already mentioned it, but since surely few saw it, I will repeat some things as context for my doubt. I started taking photographs as a child, with analog cameras of my father that I no longer remember. I learned the basics of analog development as a teenager (I am currently close to 50) and after a long history about 20 years ago I was increasingly opting for Canon digital ones. From a cheap Canon EOS to full frame 5D, 5DII, 6D, 5DIII and some nice L lenses etc\u2026. A few years ago, rather due to the need for a small business, I needed a smaller camera that would record good video, so I opted for a Sony A7RII, thinking that in addition to making good videos it would have a higher resolution than what I knew so far. From that moment I discovered the wonder of mirrorless cameras, basically because of the possibility of using any lens, from the oldest and rarest to the most modern\u2026. that led me to the leica world ... and once I had some R's and a couple of M's, curiosity led me to -----> try !!!  more and more alternatives. All this at the same time led me to buy my first analog camera in many years\u2026 a leicaflex to use my R lenses\u2026. and go back to the dark room of my childhood ... and since I was developing my own negatives why not the medium format ... and buy a Mamiya, and since I love the medium format why not hasselblad .... And since I have M lenses that have cost me an arm and a leg, why not an M body, and then a Leica M3 and then a Leica M9\u2026. I imagine this is a story known to many\u2026. well then \u2026. I currently have an M3, an M9, an X2, a Licea CL analog and a Leica CL digital, all my Canon cameras, all my canon lenses, several Ricohs, analog and digital, an Olympus 35, a Nikon FE2, a Canon A1, one Minolta quartz two Hasselblad (500 EXL and 501 CM). Needless to say about the lenses\u2026 but in a leica M mount a 50 Summicron v3, a 50 Summicron v4, a 90 Elmerit tele M, an old 90 mm f4, a 35 mm Sumaron 3.5, several Voitglanders, several 7Artisan and TTArtisan\u2026. etc etc etc \u2026\u2026 The point is that I love my cameras and my lenses, I use them all, but the experience of the Leica M and my question\u2026 to conclude\u2026 is\u2026. should I sell some cameras and lenses to buy a hopefully unused Leica m10R and a pair of M lenses or should I sell my Rolex (which I hardly ever use) to buy a Leica M10R and some lenses\u2026. I know I'm being funny\u2026 .. but this is really my dilemma\u2026 .. I know they will tell me that only I can know and that it depends on what I want\u2026. maybe the only answer to that is\u2026. I want to stop at least for a while looking for the perfect image and rest assured knowing that I have the perfect camera and the perfect lenses and that if I don't take better photos, as always it's just because I'm not close enough ..."

I'm at a loss to explain why it works now and didn't at the beach. My only thought is it might have something to do with switching between the LCD and the Visoflex (if indeed switching occurs, not sure) and somehow in bright sunlight the Visoflex can't detect when I put my eye to it. I'll run some more tests, but just wanted you to know you're in \"good company\"."

      "content": "To the OP: I bought a Visoflex for my M10 last December, brand new from B&H. I tested it out indoors when I first got it, everything was fine. I then put it and the camera away until today (my photography urge is cyclical); I took the Visoflex, M10 and, among others, a 90mm Summarit out to a beach fair to get some pictures. All I got when I -----> tried !!!  to use the Visoflex was a gray screen. No amount of hitting the \"LV\" button, turning the M10 on and off, removing and reinserting the Visoflex or similar machinations would get it to work.

      "content": "Well, thanks for the information, I appreciate it. As I say, the Visoflex (and, in fact, the M10) is like new. I had only tested it out briefly when I bought it. Having it work fine when I -----> tried !!!  it out at home has me thinking the malfunction has something to do with the fact that it was extremely sunny at the beach. Maybe I wasn't careful to get my eye close enough to the Visoflex eyepiece or maybe the heat caused it to malfunction or maybe the switch in the Visoflex that detects when you are looking through it is faulty. I don't know, I've got another event this Saturday at which I can test things out; if I have the same problem then it will have to go back to Leica."

While -----> trying !!!  to think of something the analog M does better than the digital M10, I was unable to, until I went out shooting. There is one very important function the analog Ms do better than any digital M.

However, with the digital M on, I have to wait for the digital rangefinder to wakeup before I can snap the picture. There is a better chance of perhaps missing the decisive moment with the digital rangefinder. What work around do some of you use to avoid missing the decisive moment? Edited May 27, 2020 by Joe T"

As I said before, I've been shooting my M3 and M6s several days a week for over a decade, so in order to change that behavior, it's going to require practice. Great camera though, it has exceeded all of my expectations so far. Welcome to the forum Joe T, I echo Jeff S, Adan and others who gave similar feedback. One way to think of it is that with our film Ms we cock the shutter right after each shot and with our digital Ms we cock the shutter just before each shot. In either case muscle memory kicks in very quickly and it becomes second nature. I have found the M10 to be the most responsive of the digital Ms to date. One quick tip that you may already know - -----> try !!!  not to delete images in camera as it turns to slow down the wake up time. Happy to explain why if needed but would rather not drone on..."

Ive hopped onto the SL2 earlier in the year,............................................... I cant help but feel its not giving me the same experience I got from the M. I also find it too heavy as a system to carry for long hikes and trips and I really miss the M at those times. Similar situation. I recently bought into my 4th medium format system. I understand heavy The reason I really want to upgrade are: 3) Ability to crop with higher MP so I could travel with just a 35mm and maybe a 90mm Been -----> experimenting !!!  with such a thing myself. I used an M240 and a 28, 50, and a 90 the last time we went to France. Much more pleasant than a pro body Nikon and three pro zooms. We do mostly castles, cathedrals, ruins, that sort of thing. 24mp was sufficient for the things I wanted to crop, but not enough for architectural details.

I used an M240 and a 28, 50, and a 90 the last time we went to France. Much more pleasant than a pro body Nikon and three pro zooms.

When each of them is apparently fully charged using the standard Leica charger, the in-camera battery status reading for one of them returns \u2013 100%. The second battery returns a reading of 85%. It doesn't matter how long you leave the battery in the charger, the charger's charging lights are fixed but the camera returns a reading of 85%. You might -----> try !!!  \"calibrating\" the battery - run that battery right down to as close to 0% as you can, through regular use, and/or leaving it in the camera with the LCD on, and the camera set to \"never sleep\" until the camera shuts down due to low battery power. Then recharge it with the Leica charger and see what happens. BTW - since someone else is sure to mention it - that is not a \"good\" practice for every day, since done repeatedly and often, it will shorten the battery life. Modern Li-ions prefer being \"topped up\" from partial charge. But not a big deal to do once, if a battery is acting up anyway. If that doesn't work, the battery may simply be reaching end-of-life. Which is usually approximately 300-500 charge-discharge cycles. I had one M9 battery that eventually refused to charge more than 90% under any condition, as reported by the camera. That was after 6-7 years of recharging every few days. \"Recalibrating\" didn't work. Bought a new battery. As to why the Nite-Core may seem to work - could just be different settings in its safety circuits. It's willing to \"push\" the lithium ions back into place harder or longer. In the long run, that may not be a good thing. https://batteryguy.com/kb/knowledge-base/why-dont-lithium-ion-batteries-last-forever/"

If this does not happen, you may need to reset camera (Remove battery after reset, wait 10-20 secs, and then reset again). Don't know why, but it works with Wifi routers. One WiFi is enabled, you will see this network on any computer (Mac, Windows, iPhone). If you still don't see the WiFi network, the problem is with the camera, not FOTOS.. Open Fotos on iPhone.

You can turn them on and off and also adjust the threshold values. The direction pad issue could indicate a hardware problem and also the WiFi issue could be hardware-related. Firmware/memory corruption is another possibility. Any chance that your M10 has been exposed to a very strong electromagnetic field of some sort? Regarding the WiFi issue, the only additional thing I would suggest is to check the WiFi for possible nearby strong networks on the same channel. I'm not sure if the M10 can change channel in that case. With a WiFi analyser you should also see the M10 network if it has managed to create one. Good news on that first part. The direction pad problem is a brand new thing that has happened after following the steps from @rramesh above. As for electromagnetic fields. It was shipped to New York from the West Coast \u2014 that's all I can really say. Not sure if there are fields like that during transport.

You should know that sending the camera back to leica Germany will mean months of waiting. you should anyway go true leica local service or store to avoid shipping cost and export taxes. Personally unless it is a pixel mapping issue I is probably a repair . I would do tests at all ISO setting and see when it will show up and not show up.

Thank you so much for taking time to reply! I'm relieved to hear that your camera's warranty is still in effect - the fix may be something as simple as a firmware upgrade or pixel remapping. If a sensor replacement is needed, that would be very expensive if you had to pay for it yourself. Quote ...In Continental Europe August is traditionally holiday month and most business run with reduced workforce, chances of getting regular service are slim until September... Unfortunately there will be a long wait for warranty service on your camera. Unless installing a firmware upgrade at home fixes the problem, there is no way around sending the camera in to Wetzlar and waiting. This is one of the reasons I would not buy a used digital M camera. A used film M or M lens is different altogether. With a digital body, there can be problems such as this lurking in the camera, waiting to come out and cause you grief. Live and learn... Edited July 15 by Herr Barnack"

Why would I want to upgrade to the M10-R at this point, aside from the increased dynamic range that the R offers? I was torn between acquiring an M10-R, or grabbing a NIB M10-P at a great price. I really think for most of my work, 24MP is more than enough. I was dreading having to upgrade my computer to handle 40+ MP files. I went with the M10-P, which will cut down on lens changing now that I have two M10-P bodies, one chrome and one black. This will be very welcome for travel when I can keep the WATE on one camera and a 35 or 50 on the other camera, or maybe even the MATE.

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) Hi everyone, I'll be moving away from my 12 year old Canon body and wanted a camera to use everyday. Given this requirement, I was keen on checking out the M10 with a 35 summicron. I recently -----> tried !!!  this setup at a Leica store and really liked the compact RF setup. As an everyday camera, size/weight is definitely really important and this is one area the M system shines. However, I can't quite get over the fact that the skill set of the M is a little limited. A mirrorless camera will allow me to also dabble in the limited landscape/wildlife stuff I do whenever I travel. The SL2 S seems to be a camera which can do most things pretty well though it may not be the best as a camera to use during general day to day stuff. In the future (say in 1-3 years), I see myself having an M and a mirrorless due to their vastly different abilities but right now, I need to think about where to start. I think that a practical approach would be to start with a SL2 S and use an M 35 summicron with it. This would not be too large a setup and the SL system would allow me to use some other lenses for landscape or wildlife as the need arises. I've heard that the BSI sensor on the SL2 S is also really good and it would really excel in many scenarios. In a while (maybe when the M11 launches?), I could potentially get an M body and thereby have the best of both worlds. But as it stands today, I need to decide between the M10 + 35 summicron vs SL2 S + M 35 summicron and would love to hear your thoughts (both options are around 8k-9k USD). Any other suggestions are also welcome. I haven't used the SL2 S but how does it behave as an EDC with small M glass? Even if the size isn't too much more, does the extra weight (930 gms vs 660 gms for the M10) pose challenges? Is the M10 sensor dated now and am I better off waiting for a bit? Please let me know what you think! Cheers!"

Handling is better with small M glass than native L-mount lenses but you\u2019ll still notice the weight of the body as compared to an M10. Also, most M glass, especially <50mm will not perform as well on the SL2-S as compared to on an M body, despite what Leica -----> tries !!!  to tell you. I definitely prefer the weight and size of the M10 over the SL2-S. 4 hours ago, bernabei said: Even if the size isn't too much more, does the extra weight (930 gms vs 660 gms for the M10) pose challenges? If I can only choose to reduce either weight or size of the SL2-S, I would want to reduce the weight. The size is not really that big of a deal, at least for me. I actually like the ergonomics and a lot of that has to do with the size and how things are laid out. It\u2019s the weight that\u2019s most noticeable to me. It balances well with larger L-mount lenses but it\u2019s still a heavy body and going with an M prime or even APO SL prime helps to reduce the total weight but even a 100g triplet lens on the SL2-S still requires a ~200g M-adapter L which, combined, is as much as a 35mm FLE! In short, the 930g SL2-S will become a 1.13kg (2.5lbs) body even without a lens when using an M-adapter L. Add a 255g 35mm Summicron-M ASPH and you\u2019re at 1.38kg (3lbs). An M10 with the same lens will be 915g (2lbs), so the SL2-S setup will weigh 50% more which is instantly noticeable. 4 hours ago, bernabei said: Is the M10 sensor dated now and am I better off waiting for a bit? Depends on what you need. If you don\u2019t need more resolution, then it will never be \u2018out of date\u2019 for you. If you are not doing any \u2018available darkness\u2019 photography or astrophotography where you need very low noise, very high ISO, long exposures, then the sensor will never be \u2018out of date\u2019. For any daytime or indoor photography, the M10 sensor is more than sufficient. 5 hours ago, bernabei said: In a while (maybe when the M11 launches?), I could potentially get an M body and thereby have the best of both worlds. If the M11 is anything like the M10, you\u2019ll need to wait a while to get one unless you have a very good relationship with your Leica dealer and you put a deposit down before the camera gets released. The few rumors that indicate a Nov 11 announcement also mention that it will be a few months before initial availability and like most Leica M bodies, they will be in high demand with limited supply for another 12-18 months after it hits the market."

I\u2019ve -----> tried !!!  it many times, and even took it into a Leica store (in LA) to see if they could get any further. Alas, nothing much. It\u2019s not that it never works, but that it often fails to connect, so much that I\u2019ve just convinced myself that the wifi feature does not really exist. \ud83d\ude09 Happily, once I just decided to treat the SD card as a roll of film that I have to remove in order to get the photos, everything\u2019s been fine. I was able to get a connection to the Fotos app to do a little customization of the settings when I first got the camera 1.5 years ago, but have never felt any need to change them since."

Seems, with your camera something is wrong, probably you better ask the Leica service in Wetzlar.

All was going well until I realized I have more highlight latitude in Lightroom than I do with C1. 1 - 100 in LR shows a significant amount of latitude in comparison to C1. I can bring them down almost entirely, but with C1 they just become flat, and \u201cmattish\u201d in appearance. Very ugly looking end result. C1 seems to have finer details after interpolation though, and as a result are also sharper. I\u2019ve also noticed there\u2019s more noise too, perhaps a trade off, but I prefer the noise structure more in LR. I hope they continue to improve C1 to work better with Leica.

Did you read that on the Internet? Not remotely the case with my M10r, or Canon equipment. I prefer C1 with GFX and XF, as it\u2019s really dialled in there. But Leica is using Adobe\u2019s proprietary DNG format so I\u2019m not surprised LR is superior. C1 and Leica is a rather new pairing - they really dragged their heels on fixing the initial shadow issues with the M10r, almost eight months after release. The lack of support has been very apparent and I think only now they are putting in more effort. Where C1 really shines is with Phase one equipment, tethered, and doing mostly studio portraits. But I don\u2019t do that often enough anymore, and I find LR more of a goldilocks approach which I appreciate. Edited June 20 by Oswalt"

Chaz RAW files in general need noise reduction and sharpening. All programs have an initial setting and C1P does too, it is more gentile than Lightroom. Some people claim that the photos from Lightroom come out sharper and they prefer that. when you shoot JPG in camera the noise reduction is calculated in camera and applied. Capture one does apply NR different setting for different cameras, and shooting condition. This is probably the same for all other program. with the M10R been so clean in high iso, I like to -----> experiment !!!  with sharpening and NR off for an organic look in C1P. the only one I keep on is the Color Noise setting."

Am planning to get the Voigtlander close focus adapter to go with it. My idea is to use my Leica lenses ... I saw a video on YouTube that made it seem like manual focusing would be easy on Alpha cameras, with the touchscreen, focus magnification and peaking. The 40/1.2 looks good. Ideally I would get a zoom (24-200). One downside of buying a full-frame versus an APS-C seems to be that the pancake 16 and 20 lenses from Sony cannot be used on the A7C."

Z6 has minimum ISO of 100 and Z7 of 64. With IBiS capability ISO 64 becomes default. Higher ISO is also good and pretty much grain like if noise reduction is disabled.

      "content": "Thank you everyone for all of the great replies...I like this community and everyone's willingness to share ideas and help out. Quote They are just ... tools (expensive for some people), -A.Noctilux, I agree..a camera is just a tool and it is a very expensive one at that. I'm the kind of guy that would buy a finely crafted screwdriver for 10 times the price of a cheap Chinese one. Both will accomplish the same job (hopefully without breaking) but I enjoy quality, craftsmanship and pride in ownership. I love photography, I certainly favor certain brands over others but I don't feel that I would have a life long commitment to one brand...whatever tool works best for my needs. Quote I've had Leica-M cameras since 1988 and never had the rangefinder need adjustment, although it can be affected by shocks. I have the M10 and the 020 Visoflex, but don't really like using the latter. -Nowhereman, thanks for the reply...it sounds like with a certain degree of care it shouldn't need routine adjustments...this is great! Quote My own advice re: RF focusing: When in the split field and are twisting the focus STOP when you see that first contrast alignment. Don't fall into the habit of diddling back and forth to check. With practice you'll learn that there'll be no doubt about your skill and you'll nail 'em every time. When you can do this in gloomy flat light concistantly It's a great feeling. -Stephen.s1, Thank you for the advice...I look forward applying that technique Quote Two years with my first Leica camera, the M10 and so far the RF remains precise. I do use my gear often and as needed, only taking care not to use in any sort of rain and of course handling as careful as I would any other advanced camera system. With some practice ( weeks), I am now able to use the RF for both 1.4 and even f0.95 successfully and consistently. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I was able to shoot RF at F0.95 consistently too. * I do need to use my specs when using the rangefinder and if I get into a situation where RF is difficult, I'll substitute with Zone Focusing sometimes using both techniques, to get the shot. The 24MP M10 sensor is just fine, more than fine for me even along side my 61 MP Sony. I am sure I will at some point upgrade to the M10-R, but for now I don't see any need or urgency to update the M10 to 40.89 MPs. Just starting out, I might advise to spend on Leica M lenses and start out with the 24MP M10. FWIW, even after two years I am still thrilled and very happy with my Leica Rangefinder kit which to me is a completely different system and approach compared to my Sony mirrorless system. I would't give up either any time soon, and very happy I can use both systems. -LBJ2, Thank you for the tip on keeping the rangefinder window clean...I think the 24mpx M10-P will be perfect for my applications. I really like my Sony too and I just love the thought of having a drastically different system...I'm looking forward to it. I'm a perfectionist, I can't help it...I insist that my first lens be a Leica M lens...good glass never goes out of style. Quote I did the same for my 40th birthday: a brand new M10 plus a lens. One of my best present ever \ud83d\ude42 _Dennis, great minds think alike...thanks for the encouragement Quote To KNOCKS AND BUMPS: Unfortunately mine fell down twice from the hight of a seat of approx 40 to 45cm onto hard ground: The first time onto gravel and the second time onto a hard tile. Well there are very little marks on the body but the rest was fine and perfect. Maybe I was lucky but I am sure that the equipment is extremely solid. -M10forMe, I'm sorry for the misfortune but it does sound like you lucked out...I'm happy to hear of the great build quality and durability Quote The 10P and 10D look so nice with the lettering on top and no red dot, bit its a personal thing. I just swapped my 10P for a 10D. It was a hard decision but to me the 'absence' of the rear LCD is my perfect digital camera. The P is lovely too. 24MP is a sweet spot. I have a Visioflex 020 as its quite a useful addition to the D (es when using wide or long lenses (I have a 24 Summilux and a 90mm Elmarit) I dropped my M9 Monochrom once, from standing height. It landed on the lens hood of the 35mm Summilux mk1 and broke the hood. The vertical alignment got knocked out of whack. 'Normal' use won't do that. Quite get your idea of getting what you want and enjoying it from the start. _NewtoLeica, Both the 10P and 10D are great looking cameras with a vintage vibe that I love. I may -----> try !!!  the Visioflex in the future if it's something I feel that I need, hopefully I can learn to nail focusing without it. One reason I love to use lens hoods is to protect the lens from an accidental drop...I'm happy you didn't break your lens."

      "content": "10 hours ago, Travis Hill said: is it supposed to stay in or out? It should stay OUT (the roller almost sticking out of the camera front), under pressure from an internal camera spring. The spring is what forces the roller to maintain contact with the lens' moving focus cam. In theory, that spring itself can fail - but gummed-up lubricants in the mechanism are far, far more likely to cause a jam or sticking than a broken spring. ****Uh-oh!**** In examining my own M10 to confirm exactly how the lever works - I just noticed that the tip of the RF arm is catching or rubbing intermittently on the lens mount ring as the spring forces it forward. The screw and brass washer on the top of the roller-cam axle (above the arm itself) just barely clear the mount even when normal, but mine has/had even less clearance. --img--  Mostly it is just a brief contact that the spring overrides, but a couple of times it stuck hard for a moment (this would also cause the RF image to stop moving part-way through the normal range). I cleared this problem by applying a little downward pressure on the arm with a tiny screw-driver tip - but I don't recommend that as a procedure. There comes a point where uninformed or sloppy DIY work on the Leica RF just becomes a can of tangled worms that only Leica can untangle. I just happen to be a lucky risk-taker. Like the gospel song says, \"The fingerbone's connected to the - handbone; the handbone's connected to the - wristbone; the wristbone's connected to the - arm bone.....\" This is a word of warning for those of us who have -----> tried !!!  to adjust our own RF for infinity focus - be really careful not to apply ANY upward pressure on the roller and arm when inserting or turning the 2mm hex (Allen) wrench!! You can bend or introduce enough play in the arm's vertical location to cause such sticking. No doubt I made this mistake at some point. Edited January 4, 2020 by adan"

Now I am wholly cognisant that what one is buying is 99% profit margin for the maker and retailer but the damn stuff seems to work, when other liquids, like lab grade Ethyl alcohol, lab grade Isopropyl Alcohol, Eclipse and Visible Dust's own Sensor Clean just don't. Smear Away even removes the horrible blobs of sticky Wetzlar Goblin Snot, that Leica sensors seem to attract. The M8 and M9 sensors were far less fussy and the far cheaper Eclipse fluid or 100% lab grade Ethyl Alcohol worked just fine on them. My M10-R sensor seems to be staying somewhat cleaner, maybe down to lack of use with Covid lockdowns but it is time it had a clean. My bottle of Smear Away is way past its use by date and it is time that what little remains, is chucked. I would just be interested if others have successfully wet cleaned their M10-R sensor and if so what did they use? I have no idea if the surface coating of the M10-R sensor is the same as the M240 or not. Smear Away has also worked well on my SL and CL sensors, so it might be best to stick to what seems to be working, even if it is priced like the most exotic couturier perfume. Wilson"

I had a Gordy's shoulder strap on my M Monochrom, back in 2013. I liked it a lot. It seemed nice leather, and because it's a thin strap, it didn't take up much space in a camera bag. Sadly though, the strap failed, and my M Monochrom fell to the ground. Fortunately, it hit a wooden floor, and there didn't seem to be any damage to the camera (I went on to drop that poor camera on two further occasions). The point where the leather loops back on itself at the ends was the problem. The binding had come adrift, and I was surprised to see that it was a thin metal staple underneath which was securing the loop. The staple had not held. Other straps I've used since have stitching, which ensures that the two leather halves are secured tightly in multiple places. I emailed Gordy's and they were very apologetic, and sent me a new strap, free of charge. Can't fault their customer service. But my trust in the design had been dented, and I now use Tap & Dye straps, which I think are great."

As a West Australian, we know how to live with 45C heat, but this experience in the Gobi desert was a magnitude higher.

May I ask, please, about any differences you have discovered? 22 hours ago, pedaes said: Intersting. Why did you swap to Summilux (asks a Summilux FLE user). I also have 2.8 Biogon as sunny day small lens - sharpest of all the Zeisses (see Sean Reid for good in depth reviews of all the 35's and 50's). first of all, i did not swap to the summilux fle but i swap to summilux classic Pre-asph (Titanium) my reasons are as below: 1. Design and weight --> I like the design (lens's body) of leica more than Zeiss and the size of summilux is too smaller than the Zeiss 35 f1.4 2. Titanium version --> It's not the limited edition but the amount of that quite not too much (it's almost exclusive for me ) 3. It's Leica ---> I like leica more than Zeiss haha 4. The character --> There is leica glow like dream that make my picture look smooth but sharp enough. However, I have used summilux 35 asph (Pre-fle) as well. I like this lens as well. in future i wanna -----> try !!!  fle version because many users said that was good lens."

However, money is not unlimited, so I still have some choices to make, which I'm hoping some of you can help with, or at least confirm that they might not be as tough as they appear. My current thinking is that I can get a good used M10 (\u00a34100) and 35mm Summilux ASPH II (\u00a32300). I'm mostly going to be using this for travel and street style, so I think that this seems like a good combination. Photography isn't my profession, or even a money-making sideline, it's just for my own enjoyment. And yes, I fully realise that there are many cheaper, newer, 'better' cameras out there. I don't want one of those. But then, the internet hinders as much as it helps. Should I spend another \u00a31000 for the M10-P? The touch screen looks nice but isn't a big issue for me, and the quieter shutter is, well, nice? I don't see hundreds of threads of people complaining about the outrageously loud shutter on the M10, so is it really worth it for me? And it will take me another few months to save the extra cash. Then there's the M10-R, obviously, but at least another \u00a33000 on top of my M10 budget. And an even longer time to save. Ideally I could add in some actual real world experiences to my decision making. However here in the UK it doesn't seem possible to hire any of these cameras so I can't -----> try !!!  them out to see which I prefer, and I don't know anyone with one either. I find it very easy to get caught up in the details, just because there's something newer, 'better', whatever.

So maybe my question is this; is the M10 still a good value introduction to the Leica world? Thoughts, ideas, and help all appreciated. Yes I think so. Anyway, for me the gateway to Leica World in the nineties has been secondhand gear and it has been for a long time after. I then even preferred an M4 above a new M6. In your case however I personally would definitely choose for the M10-P. The silence of its shutter is such a joy in actual shooting, which would be my main reason. But in theatre photography, which I like, it is an important functionality too. The built-in level gauge would help me making good vertical shots and with a 35mm, or wider later on, this is an important aid. As I get older I see that I make much more often tilted shots. The touchscreen is faster in checking focus. Your argument for the choice for the Summilux 35mm asph ii is bull\u2019s eye in my view. It is exactly during travels that I have enjoyed it as a very versatile lens which covers a wide range of types of photography in day and night."

I have used the \"Thumbie\" thumb rest on the M8, M9P, and M240 so I wouldn't be without a thumb rest now. I tried the Leica grip on my first M8 but found it made the M8 feel large and cumbersome although it gave better grip of the camera owing to the M8's awfully slippery covering. Regardless it was gone after about 3 months of -----> trying !!!  it. Pete."

Between the 40MP M10R that I'm lusting over, and the A7SIII that I recently got making me ask myself if 12MP is enough, I've giving a lot of thoughts to MP lately. I even decided to look through old files recently and I digged through my dropbox to download some 8k photos I shot in India in 2011 with a Nikon D3S (12MP). Beast of camera. Beautiful images, so easy and enjoyable to edit, and I actually printed some on a1 and you wouldn't see a difference. Yes, its less flexible for cropping, but it has a softness and imperfection (compared to a high res sensor) that can be quite pleasing. So I decided after that to -----> try !!!  shooting photos with my A7SIII and the photos I got were very beautiful. On my 27 inch imac, the final jpeg output looks incredible. You cant tell they are 12MP. That being said, I think the best compromise/sweet spot might be 24MP. But I still want the M10R... Total GaS"

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) Hi Folks, I recently got a new M10-P and love it a lot! Upgrading from a M8.1, the difference is night-and-day (still love the M8 for the CCD color). However, after two weeks of very careful usage, it started to randomly freeze the shutter release or the LV. After reading all the related posts I can find in this forum, I upgraded to the latest firmware (3.21.3.50), which is supposed to fix the freeze. However, the problem persists and it is getting worse (I am encountering it everyday now, 50 - 100 exposures a day). I've already reached out to Leica and got a generic 'send it in and we will take a look' response. However, before I part with my new favorite camera for an extended period of time, I want to check again to see if folks are still experience either the shutter or the LV freeze with the latest firmware? If you have experienced this, how did you (or Leica) fix it? My worst nightmare would be shipping it in and they can not find a problem... Thanks for the help and support! ----------------------------- 1. Problem Description: Sometimes when I pressed the shutter, it produces no action. And when I look into the viewfinder, it indicates that the shutter is locked at the half-pressed state (a red dot appears in the AE mode and remains there even if the shutter is let go). After the camera enters this state, I either have to press the shutter again, or shut off the camera completely to get it to function again. Additionally, LV freezes at a lower frequency and need a battery-out-restart to fix. 2. Troubleshooting steps I\u2019ve -----> tried !!!  \u2022 I\u2019ve changed the lens and the problem persists. \u2022 I\u2019ve changed the shutter soft release buttons (multiple ones, with and without) and the problem persists. \u2022 Ive changed multiple SD cards (small and slower, large and faster) and the problem persists. \u2022 I\u2019ve tested different battery level, and no difference here. 3. Does M10 have a reliability issue? I\u2019ve never had unreliable Leica before, film or digital, especially with shutter! So you can image the frustration, especially for a model that prides on its silent shutter (which I like a lot!). It seems this problem is not an uncommon encounter, which prompted me to think if the M10 tends to has a reliability issue (understanding the self-selection bias in going through forum posts)."

Then stop the lens down & shoot at a much slower speed & see if the problem is still there because shutter problems like yours usually only happen at fast shutter speeds. If the problem does happen at a slower speed, remove the lens, set the shutter speed to \"B\", shoot the camera & see if you can inspect the shutter curtain to see if its fully open, but do the fast speed & then slow speed first. Sounds like you'll have to send in your camera to Leica, USA\" I'm not happy that a camera that is supposed to be so well made can't handle professional use, and the shutter is giving me problems already.

      "content": "I bought the following accessories for my M10: Leica thumb grip #24015 I -----> tried !!!  this on in the camera store and really liked the feel. The downside (as all the reviews will tell you), is that it covers the camera hotshoe. Leica M10 Hand Grip #24019 Combined with the thumb grip, the hand grip really makes your camera feel more secure. The downsides are - this grip screws into your tripod hole (it has a spare tripod hole to the side), so it decenters your tripod hole. Because it uses a thumb wheel, it is only slightly more finicky to get off than your standard bottom plate. The other downside is that it adds weight to your camera. Leica M10 Holster #24016 I am quite finicky when it comes to camera straps. What I want the most is a broad strap so that it puts less stress on my shoulders when I carry the camera. The holster holds the camera close to your body, and it won't swing around so much when you are moving (unlike a neck strap). It could be improved if they included an addition waist strap to really hold the camera tight. The fit to the camera is snug, rather than tight - I would say it is perfect. Not so tight that removing the camera is difficult, but not so loose that the camera will fall out either. Also, buying a holster means that you can avoid two purchases - you do not need a half case, and you do not need a neck strap. If there were accessories that attached to the holster (e.g. spare pockets for CF cards and batteries), you might even get away with not carrying a bag. Leica Wrist Strap #18783 This is the only accessory I do not recommend. I needed a wrist strap to hold my camera secure (since I am using a holster), but this one is too thin and not comfortable. I will be replacing it with something else."

The hand grip, with the finger loop, plus the thumb grip is the most effective solution but it seems to depersonalize too much the camera and the weight increases a bit too much. In the end I opted for half case and thumb grip (I did not notice a rise in heat) which seems to me the best compromise between weight and grip and there is an additional protection for the camera."

I'm genuinely curious. It's not just similar to the S3, the sensor is literally the S3 sensor cut down to 35mm size. Looking at some S3 samples might give you a better idea since the S lenses give a very consistent look. Lots of lens types being used on the M10-R here and elsewhere: Lux/Cron/Sum, CV, APO/non-APO, vintage lenses, etc., so it may be difficult to get a good idea of the R sensor characteristics just by browsing Flickr for M10-R images. Maybe -----> try !!!  and filter Flickr for M10+50Lux, then filter for M10-R+50Lux. The best way I could describe the M10-R is it matches the tonality I get with the Q2M. The M10-P I had did not feel as in sync with the Q2M. Probably all just in my head, but after all this kind of stuff is purely anecdotal anyway."

Following up on my M10-P Rangefinder drifting thread, where I asked whether the body was front focusing or not, I went to Leica in Thailand and even though the camera is still within it's warranty, they told me that they cannot solve focusing issues and the camera has to be sent to Singapore. As my camera was bought from HK, I will have to pay P&P of 250USD as well, and it will take around 2-3 months. I also would have to go find the receipt, as they cannot just look at the serial number for some reason. If I am unable to supply the receipt, then a maintenance fee will be charged as well. Yesterday I had some free time and was itching to get the problem sorted, so I researched this forum about DIY rangefinder adjustments and a few YouTube videos, went out and bought a 2mm Hex key for $1 and adjusted the roller for horizontal alignment myself, using the night stars as a guide for infinity. However, my vertical alignment is also off so there are always 2 stars in the focusing patch no matter what I do, making adjustment very difficult. At the end of all that, the rangefinder does not coincide at infinity, but focus from 0.7m - 5m seems to be accurate (still slightly front focusing but acceptable) for Summilux-M 50mm at F1.4. I have a few questions regarding the adjustments. Horizontal adjustment (please kindly see attached photo from the internet, of an M7?) When the hex key is inserted into the hole, and clockwise turns (red arrow) are very easy and the rangefinder arm does not move at all. However, when I -----> try !!!  to turn anti-clockwise (green arrow) the rangefinder arm pivots down into the body with the turn, so I had to do a lifting motion whilst also turning the hex key. This lifted the rangefinder arm further out of the body once, but it then moved back so I am not sure whether this will cause any problems in the long term. I made sure not to press the rangefinder arm in the direction of the top plate and it looks the same as far as I can tell. Hopefully I didn't bend it? Vertical adjustment Apparently this can also be done with the 2mm hex key. However, I have no idea how to unscrew the cover screw on the camera without scratching it. Some have suggested wrapping a screwdriver in electrical tape first, but I am hesitating to attempt it. Has anyone else managed to removed the screw, and how did you do it?

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) Hello there, I am a Fuji (X-Pro3)/Ricoh (GR III) user which shoots (not professionally) street for 90% of the times (10% being some long exposures and landscape photography). I have an M6 which I love and I am now thinking about getting a NEW digital Leica M so that I can use the same M-mount lenses and consolidate a little. Currently I have a Voigtlander 35 mm/1:1,4 Nokton VM II but I will look at other lenses in the future (28/50 Leica or not this is still to be confirmed). But the idea of having just one film camera and one digital camera with the same mount, the same ergonomics and the same characteristics (if you will), is very very attractive. Potentially I could keep the GR3 for everyday kind of snapping tool, and have the two Leicas for a more sort of introspective and slowed down photography. Now, besides the technicalities, I am wondering why should I go for the M10-P or the M10-R, considering the small price difference. A few things I have been pondering on: - I do not need a 40MB sensor. - I may need long exsposures capabilities of the M10-R (by looking at my pictures' exif I see only in one occasion I had to use iso 1000 at 240 seconds, one at iso 100 at 240 seconds, and one 1600 iso at 30 seconds. last one being astro which is a completely different beast and I would not even -----> try !!!  to accomplish good results with a tool like the M series. Having said that, if the camera has decent capabilities, why not?) - I am wondering how much the M10-R battery life is impacted (for a street shooting in particular), compared to the M10-P. - I like the discreet touch of not having the Leica red button (I can probably just hide it somehow, but I do not want to risk damaging it in case I need to sell the camera at some point). - Would compatible lenses such as Voigtlander and Zeiss perform ok with such a big sensor the M10-R sports? Thoughts? Thanks in advance"

I would def. recommend the M10-P instead of the M10-R for a few reasons: - 24MP allows to shoot slower shutter speeds (ie 1/60 with a 50mm or 1/30 with a 35mm), whereas with 40MP I felt I had to keep the shutter speed at 1/250 to get sharp pictures. That\u2019s fine if it\u2019s the Monochrom, given it has an insane ISO performance, but with the M10R you don\u2019t get the same kind of ISO performance and are losing 2/3 stops of light due to this factor. - 40MP gives you huge files, which are great if you want to print or crop a lot, but there are also cons such as slower transferring times to the laptop, larger files to save on your limited storage, and more power required to edit them - M10P design is cleaner too without the Leica red dot in the middle, and you can get it in silver or black. On top of that, M10P is cheaper. - 40MP and 24MP should both be future proof, even the M9 with 18MP is fine today 11 years later. And for those who shoot film, anything above 10MP is already more than enough eheh Hope this helps with your decision. Whichever you get in the end, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it and never go back : )"

I also have a large format/historic lens set for pleasure which is so far removed from today's digital wonders in terms of its operation, that, apart from the fact that it produces images, it seems to have very little in common with either the Sony or Leica M systems.

Note that SOME older wide-angles are very difficult to correct for. The Leica 21mm Super-Angulon f/3.4-f/4 lenses from the 1960s always produce strong purple corners, as does the Voigtlander 15mm from 1997 and the Zeiss 15mm Hologon from the 1960s.

Since not all cable releases are equal it could be that the length of the cable release's 'prong' that extends into the M10P's shutter release button is a little short and is sitting on the M10P's tolerance so shaking the cable release could cause the prong to lose contact with the shutter action when the shutter would close. The other thing that springs to mind is that the thread pitch inside the M10P's shutter release button could easily different to the thread on your cable release and your cable release is not getting screwed in far enough and what I wrote in the previous paragraph comes into play. I know from using soft release buttons with my M10 that the shutter release's internal thread is slightly unusual and I think it's tapered so that might be preventing your cable release from connecting properly.

The M works the same way as any rangefinder camera, the central patch in the viewfinder is your focusing tool. It is important to look through the viewfinder in the optical axis. Looking into the camera skewed will result in inaccurate focus. The first thing to do is to ascertain that you can see the rangefinder patch properly.

The one that allows you to see the rangefinder patch and framelines sharply is the correct one. Order the nearest value from Leica. In a pinch you can use over-the-counter reading glasses for this test. If your eyes need special corrections, you can use your spectacles, provided you can see clearly at 2 meters distance ( the virtual distance of the rangefinder patch). Note that the background will be at background distance,so your eye should ideally be able to accommodate over the distance differential. However, there is some tolerance here. For special cases there are viewfinder magnifiers. They can help, especially with longer and fast lenses and they can give confidence, but they can also be not very useful; they cannot correct errors in the focusing mechanism or your eye, in fact they magnify them. Also, one loses contrast and brightness. Leica offers a 1.25x one and a 1.4x. These need diopter correction like the camera, but often of a different value than the camera viewfinder. There are also third-party magnifiers, sold by Japan Exposures, that include a variable diopter correction. 1.15x and 1.35x. For patent reasons they cannot be sold in the USA and Germany for use on a Leica camera, but they can be purchased for use on for instance a rifle scope. Basically, for an experienced user, magnifiers are not needed and will only lower contrast and brightness, but some users do like and use them. Once the viewfinder is corrected optimally, there are three methods of focusing, in ascending order of difficulty aka training. 1. The broken line method. Look for a vertical line in the image and bring it together in the rangefinder patch to be continuous. 2. The coincidence method. Look for a pattern in the image and bring it together to coincide. This may lead to errors with repeating patterns. 3. The contrast method. Once you have focus by method 1. or 2. a small adjustment will cause the rangefinder patch to \"jump\" into optimum contrast. At that point you have the most precise focusing adjustment. Side remarks: If you -----> try !!!  focusing on a subject emitting polarized light like a reflection it may happen that the polarizing effect of the prism system in the rangefinder will blot out the contrast in the rangefinder patch, making focusing difficult. In that case rotate the camera 90 degrees to focus."

Look for a vertical line in the image and bring it together in the rangefinder patch to be continuous. 2. The coincidence method. Look for a pattern in the image and bring it together to coincide. This may lead to errors with repeating patterns. 3. The contrast method. Once you have focus by method 1. or 2. a small adjustment will cause the rangefinder patch to \"jump\" into optimum contrast. At that point you have the most precise focusing adjustment. Side remarks: If you -----> try !!!  focusing on a subject emitting polarized light like a reflection it may happen that the polarizing effect of the prism system in the rangefinder will blot out the contrast in the rangefinder patch, making focusing difficult. In that case rotate the camera 90 degrees to focus."

You could argue that contrast could be an issue with the rather dark screwmount rangefinder, but I think bothering about contrast misses the point for an M. If there is a problem with the rangefinder, it is not contrast, but precision. Either precision of the camera's mechanism (if it is not corresponding properly to the focus of the lens) or more often precision of your sight. The \"contrast\" lenses make the viewfinder darker, which does not add to precision but stands in it's way. Magnification can help, but only if the brightness of the viewfinder is not reduced."

I -----> tried !!!  one or two in the past on various M cameras but IMO they are snake oil for the sophisticated M rangefinder. They appear to increase contrast, but in reality they reduce overall viewfinder brightness, which is counterproductive in low light.. The best way to increase the ease of focusing is using the correct diopter. 4 hours ago, UliWer said: Magnification can help, but only if the brightness of the viewfinder is not reduced. Which magnification always does, by definition. On top of that it will, in some cases, magnify the problem as well. I have bought, used and discarded a number of different magnifiers, but they always ended up in the back of a drawer after a few weeks. The only conceivable use is with a 135 lens, which is slightly beyond the focusing optimum for an M rangefinder, especially to magnify the rather small frame. Nevertheless an experienced user will have no trouble focusing without one, rather the opposite. They are not meant to aid an incorrect ocular strength or failing focusing technique."

H Scottee320, Jaap is right. the M10's ISO values are inflated as compared to the Nikon's. As you stated you are setting all exposure parameters manually so metering patterns and exposure compensation dials have no effect here. I first discovered this when i tried to set my exposure based on a handheld meter reading. Now wether YOUR M10 is defective or not, probably the best way to find out is to perform the same test with the same lens using another M10.

First ask yourself what type of photographer you are That will go a long way to answering the questions of focal length and lens speed. Then, if you are going for an universal set of lenses for the future, consider the type of photographer you are. Do you like to keep a bit of distance, then you might opt for a set of 21 (24)-35-50-90. Or, if you like to move in,, 18(21)-28-50(75) might be more useful. As for lens speed, if you are someone who likes a bit of depth of sharpness, a slower lens will save you some money and often be sharper. If you like narrow-DOF, at least one of your lenses should be a Summilux, preferably at the longer end. Once you are clear on these issues, you can decide which lens will be your most used and you can get that one first. Both 28 and 35 are good choices to start with, as is a 50 mm lens, but a 35 mm lens feels a bit more \"natural\" in its perspective, using a 28 takes more skill for general photography to get the perspective right and may lead to more cropping. OTOH, its wide angle allows you to \"tell a story within a story\" easier than a 35 or 50. For me, personally, 50 mm is my most comfortable focal length. However you are the only one who can answer this, recommendations from total strangers who are not you, will never be of any value. BTW, even if I would advise to get a Leica lens as a first, consider buying second hand and using the remaining funds for a Voigtl\u00e4nder or Zeiss companion lens. For instance, a used Summicron 50 (plentiful and not too expensive) or Summarit 50, combined with a Zeiss ZM Biogon 28 will make a powerful set."

However I still don't get the mindset that persuades people to remove the factory markings, but each to his/her own. Strangely when I purchased my new M-A I did originally go for the plain black chrome but eventually ended up which the silver chrome with prominent lettering."

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) 4 hours ago, jaapv said: Exposure is not a fixed value to be left to the (rather limited) brain of your camera's automation, and the M has a rather low IQ compared to the sophisticated systems of more modern EVF cameras. No matter, it passes more of the responsibility to the photographer. Remember that there is no correct exposure, it depends on the photographer to determine the final result. Don't expect the camera to do the thinking for you. Using the OVF you can use the histogram by chimping a test shot, using the EVF you can do so in real time (obviously). If you use the histogram to refine your metering, just keeping it at 3/4 from the right edge is the wrong way to go about it; you are throwing away your dynamic range on many shots. The same goes for dialing in a permanent negative exposure compensation, BTW. There are two things to look for: 1. the \"mountain(s)\" in the middle should be as high as possible. 2. if there is a spike at the right up against the edge, you need to interpret it: a. if there are blown specular highlights in your image that should be present, e.g. the sun, or strong reflections on water, disregard the spike. b. if you want detail in all highlights, back off the exposure to the left until the spike shrinks away. With the spot meter of the EVF/Live View you can pinpoint the exact exposure of all parts of a scene by moving the camera around. Even with the center-weighed metering of the M OVF it is worth \"scanning\" to determine the exposure value of different parts, to decide which exposure comes closest to your intention. Example: When photographing a sunset, never take your exposure off the sun or off the foreground: always expose for an area of sky next to the sun and then compose your image. Thank you, this is very helpful info. Where I was having trouble at sunset yesterday was in the near-specular highlights, such as the sun-facing side of a light-colored blade of grass. The grass in the photo I posted was exposed correctly, but I had quite a few that looked ok in live view but were just a bit too hot. I will -----> try !!!  out your suggestions and practice! 6 hours ago, mujk said: It's good to remember that the M10 has two separate metering systems. The one in use when only the OVF is in use (shutter closed during metering) has exactly one mode, more or less equal to center-weighted metering. When liveview/Viso is in use (shutter open), there are three different modes to choose from. This may be a bit confusing in the beginning. Wow, thank you. I totally missed that in my pre-M research and my skimming of the FAQ questions here, but that makes perfect sense. Sounds like it\u2019s time for me to go completely through the manual in fine detail."

I think the text in the updated instructions was developed at that time (but there may have been updates). We could only make the corrections happen at that point in ACR/photoshop. but not in LightRoom. So please indicate what works as described in the various versions of LR that are currently in use -- Classic, CC, etc. I think it will be helpful. By the end of the beta session, we were all still learning how to use the results. But we liked the new feature. Also, I think seeing the scene with the PC frame floating in front of you (on the VF020 especially) changes the feeling of shooting with a wide angle lens.

Knowing that it should work has prompted me to spend more time -----> experimenting !!!  and I have discovered that 1 of My saved Profiles has a 2/sec Self-Timer setting selected and it's that setting feature that is preventing the camera from loading that User Profile when it was the last one I used. Thanks to all who replied, it helped me track down the reason it wasn't functioning for me. It seems to me that this is a programming glitch. The M-10 DOES allow a Self-Timer setting to be \"Stored\" and then \"Loaded\" manually in a User Profile, but the camera will Not turn back on in that User Profile if it was the last one used when the camera was shut down. Just an FYI for anyone else that might encounter this."

It physically feels different but it\u2019s very digital and I dunno, it doesn\u2019t give me the fuzzies. Im thinking of selling it and getting an M10. A few days after buying new glass for it... this was spurred on by me realising that when I look at photos made with the SL I\u2019m disappointed by the technical quality. When I shoot with my Q or when I used the M9, it was never about the technical quality. I don\u2019t want to chase the pixel perfection fantasy. If I do that I\u2019ll aim for medium format but that\u2019s unlikely. I 100% would miss autofocus for family photos. But otherwise I don\u2019t need it. My ongoing projects - as I\u2019d like to make sure I don\u2019t shoot myself in the foot - are documenting people in their homes (wide angle plus flash), documenting the streets within 5 miles of my home (35mm lens natural light), I\u2019ll be doing some work at industrial plants and various places where people do \u201creal work\u201d as I call it. That just means the opposite of what I do. Off camera flash, wide angle 21mm or similar. Im really torn. I just made a waist level finder for the SL, I\u2019d miss that too. Any help or thoughts welcome. Along with questions that may help. I\u2019m not rich, this is a big buy for me. I can do it and still eat, I just don\u2019t want to keep shifting around."

As there is no link between the lens and the body live view is recommended to control focussing ; Nikkors being larger than the Ms they reduce RF vision... more than a bit. IMHO up to 135 mm the results are not bad, and the combo M/ Nikkor is rather balanced hand held. Beyond 135mm I think the tripod is mandatory to prevent shake.

On that score too I've recently discovered the Summarit lenses, 35mm and 50mm, they are definitely worth consideration."

A good comment However a few mods: 1. If you want a 1.4 lens you want a 1.4 lens. For me, the joy of 1.4 and lower, even at wide resolutions, is part of the joy of Leica 2. If you want the resolution get the R. Just note that for street photography you need 1-2 stops higher speed generally for crisp focus 3. Although I am a big second hand aficionado. I do recommend occasionally buying something new from Leica. Its a company we support and want to see profitable. One way to think of the premium over used, for the occasional item you buy new, is the membership fee for shooing Leica - if that works for you Best of luck.

      "content": "4 hours ago, dancook said: So I've been a bit obsessed with the M10M, particularly because of it's ISO handling. Either to zone focus street with high shutter and high ISO, to shoot narrow aperture low light live music or just to shoot at night with little noise.. I'll photograph street, live music, people, travel. Since I love the Q series cameras I'm gravitating to the 28mm 1.4 But last time I had an M10 I had the 35mm 1.4, which looking at my photos I quite enjoyed... --img-- Leica M10 + 35mm 1.4 by Daniel Cook, on Flickr I also assumed I would get a 50mm 1.4 The image also serves as a reminder, that I do love the colours that come out of the Leica (even if it was processed a little) - and so I'd want a colour body as well, else I'll feel like I'm wasting the potential of the lenses. So now my shopping list looks like this.. M10M M10R 28 1.4 50 1.4 ASPH Since I'd buy used, it'll all come within budget of about \u00a320k - although a used M10R is like hens teeth. Ok I realise I can change my mind down the road, perhaps add a smaller 28mm for street. Writing things down helps me organise thoughts, but also if anyone has 2 cents - like I wonder how many would opt the M10P and change the lens line up. M10-M and M10-R IMO is the quintessential Leica M camera kit. If you can manage both, at least for a time...just do it ! Personally, I will always prefer more light with my lenses, even over the potentially more technically perfect F2 M lenses. I can always do more with more light and I love to shoot wide open as often as I can, hence my own lenses: the Lux 35 FLE, 50 ASPH and 24 1,4. Of course I had to have the Noctlilux 50 F0,95 too even if it resulted in doubling up on 50mm in my kit--too very different 50s so I don't mind owning both. To date, I am happy/content with the 24MP M10 with my current Leica M lenses but I would have prefered some of the extras in the M10-P, and I do want to -----> try !!!  my Noctilux on the M10-R some day in the not too distant future. For now I am happy/content to use the Noctilux adapted on my 61MP Sony when I am craving all that resolution at F0,95. Personally I love the 35 FLE for street. No wide-angle edge of frame exaggeration and you can stay an important distance away from the subject without having to cram in too much distraction into the frame. The M + 35 FLE at F8 zone focus even all the way up to 1600 ISO to me means the camera and lens are almost invisible and I can just concentrate on the composition and timing with a speed of reaction that is sometime required to remain discreet and when I need the light, easy enough to switch between RF and ZF. Good luck on your adventure!"

Leica and Sony Full Frame. I very much like having two different technologies to use as needed/wanted. I am now very familiar with both systems and using one as a back up to the other is not a problem for me at all. One of the new SL2/SL2-S cameras is certainly a consideration given my M lenses will perform best on a Leica sensor than a non Leica sensor, but I find my M lenses perform very well adapted to my Sony FF cameras. The Sony A7rIV's 5.76 million-dot viewfinder is superb for punching in for fine detail while using Sony manual focus aids. One small and affordable adapter and the Sony A7rIV + M lenses is a beautiful kit with IBIS too if that is something important to you. I use as wide as 24mm Summilux on my Sony's with very good IQ success. *One down side to adapting M lenses to non Leica camera bodies is the loss of EXIF data which can be a PITA. ** If Sony FF is an option/consideration for you, you can probably get a very good used deal on the 61 MP A7rIV right now as many are selling this fairly new camera to upgrade to the latest greatest Sony A1.

I agree with that. A Leica CL is a really cool companion to the M10... And I love shooting with the CL and M lenses for completely different reasons than I love the M10. - Is the camera just a secondary thing and hangs around your shoulder? CL is lighter and less expensive so I feel less protective about it (with Elmarit 28). So it's not just a backup, it can have it's purpose depending on the intent before leaving home. - Focal lengths/ compositioning (lack of better words) change with the 1,5x crop and it stays fun and interesting. - Feeling of the CL in your hand is sooo much better than other brands (my opinion), I feel right at home with the menu and I like the first page, this information screen like the SL much more than the M10 version. - Focussing with M lenses I think works really well since I have punch-in on the right dial and it became second nature to compose, rotate the dial (needs the official LEICA adapter, no third party one!), watch for the peaking, recompose, shoot. I just really like it... would recommend it. Edited February 17 by Marckyokay"

Or is this a faulty camera? Help please. Thank-you. *(There seems to be a slight red cast to the few jpgs I have but I turned jpg off very early on, and I probably need to check them again in daylight conditions as I only have a few indoor shots in weird mixed lighting conditions.)"

You can -----> try !!! , the more nudges M10-D owners can give Leica the merrier........I've been asking Leica to initiate few things regarding the M10-D firmware ever since I bought it nearly two years ago but all requests have gone mostly without any response at all. I did receive two replies regarding my asking if it could be made possible to select whether to have the GPS on or off, they emailed saying that it was \"a really good idea\" and that it would be passed to their software team.........but absolutely nothing has happened. The GPS usage on the camera is pathetic at best and because it can't be turned off it drains the battery much quicker when the 020 EVF is mounted. There have been no meaningful firmware updates for the M10-D at all since it was launched and as much as I do truly like the camera and I'm happy to own one I dub it Leica's \"Orphan M\" because of the lack of any development or improvement at all of it's firmware. A dream for me would be that Leica releases in the next \"D\" iteration a MD-Monochrone. Now that would be perfect, I'd even forgive the useless GPS functionality and other design oddities, ( I never use the 020 now anyway ), but because I suspect the sales didn't justify more investment maybe the M10-D is the last of the \"D's\", I hope not."

      "content": "I own a 35lux FLE and a 35 1.4 ZM Distagon and recently traveled for a week with the zeiss as my only lens. I didn't find the weight an issue, but left the hood at home to keep the lens as compact as possible. I quite like the rendering of the zeiss and it is a fantastic performer wide open. On the optical front I like many others have no complaints. I like the extra speed it gives me over f2 lenses/crons because I shoot with an M240. If I had an M10/P I'd still use it because of the flexibility f1.4 gives in terms of playing with Dof. I had purchased the zeiss on a whim just to -----> try !!!  out and see what the hype was about, with no intention of keeping it long term.. but now I would feel hard pressed to sell it. The biggest gripe a lot of people have with it is with it's size - when comparing the 35lux FLE and zeiss side by side and hoodless, there is a rather significant difference. I can only imagine the difference being greater when comparing it to the summicrons, especially the pre-asph variants. I tend to leave the hood on my 35lux FLE because my copy can have a tendency to flare, while the zeiss on the other hand is more flare resistant and had no issues shooting hoodless. There is less of a difference in length when the 35lux hood is left on while the zeiss is hoodless. I do like how the zeiss' hood is rather compact and doesn't add too much to the size of the lens, but I think one can do without it unless they use the hood for protection (I use a filter). I didn't feel the added weight of the zeiss on my trip, though I did feel it initially when I compared both 35mm lenses.It took a while longer to get used to the extra length of the zeiss.

      "content": "I'll take a shot, having used both. The Zeiss optically is as good as it gets in any 35mm f1.4 lens. Compared to the Summilux it has a smoother bokeh, a flat (not wavy) plane of focus and better flare control. Wide-open it is sharper than the Summilux, particularly away from the image centre. I switched completely from Canon to Leica because of this lens, which comfortably out performed the Sigma 35mm Art that I was using previously. But I eventually sold the Zeiss for a Summilux. The finder blockage was occasionally a problem, and I need to carry two sets of filters (all my other lenses used a 46mm thread).The Zeiss is also slower to focus with a much stiffer focus ring, which can be an issue if -----> trying !!!  to focus rapidly (for example, in quick street photography). My advice would be to opt for the Zeiss if working more slowly and where every last drop of image quality matters (eg, landscape, travel), or opt for the Leica if your priority is small size and quick focussing (eg street, documentary). FWIW, I also think that the Zeiss is also better built than the Leica (loose aperture rings) and of course much much better value."

I'm not very smart about this. I bought all the tools and supplies ages ago, but never had the courage to practice on my good camera. Then I stupidly gave away some of my old DSLR cameras - I should have used one for learning how to clean sensors. My Leica M8.2 needs a cleaning, as does my M10. My Nikons tend to stay clean for a very long time, probably because the mirror is blocking the dust from getting onto the sensor.

      "content": "9 hours ago, M10 for me said: Let me just reopen this thread. Today I had my Canon A-1 (with a 50mm lens) from the late 70ies in my hands and I realize how well all buttons and wheels are built. The focusing ring goes smooth whereas the aperture ring is quite stiff and there is no way that you can change the settings accidentally. Even the exposure compensation wheel is secured by a little button on top. Only the focus ring can be turned unintentionally which is no problem as I have to use it anyway for each shot (when not using zone focussing). With my M10 its different: The exposure rings of the lenses change their position very often unintentionally. So does the exposure compensation when the back wheel is activated for that function. As a consequence I set the back wheel to off (normally I take photographs with the OVF only). But when I want to make an exposure change (I rarely do that though) then this still works (without using the menu) by pressing this famous front-button (called focus-button) and at the same time turning the back wheel. Try it out. It is possible but very uncomfortable as its hardly not possible with one hand (you have to press that button AND turn the wheel simultaneously !!). So I understand some dissatisfaction. For users working frequently with LV or use an OVF that button is probably helpful. Wait a minute! One of the very few gripes I have about my M is that at times the Exp Comp dial gets twiddled. It does this because of a defect in my operational manner; I never turn the camera off, I always let it go to sleep and rewake it by tapping the shuttle release. As such this presents the opportunity to accidentally change exp comp when I drop the camera back to my side. This takes care of that! Thanks for posting as I didn\u2019t realize (should RTFM sometime) that you could do that. Back to -----> trying !!!  to have my cake and eating it too."

Well, you will not learn too much when reading the manual. For a reason or another I think that manual is not done to the utmost conscientiousness not to say sloppy (no comparison to the 600 page manual of the Canon 5D Mk IV)."

      "content": "5 hours ago, Papab said: Currently using a Sony rx1 which is a fixed full frame camera with 35mm lens. I have been considering Leica for years but having just retired I thought I would dip my toe into the world on Leica. I am excited to have purchsed a Leica M10-P and need a 35mm lens, I am on a tight budget at the moment so looking for a non Leica lens. Maybe a voigtlander or Zeiss? I guess 7 artisans is a no no? Many thanks in advance and I am looking fwd to being part of the Leica forum. Welcome \ud83d\ude42 Under $1k, I would suggest the Zeiss Biogon first (as wisely others suggested), then the Voigtlander 35/2 Ultron or the TT artisan 35/1.4 I have ZM and TT; I never -----> tried !!!  the Ultron, but I read and heard it is fantastic. Without a doubt, I think the Biogon has a better IQ of this group, but it's 2.8. If you need a faster lens, it doesn't work. For some is enough; for others, it's not. I don't like his weird focus knob (or focus tab or nothing would be better), and the aperture stops by 1/3 ... Besides that, wow. It's an incredible lens. The TT is more notable, heavier (400gr), but it performs well. It has a nice kind of mixed characters: modern lens (not clinical) but with a lovely smooth rendering. Weakness: lens flare; sometimes it's very welcome appreciated, sometimes could be substantial."

      "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) Hi all, my almost 2 years old M10 gets some problems. The biggest problem is: the Leica repairing service is worst. First repair :Around March this year, the LiveView sometimes didn't work. What I got was a grey screen, seemed the shutter could not fully open. Leica replaced a flex board or something and the problem was solved. Second repair: After repairing, new problems appeared. The camera sometimes shut down after taking a few photos. Half press the shutter it woke up again. But the shooting opportunity was gone as it took few seconds for it to wake up. Moreover, the LV button would stuck when the camera and the shooting environment was hot (over 30 degree celsius), while the MENU and PLAY button still able to work perfectly. Even in normal temperature, the touch feeling of the LV button was rough and not the same as the other two. So I sent the camera for repair again around Aug. I received an email stating the repair was finished, which stated the \"button is adjusted\" but cannot find the shut down problem. They advice me not take photos too rapid and need to wait the buffer to clean up. I was surprised by the advice as I never heard a camera would shut down because the buffer is full. So I send an email to them to make sure both problems were corrected. The customer officer confirmed they were fixed. Third repair (not yet): After I received the camera, both problems is not cured. The LV button jammed on the second day and the camera shut down even I take only 1 pic, not rapid shooting. And my almost new screen protector was scratched with long lines after the repair. I wrote email to complaint and what I got was \"pls send the camera to check again\". OK, this is my last Leica and I would advice all the people rethink before -----> trying !!!  to buy any product from this brand. Don't get me wrong, I understand even a Rolls-Royce could fail, but every car manufacturer could replace the whole engine if they fail. I don't believe Leica could not even repair a single button, and they re-confirmed it was fixed before sending back to me. I have Nikon, Canon and Sony, they are not problem free but after repairing, they all work perfectly for long time. Now I need the third repair even though no one could ensure the technicians understand how to repair a camera or not. Do you think there is Germany customer department to compliant or something I could do? Thanks for your advice and once again: Leica repairing service is worst in my personal experience. No more Leica in my life. Edited October 2, 2020 by vwillrocku"

Yes, the camera was sent to Wetzlar and as you described, it is extremely frustrating and annoying as M10 is the most unstable digital camera I own. I owned my first DC since 1998 and even the cheapest one was much more stable than M10. I have a friend who own an M10 and he also have bad experience such as needed to remove battery to fix a freeze. I have to say again I don't expect M10 is perfect, but I expect it can be repaired and I also expect the customer service can be better. I even asked them to bear the cost of shipping for this time but they refused. What makes me really upset is the screen protector was scratched after repairing. If I am the technician who made the scratch, I must replace for a new one for the customer rather than pretends nothing happened. This is the basic norm of a responsible after service department, right? But the Leica customer service didn't even reply \"I am sorry that your protector is scratched because......\" after I made the complaint. They perfer to remain silence. If the Leica service could not even do right in such minor aspect, how can I trust the whole repairing service and customer department? I have already send quite a lot of long emails to reflect the problems but what I can get is \"resend the camera for inspection\". They don't promise anything or -----> try !!!  to do something. It is a good advice to find a manager, do anyone here have a email contact? I am not living in Germany, Europe or US, so direct calling may be not possible. Edited October 2, 2020 by vwillrocku"

It\u2019s been my favorite digital camera \u2014 in fact, really my only digital camera, as every other digital SLR or rangefinder I\u2019d -----> tried !!!  over the last 20 years felt \u2018wrong\u2019 in my hands. The M10-D was the first one that feels exactly right. I mostly use a Zeiss Sonnar 50/2 and a Summaron 28/5.6, which covers my desired perspectives well, and are reasonably compact and sturdy. I did some minor configuration when I got the camera, but since then have not changed any of the settings. I tend to use auto-ISO and auto-shutter (aperture priority), which, again, works well for the subjects I\u2019m shooting. I rarely use wifi mode and the Fotos app. Mostly I just pretend the camera is a film camera, and pop out the SD card like it\u2019s a roll of film, and use an SD reader on my iPad or Mac to import the images. (I carry a spare SD card, along with a spare battery.) I bought the EVF finder, but rarely use it. It\u2019s useful for longer lenses, but unfortunately it sucks power badly, and I just don\u2019t shoot in a way that requires it."

Have you -----> tried !!!  the digital M's with screens and didn't like them either ? I borrowed an M10 (non-D) from my local Leica dealer for a few days. It was good, of course, but I think what really enjoy about the screen-less D is... well, the lack of the screen! I\u2019ve always enjoyed understanding the art & skill & craft of photography, and I\u2019ve always found that a screen (e.g., an automatic preview) de-emphasizes the understanding. Of course, some people think different: they are concerned only with the final result, and if the presence of the screen makes that easier, than that\u2019s the better solution. But for me, I\u2019m happy with the process being slower, more thoughtful, more dependent on my own decisions of aperture/etc. \u2014 even if I don\u2019t get to see the results for a few hours."

      "content": "9 hours ago, chasdfg said: There are quite a number of threads on this camera, though not as plentiful as the other M10x variants. I actually started 2 of them (one about a year before I got the camera and another more recently) and have also aired my views about this camera in various threads, so pasting the links to those threads and posts here instead of re-hashing. The first link has a number of views by M10D users so you might find that useful. The second link was more of a rant by myself but has praises of the M10D too. I should state I have long forgotten the issues I raised in my half-rant of a thread. The latter two links are less M10-D-centric. I wanted the M10D since it came out in October 2018, was almost tempted in January 2019 but decided to get a used 50APO to go with my M240 instead, rather than use the 50APO money to trade up the M240 to the M10D. In January 2020, I was on the hunt to replace my M240 and was thinking between the M10P or M10D (I wouldn't have owned both). I missed on a good deal on an MD-262 around that time too, and would probably have been happy with that camera instead of the M10D if i managed to snag that, as it used the same accessories as my M240. I then picked up an M10M on a trade and sold the M240 and there was a lot of camera activity on my end from then till the end of 2020.

A rangefinder and a mirrorless are very different kind of systems. I think they complement each other much more, than compete with each other. It is not either or for me. Not black and white only. I think they have very much different uses cases, and enjoy them in very different type of photography. I also have the GX8, and some smaller and lighter Lumix m43 cameras like the GM1 and GM5. I love to use them when I would like to travel really light (much lighter than my digital M camera), but still have something more flexible (possibility to change lenses, and add a small flash) than my mobile phone or my compact camera. Great cameras and with some some good, and some great lenses. My favorite is also the Leica 15/1.7 - outstanding for being AF and so small. Love that lens! Edited September 15, 2020 by martinot"

Heres a photo of my current underwater set-up. Lightweight (I used to use Canon FF cameras and the Sony is SO much easier to carry) and effective, for me, the Sony A7II can be a great underwater unit and a very capable one, once that is I have finished fighting the appalling menus. Set to manual and with a minimum of other control adjustments pre-determined, it works well and delivers. But I rarely use the cameras outside studio type shots because I have Leica M9s which in most situations deliver better imagery because I work better with them. But the A7IIs can deliver technically. Sadly, Leica don't really make anything as viable for underwater use as the Sony. --img-- "

Hi Stuart, I do see what you're saying but really, if we compare this M-10P model to the other limited editions, it's actually quite a reasonable price, and more interesting to the eye than a standard model. A name is just a name really. This is just an homage, and a very nice one at that. The high price is what we all pay for the brand and the overall quality."

I'm forcing myself to use it as much as possible, unless there is a reason why I have to use a DSLR. 1970s Leica advertisement: --img--  Anyway - the frameline lever is just one part of a very complex frame-setting mechanism with multiple overrides powered by springs or finger pressure. The lever will (temporarily) override the mounted lens - but springs will also override the lever when it is released, to hand back control of framing to the lens flange. This also occurs in the foil-thin metal viewfinder masks themselves, which are moved one direction by the lens or the lever, but will spring back to the \"35/135\" setting if no lens is mounted and the front lever is not pushed (as well as force the frames to \"follow\" the focus mechanisn for parallax correction at different distances) At any rate, the springs actually in the viewfinder are very small and delicate hairsprings. It does not take much dust or grease or stress-bending in storage to lock them up and lead to \"half-and-half\" framelines. With the M6 and later cameras, Leica added a \"centering spring\" with detents, that is supposed to force the frames to \"snap\" to one position or another rather than stick halfway in between - but it too can get gummed up. Leitz and Zeiss/Contax had -----> tried !!!  for years to come up with a multi-frameline viewfinder that also incorporated the rangefinder (i.e. zooming wouldn't work). It is apocryphally reported that when Leitz finally solved the problem with the M3 (\"Me\u00dfsucher: 3 frames), and revealed it at the photokina show of 1954, the CEO of Zeiss came over, shook the hand of Ernst Leitz III, and told him, \"You win!\" Zeiss phased out its Contax RFs soon afterward. I don't think any RF makers, except Mamiya with the 6/7, has ever managed to successfully copy the auto-indexing of framelines that Leitz/Leica achieved. Nikon, Canon and the \"new\" Voigtlander all settled for manual frameline setting with dials, or permanent silvered brightlines."

I did, trust me. Even if I go closer and fill the whole frame with the lamp it does the same thing. If I move to my dining table and put the viewfinder to cover the table where the light shines, the exact thing happens. I've noticed this in the wild too. It's still usable, but I'm wondering if this is normal. My MP is a lot more stable."

The X system doesn't inspire, and the GFX system is too much of a big lump, so in the end I grab neither when leaving the house.

I know its limitations, and for me they are made worse now by the fact that in the intervening 2 years my eyesight has worsened, and I'd need to wear glasses while focusing the OVF. But I always found the M system pleasurable to use, and would often find myself picking up, and taking out the M without a clear objective in mind... just get going. My last M was the M10. I thought it was brilliant. There wasn't really anything much I would have wanted more (except perhaps IBIS, but we are told the wizards cannot do that spell yet, or perhaps ever). And, having \"looked away\" for a couple of years, I'm only now catching up on what has come since - the M10-D, M10-P, M10-M, M10-R, etc. It made me smile to see that the M engineers are still working on improvements, without losing what the M is all about. So, I'm pondering what to get, starting in the M system again completely from scratch. There's are lens choices to make.

Many are better skilled at focusing at f/0.95 with a rangefinder patch than me, even with lens/body alignment assured. So for lenses, I have a shortlist in mind. Where I find myself still trying to work things out is the current crop of bodies. I've seen some of the tests, and debate on M10-P v M10-R v M10M. Clearly no one is buying the Monochrom unless they want at least a good chunk of their efforts to go to B&W output. But I'm also more persuaded by those who say the technological advantages the M10M might have aren't for them the main reason they bought it - rather its because carrying the M10M forces you to \"see\" black and white images, to pre-visualise, because you can't hedge your bets later in PP. When I had the MM and M246 I found my B&W work improving because I was focused on light and shape. I also enjoyed being able to attach colour filters to lenses and play around with that. Some argue that having the colour channels info in your RAW file at PP gives more options in processing than a Monochrom file - you have these channels to slide around, absent in the Monochrom files. Some say the M10(-P) files have more latitude in them, other say the M10R files do. Some point to the challenge of rangefinder photography at higher resolution - human errors are amplified (shake, mis-focus). I didn't pose a question in the title of this post because I'm not quite sure what mine are yet. I guess at this point I'm interested in comments from experienced M users who have considered an M body purchase in the past year or two. What were your considerations, what did you choose, and has the experience of the new body delivered what you thought it would? Also, if you bought an M10R or M10M, did the higher resolution lead you to like certain lenses more, or less, than on lower resolution bodies? And, FWIW, I'll update here too what I end up getting.

I'd forgotten (forgive me!) how much I enjoyed chatting with other photography nuts here on this forum. \ud83d\ude42 chasdfg - so much of your experience seems familiar to me! Regarding the M10D, I really smiled when I saw that one. I can't claim to have been part of the clamour here from those who imagined this camera, but I was one of those persuaded by it.

My aging eyes now benefit from a +.5 diopter, in addition to my glasses, which correct for distance and astigmatism. Maybe heresy on the M forum, but some folks have switched to, or added, a Q2 or Q2 Monochrom to deal with poor eyesight and to have a compact solution by cropping the 28 lens to 35 or 50 equivalent (via VF frame lines), made possible with the higher resolution sensor. Not my cup of tea, but others like. Jeff"

Today, there\u2019s no hope at all of focussing anything other than my Rolleiflex TLR without wearing them (and even on that big viewscreen you rely on the focus \u2018pop\u2019 to find it). Wearing my glasses means not seeing the whole viewfinder, the outer framelines are difficult to work with. My Minolta SLR is limited because I can\u2019t see the exposure meter information and f # in the viewfinder very well. I\u2019ve gotten used to the limitation with my M but it robs me of the full joy and rather than limit myself to a compromised view I have resolved to address this properly. I would like to -----> try !!!  wearing contact lenses for my photography, but active cases in my region, of this awful pandemic are keeping me away from the optician so these plans are delayed for now. The other option is a dioptre corrective lens fitted to the camera, something I\u2019m now looking into (ha ha!). I have a CL digital with built in dioptre and this works perfectly as a solution but I\u2019m far from happy with an EVF. Edited January 8 by Mr.Prime"

I have found in the past that I feel very natural composing in 35mm, so that, and I think 50mm would make a good two lens starting point. I'm still debating 50APO and 50LX. Before I think it would have been no hesitating for the 50APO. I owned that lens for 6 years and know its immense capabilities. But right now for this system I also feel a little tempted back to the more painterly qualities of the near-focus range open aperture range of the 50LX ASPH - which, as we know, is no slouch either. But, I'm still working on this... You have the benefit of many years experience with old and new Leica and what appears to me, a very open mind...I like and value that on a Leica forum. I only know the M10 OVF and I've always been near-sighted. The M10 and my glasses seem very natural to me which is great since I can't RF accurately without it and my eye lash smudge the Leica diopter so I can't RF with a diopter either. Not sure if the M10's slightly increased eye relief has anything to do with it or it's simply all I know ha ha. My lens path started with the 35 Lux FLE and 50 Lux APSH specifically for the f1,4 and later selected the large Noctilux 50 f0,95 for special occasions. My motto has always been buy as much light as I can, even if the 50 APO is stunning at F2 and latest-greatest APO technology is my typical inclination. One day I'll -----> try !!!  the 50APO, but don't want to give up f1,4. Even with digital, I find f1,4 logistics very much needed for low light where I have to really push ISO to keep handhold-ability. Either way, best wishes and much fun on your Leica M rebuild journey and I look forward to reading about your finds and adventure. Edited January 8 by LBJ2"

      "content": "That's very nice of you LBJ2, thank you. Taking the (not insignificant) issue of cost aside, it strikes me that we consider three things when choosing a lens at a given focal length: the light-gathering potential of the lens (1.4 gathers twice as much as 2.0 after all), the ergonomics (bigger v smaller lenses), and 'drawing' capabilities of the lens. I feel that the whole catalog of present day lenses is way better than good enough optically not to restrict the photographer, at least this one, and many of the older lenses too. Do you mind a front-weighted camera via a heavy lens? Do you want something compact? Do you want a focusing tab? How much of the frame can you tolerate being blocked by the lens in the OVF? Do you want high contrast or lower contrast? Do you want a very neutral drawing, or one with lens signature contributing? Do you really want a flat focus plane with edge to edge sharpness, or could you find a curved one useful for human subjects? It's why I feel the MTFs are just a useful component, and not the deciding factor. Take the 2/50APO and 1.4/50SX ASPH for instance. I really love both of them and I am finding it hard to decide between them. For me, the way they render is a bigger consideration in this decision than the f-stop difference between them. The M10's sensor, in my experience, already had enough head room for most of the low light situations I find myself in, and the dramatic rolloff between the on focus plane at f/2 and out of focus on the 2/50APO is so clear that I never found myself wishing for one more stop of 'thinness' in that regard. Rather, when shooting a human subject with the 2/50APO I sometimes wished I'd had the (relatively speaking) more gentle feel of the 50SX's rendering, especially when lighting conditions already delivered plenty of contrast in the scene. Between the 2/35SN ASPH II and 1.4/35SX FLE, it's partly about the ergonomics. The latter can have a slightly stiff focus tab when the FLE is moving, while I found with the former I got into a snap-fast rhythm when focusing, and loved the overall form factor of the package with the M. But I think here I may return to the FLE, because the look here at f/1.4 offers more possibilities for me than f/2 on the Cron. (I -----> tried !!!  each generation of the 35SN, and my favourite was a v1 8 element copy, but I also know that when dealing with lenses of that era, each copy delivers something slightly different. My dealer had 4 copies of that 8 element lens at the same time, and I shot two scenes with each of them. I then asked him to pull the files up on his computer in LR and show me each image without telling me which copy of the lens produced it. I selected my copy based on the images rather than the cosmetic condition of the body or glass. It did turn out to be the most expensive copy, with a great barrel and glass condition, but it's not always the case in my experience. All that to say that sometimes the older lenses offer something the newer ones no longer do, and its nice to have one when the situation or mood calls for it). Again, I just want to get back out shooting, and I must remind myself that any choice I make here is not going to be the technical limitation of what I can produce. If the ergonomics, and the special feeling and method the M motivates me to shoot, then it will be the practice, practice, practice, that will give me the results I'm looking for. That said, I really do appreciate the advice on this forum, and the anecdotes of others' experience given the choices on the table today which are wider than the choices I last had a couple of years ago. I'll better accept the choices I do make if I know I gave it all good consideration (and the eyesight issue is a new factor for me)."

      "content": "@Winedemonium I didn't realise you've had the M60 & MD262 before, like the Monochroms. Just want to add points on the M10D and M10M compared to their predecessor(s). On the M10D, aside from the slimmer body, it has that really nifty thumb rest. I wasn't sold by this at first. Ergonomically, even without the thumb rest the M10D feels better in hand than the M10M because the back of the camera has no clutter and no LCD in the way. When I -----> tried !!!  the M10D at different Leica stores I didn't much of the thumb rest and thought I would only use it for the sake of it. I was very wrong though, and it's something that grew on me quickly. Another thing is wifi, which is quite handy when commuting and I want see some pics I've taken or to use the remote function with live view via the Fotos app (not that I use wifi much, but it's there)...though the wifi aspect can be very divisive for purists. Also, the M10D looks so bloody good and is the most beautiful production digital M I've seen. This said, my feel about the M10D is that unless one is absolutely averse to the idea of processing film, buying a film camera and shooting film would get you there too, so it's not really as much of a game-changer in that respect. Plus it really depends on one's view of the \"inconvenience\" of developing film - if one enjoys the process, then it's not much of a con (I for one am too lazy and would probably hoard dozens of rolls before doing anything about them). My only bugbear about buying a Leica film camera now is that prices for popular cameras have gone through the roof (and too the moon, and past that) in the past couple of years. On the M10M, I completely understand the appeal of the M9M and how unique those files are. I tend to view the M10M a little differently, in that the camera is it's own camera, not just lumped into the family of \"Monochroms\" and having the title of being the latest one on the market. It isn't an M9M and won't be. It has different film loaded into its DNA and will produce different files (out of the camera, the files are too punchy for my liking, so much so i changed the LCD picture review to have lower contrast too). Alfonso Cuaron mentioned that when he was producing the movie Roma, he wanted that movie to be in black and white, but didn't want it to be a black and white movie with the film grain and rawness reflecting the 1970s it was set in. He took a different approach and wanted the black and white aspect to convey nostalgia yet shoot \"clean\" black and white, utilising the strength of modern sensors today (with Arri cameras) and exploiting the depth and capabilities of this modern medium. I hope I didn't butcher or mis-convey what he was saying. Anyhow, I realised that that is how the M10M sensor should be seen - a modern medium to shoot black and white. Not Tri-X, or Ilford Delta, or even M9M. You can emulate those in post to some degree, but the M10M can also be its own camera and should be seen as it's own camera. It's tough even within the trio of Monochroms due to the M9M's cult following. Just my thoughts! Of course the above is moot if you just want to go simple and just get an M10P or M10R. Either one of them can do everything the M10M and M10D can as long as you have the self-imposed limitations, plus the M10R can do high res too. Lens wise, I feel the same as you about the 50APO in that I never found the f2 lacking in giving me \"thin DOF\". I would always say the 50lux ASPH is the ideal 50mm M to get because it does everything great (not just doing everything \"good enough\" but great) with speed, sharpness, size, MFD all thrown into one. I don't think any general photographer should find the sharpness and capability lacking in all modern Karbe lenses and they are all reliable performers image quality wise. More so if you don't go out testing lenses to no end and worrying about wavy plane of focus or that pinch more distortion than the 50APO, which to me are imperceptible and almost never in-your-face. One thing I've determined after my tedious and tiresome journey to deciding my current kit is that honestly, the only rational thing one should do is ensure you can afford what you're looking at. After that, the heart takes over and you should just get what you want. Too much of my time was wasted counting pennies and depreciation over 5 years, not wanting to put so much money in a spare camera, feeling guilty about owning X camera or Y lens, being practical or \"too economical\"...and this took a lot of joy out of the hobby. Ultimately, if you do get your lenses used, the cost of ownership per month is almost nothing if they are kept in good condition (plenty of places in HK to shop used too. I am envious!) and the cost of ownership for each of those cameras per month probably the same as how much you'd spend on film (or a nice meal or some alcohol...you get me).

The M cameras work the same way as any rangefinder camera, the central patch in the viewfinder is your focusing tool. It is important to look through the viewfinder in the optical axis. Looking into the camera skewed will result in inaccurate focus. The first thing to do is to ascertain that you can see the rangefinder patch properly. A correct match between the rangefinder and your eye is even more important than it is using an SLR. Leica sells corrective diopter lenses.

The one that allows you to see the rangefinder patch and framelines sharply is the correct one. Order the nearest value from Leica. In a pinch you can use over-the-counter reading glasses for this test. If your eyes need special corrections, you can use your spectacles, provided you can see clearly at 2 metres distance ( the virtual distance of the rangefinder patch). Note that the background will be at background distance,so your eye should ideally be able to accommodate over the distance differential. However, there is some tolerance here. For special cases there are viewfinder magnifiers. They can help, especially with longer and fast lenses and they can give confidence, but they can also be not very useful; they cannot correct errors in the focusing mechanism or your eye, in fact they magnify them. Also, one loses contrast and brightness. Leica offers a 1.25x one and a 1.4x. These need diopter correction like the camera, but often of a different value than the camera viewfinder. There are also third-party magnifiers, sold by Japan Exposures, that include a variable diopter correction. 1.15x and 1.35x. For patent reasons they cannot be sold in the USA and Germany for use on a Leica camera, but they can be purchased for use on for instance a rifle scope. Basically, for an experienced user, magnifiers are not needed and will only lower contrast and brightness, but many users do like and use them. Once the viewfinder is corrected optimally, there are three methods of focusing, in ascending order of difficulty aka training. 1. The broken line method. Look for a vertical line in the image and bring it together in the rangefinder patch to be continuous. 2. The coincidence method. Look for a pattern in the image and bring it together to coincide. This may lead to errors with repeating patterns. 3. The contrast method. Once you have focus by method 1. or 2. a small adjustment will cause the rangefinder patch to \"jump\" into optimum contrast. At that point you have the most precise focussing adjustment. Side remarks: If you -----> try !!!  focusing on a subject emitting polarized light like a reflection it may happen that the polarizing effect of the prism system in the rangefinder will blot out the contrast in the rangefinder patch, making focusing difficult. In that case rotate the camera 90 degrees to focus."

      "content": "I have used a lot of cameras over the years. I now use Nikon's for work with my Leica. Somewhere in this forum others have talked about the idea that there is a perfect fit for some people when it comes to your favorite camera. For street photography the M-9 was the best thing that ever happened to me. Followed by a 240MP, for a short time. In March of this year I decided the SL2 was what I needed--can't remember exactly why now. It is a nice camera, but until I actually walked the streets (Washington, DC) I didn't realize why I am a Leica M person. The slightly heavier SL2 was too heavy. The electronics were diversions to me. The bulk wasn't subtle, especially with an SL lens (I -----> tried !!!  to get back to normal with my Summilux--helped a little). A lot of things on the camera I don't use or need. So, at a loss, I sold the barely used SL2 to B&H for about half price in September. Maybe 500 images. Not many, but enough to conclude that this wasn't my camera. I then bought the Leica M-10R and it is absolutely heaven for what I do with a camera. So after all these years I have come to the same conclusion as some others - it isn't a question of the best camera. Not even the best camera for a particular type of use or work. It is the best camera for you. Your photography personality. And when you fall in love, you know it. I won't actually need another camera the rest of my life. I doubt there will be a new M that improves on the 10R, for me anyway. And the Nikon's still work fine on more mundane work projects. Jim"

I\u2019ve attached a link for reference. Notice the majority of influence over the skin tones is determined by the purple slider. In my experience on professional Canon systems (as well as Fuji), skin tones are generally captured in the Oranges, Reds, and Yellows. On occasion, I\u2019ve noticed them \u201cbleeding\u201d into the Purples/Magentas, but generally it\u2019s an easy correction with a hue adjustment toward red in Lightroom. This has happened more on my Fuji gear than my Canon, which I thought was just a product of the XTRANS. Images for reference. Note: I\u2019ve increased each slider to 100 to illustrate the influence of the respective slider, not as an artistic decision. https://imgur.com/gallery/mFTvTGz I\u2019ve had to do more \u201cadditive\u201d color editing (color grading with added oranges/yellows in the mid tones) to get even close to the effect I desire to be consistent with my professional body of work, but it\u2019s tedious and feels more like a workaround as opposed to simply a different process. Is this a hallmark of these sensors? Has anyone else had an issue with skin tones merging into the purples? The issue here is that it doesn\u2019t give me precise and consistent control over tonalities which are consistent with my other work. Not only that, but as opposed to adjusting a couple of sliders to produce the look, I\u2019m adjusting literally three times more to -----> try !!!  and get close and, eventually compromise, on the desired look. Also, here is an attached photo with the exposure info as well as histogram illustrating that I\u2019m shooting at base ISO, and exposed with the limitations of the M10 sensor in mind. https://imgur.com/gallery/v2EPnGf I want to add that I\u2019ve been shooting for over a decade. This certainly isn\u2019t my first rodeo. The only thing left for me to -----> try !!!  is making my own custom color profile, but in over a decade of shooting, this has never been a requisite to get the colors I want out of my photos. Does the M10-R improve on any of these shortcomings? Also, I want to preempt against any comments telling me I\u2019m just confused or apologetics from Leica koolaid mixers. I\u2019ve read some responses on this forum before from some of them and they seem to be obstinately opposed to the notion that perhaps the sensors in these cameras aren\u2019t as good. While DXOMark gives the M10 a higher overall score than my 6D, in my experience, the colors are more pliable. Finally, my artistic discretion is going to differ from yours. I have seen a lot of photos posted here in discussion which are also effectively SOOC, with minimal correction. I have a stylized look I go for, which requires flexible colors.

In my experience on professional Canon systems (as well as Fuji), skin tones are generally captured in the Oranges, Reds, and Yellows. On occasion, I\u2019ve noticed them \u201cbleeding\u201d into the Purples/Magentas, but generally it\u2019s an easy correction with a hue adjustment toward red in Lightroom. This has happened more on my Fuji gear than my Canon, which I thought was just a product of the XTRANS. Images for reference. Note: I\u2019ve increased each slider to 100 to illustrate the influence of the respective slider, not as an artistic decision. https://imgur.com/gallery/mFTvTGz I\u2019ve had to do more \u201cadditive\u201d color editing (color grading with added oranges/yellows in the mid tones) to get even close to the effect I desire to be consistent with my professional body of work, but it\u2019s tedious and feels more like a workaround as opposed to simply a different process. Is this a hallmark of these sensors? Has anyone else had an issue with skin tones merging into the purples? The issue here is that it doesn\u2019t give me precise and consistent control over tonalities which are consistent with my other work. Not only that, but as opposed to adjusting a couple of sliders to produce the look, I\u2019m adjusting literally three times more to -----> try !!!  and get close and, eventually compromise, on the desired look. Also, here is an attached photo with the exposure info as well as histogram illustrating that I\u2019m shooting at base ISO, and exposed with the limitations of the M10 sensor in mind. https://imgur.com/gallery/v2EPnGf I want to add that I\u2019ve been shooting for over a decade. This certainly isn\u2019t my first rodeo. The only thing left for me to -----> try !!!  is making my own custom color profile, but in over a decade of shooting, this has never been a requisite to get the colors I want out of my photos. Does the M10-R improve on any of these shortcomings? Also, I want to preempt against any comments telling me I\u2019m just confused or apologetics from Leica koolaid mixers. I\u2019ve read some responses on this forum before from some of them and they seem to be obstinately opposed to the notion that perhaps the sensors in these cameras aren\u2019t as good. While DXOMark gives the M10 a higher overall score than my 6D, in my experience, the colors are more pliable. Finally, my artistic discretion is going to differ from yours. I have seen a lot of photos posted here in discussion which are also effectively SOOC, with minimal correction. I have a stylized look I go for, which requires flexible colors.

I photograph a lot in the tropics and my M240 was unusable without one - a strong orange-yellow shift that was very hard to correct without filter. The technical parameters that dictate a thin IR filter (thus less effective) are still present on the M10. It will be better than the M8, but far from perfect. Disregard the warning, and get a B+W 486 filter. They are better than the Marumi filter that Leica rebrands. I live in strong/bright sunshine year round and use my M10 mostly in natural light. What should I be seeing to indicate the need for a IR/UV cut filter for the M10. I've read using such a filter will not hurt...but to date I don't think I see any indication it is needed.

How much are you processing your images? I think for many, my SOOC shot, maybe warmed up a tad with a bit of contrast, would have been fine for a lot of shooters. But my work is a bit more stylized and requires a bit more \"oomph\" in post. To me, these issues, when they exhibit themselves, are mostly apparent when pushing my colors. Mind you, I'm not pushing them anywhere past a +/-40 correction in saturation in HSL, but that was enough to allow the banding to demonstrate itself."

      "content": "1 hour ago, LBJ2 said: BTW, are we discussing M10 DNG, jpeg or both? You raise a good point. I've always been a digital photographer and like many, I shoot RAW/DNG and like most process the digital files, some more than others of course. I've never seen anything like your examples which are nothing less than horrific and understandably alarming. But I do know pushing digital files to an extreme can and do cause bad things to happen to the file, I've just not yet seen anything as bad as the scenario you posted. I'll tinker around with some of my M10 images to see if I can replicate. I am interested to know if you are able to mitigate your scenario pushed hard in post with an UV/IR cut filter. DNG, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I was so dismayed by the tonal range that I was getting from the file that I myself had to double check if the previous owner of the camera had left it on JPEG and that I was editing a DNG. That I was editing a JPEG was my initial assumption, too. However, I was in fact working with a DNG so I knew something else had to be the issue. I also appreciate you not jumping to conclusions that my example here is the result of some elementary faux pa as others on separate forums have. I'd only turn to the community after exhausting every other non-Leica specific remedy I've attempted after 13 years of shooting. While I know the sensor in the M10 has limitations re: dynamic range, I've never seen such egregious handling of color in a DNG as demonstrated in the linked files. I'm beginning to suspect that it might be confluence of a few factors: 1) Outdated firmware + Factory reset (have yet to attempt as the camera I received was actually sent back due to a dishonest description of the condition by the seller). Though ostensibly, this can produce a magenta cast in the images. 2) Needed custom profile for the camera. My Canon stuff I use for professional work has more of a green hue SOOC, especially in the shadows. Perhaps a custom profile can push the color in that direction. 3) Greater sensitivity to IR. I have absolutely noticed this in the fabrics of darker jackets I've shot, wherein lowering the magenta/purple has reduced the exhibition of effect. I suspect that perhaps this effect is less conspicuous when looking at brighter tones, but is still there upon post-processing. 4) To a lesser degree, using older glass. While I maintain that I've never seen such an issue shooting on my other systems when using vintage glass, and have adapted this lens to an EOS M without any issue, I'm open to the notion that perhaps the M10 is susceptible to IR contamination even moreso on older lenses. Once I get another M10 in my hands, I will -----> try !!!  to find time to do some A/B testing to see what effect, if any, an IR filter may have on the image."

I have talked about this with a lot of people in many threads and through PM, and I came to the simple conclusion that it's just too many megapixels for a non stabilised camera system like the M. To skip you a lot of details, I believe that the R is good camera for landscape shooters, or people that shoot very slowly, ideally with no moving subjects. Unfortunately for me, I shoot people and things that move, and most of the times these people don't stop to pose. So the R is completely unmanageable, to the point that it hasn't left the house in a month. In the meantime, I purchased on day one an SL2-S, and it is the best Leica Camera (for me) that I have ever -----> tried !!! . I use it exclusively with M lenses (stills & video) and its an enormously enjoyable experience. M lenses, good low light, and IBIS, coupled with EVF focusing means that (if it is not a stolen shot where I cant look at the camera) I focus faster than Sony's eye detect., and nail 90% of my shots. The camera is so good that I thought of selling my M10R and saying goodbye for ever to the M system. But reading this thread, I went back to my memories, and just had a crazy idea: \"downgrade\" to the M10P. To purchase the M10R, I traded in my M10P and added 2,8k. I called the shop today and they said they would take my R back with a 20% devaluation (which is a good offer for the Leica store, since they are just taking it back for the price I paid minus the VAT). They still have my M10P, and I hope I'll be able to exchange it and be done with it. Because if they force me to buy a new item, I will have to trade my M10R and add 1K extra to get a new M10P. But the worst is that I am considering it! Why, because I remember how much I used to love the M system when I had the P. I used to shoot nice photos. And because I also know that none of the very few nice photos I got with the R needed more than 24MP. I got hit by GAS, and I learned the lesson. I want my P back."

It's perplexing because for the most part Leica design and menus are rather well thought out.

How hard is it to just bring over the same functions? And yes, that EVF issue. One could chew through 2 or 3 batteries in a day with the EVF and GPS on all the time (i'm being generous...it could well be 2 or 3 in an afternoon alone). Why not configure the function button + dial to turn the EVF on/off and also another option to turn the GPS on/off? It would have been downright amazing if we could have a quick menu set up in Fotos (same old favourites sort of menu in all other Leica cameras except a much shortened list), which can be accessed without Fotos after set up by pressing the function button and together with the LV magnification and dials (or some other combination) and which let us scroll through different settings (e.g. EVF on/off, GPS on/off, peaking on/off...off the top of my head all rather EVF-centric options but still useful). My wish is that the camera works well, albeit in a clunkier way, without the Fotos App and like any other digital M with Fotos, albeit via a phone. Ok, even if we skip the EVF-centric changes and kept the function button primarily to indicate storage capacity remaining and battery life remaining in general shooting. That's fine. But give me full M10 menus in the app! It is almost there. Maybe there are too few M10-D users to warrant the time and expense to cater to us and make those final tweaks. I popped down to my local Leica service centre today and they showed me how to open the shutter for cleaning (and made a comment about how I didn't read the manuals, when I was going on and on about how there's no \"sensor cleaning\" option in Fotos, which would be far clearer for general users). They kept the shutter open by switching it to WIFI mode, pressing the shutter (and the function button?), which then opened the shutter. They then told me if I wanted I could also remove the battery, and then proceeded to do so..and the shutter remained open. I haven't -----> tried !!!  this method myself as I left the camera with them for a general clean due to some dust on the sensor I couldn't get off with a blower using bulb mode (I couldn't keep the shutter open properly to do anything else, and didn't read the manual yesterday) and some lint behind the rangefinder patch which is distracting. I haven't explored the manual enough yet. In truth I never did bother with the manual on my other Leica cameras as everything is usually quite intuitive.

Will ask them for another demo when I pick the camera back up to note the steps, though I'm not sure how ideal it is to remove the battery when the cameras is turned on... chasdfg thanks for an excellent posting on this subject. As well as many of your points made here I agree about the fact that the on/off switch should have been around the shutter release as per the other M's, if only for muscle memory sake. I disliked the rear on/off/wifi switch from the get-go. I am sure that it wouldn't have been impossible to have the switch in the \"normal\" position and I don't think that the faux winding handle, ( of which I am a big fan! ), would have negated that being done because it's that way with my M7 anyway, so it's been done before........BUT thanks to another forum member's suggestion last year I bypassed that annoyance by simply keeping the camera switched on most of the time I take it out, the extra battery drain is surprisingly minimal. I've even left the camera turned on for days without using it and only lost about 10% of battery capacity. I don't use my Visoflex, and I don't use or need GPS because mainly I can remember where I was when I look at a photo' so for me there's little point in that, but I understand how it might be useful for others....despite the fact that on the few occasions I have tested it out it took ages to lock onto satellites, then needing another long wait for reconnection if the camera went to sleep between shots. Quicker to ask a passing stranger where you are and make a note of it. I don't know if Leica does actually monitor posts on these forums, I assume though that they do, but I wish that they were more responsive to feedback, responsive and inclined to act on any of our complaints and/or suggestions or at least give reasons why they went certain directions in design and implementation....perhaps that's asking too much?"

      "content": "Good to read that the M10-D excites you more than the M10M. I was toying with the idea to get a monochrome, but I am in doubt. Last month I did buy the EVF for occasional tripod shooting, or taking very low shots. I like it, esp the tilting functionality. But I will definitely not use it on a daily basis and still prefer the rangefinder. The GPS connection btw is a joke and fails 9 out of 10 times. I also purchased a used 24mm (Elmar), which is still doable with the optical rangefinder. So if you every want to -----> try !!!  to go wider than 28, don't let that stop you."
