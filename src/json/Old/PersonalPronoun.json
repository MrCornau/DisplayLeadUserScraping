The one concern that has come up from reviews so far is that the -----> improved !!!  headroom for exposures may not hold up at high ISOs. That comes from a rather sloppy set of shots taken in bad light, but is worth checking out while Leica is still nervously watching over the firmware health of their new baby. The Phoblogger complains that a bright light yellow turned white with slight overexposure at ISO 6400 or 12500, which seem to be usable settings with this new camera. What do you see? Thanks! I haven't gotten a chance yet to rigorously test how high ISO settings affect highlight recovery, but I can confirm that highlight recovery is in general noticeably -----> improved !!!  over the m10-p. I had my settings accidentally off for a shot and overexposed by ~2 stops, and when I looked at the LCD preview, I figured the highlights were irretrievably blown (based on my experience looking at similarly overexposed shots on the m10-p). However, when I got into lightroom, I was able to recover essentially all of the detail in the highlights, which was pleasantly surprising.

Since this is a hypothetical question, my answer would be a \"yes\" - hypothetically, of course. I would not buy the hypothetical Japan made camera instead of an M11 but as an adjunct to the M11. All the above is contingent upon my suddenly experiencing an unexpected financial windfall so that I would have the hard currency to buy both hypothetical cameras. As it turns out, attempting to buy any M camera or lens with hypothetical money yields the same end result as attempting to buy with the much ballyhooed \"exposure dollars\" that companies who want photographers to work for free always dangle in front of us.

For me the second option is well covered with so many other mirrorless cameras on the market for some years now. Besides if your mystery camera is Leica FF @ $3500...hell did in fact freeze over and we have other problems to deal with \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude43 Seriously, IMO the SL2/S are such great options with all the mirrorless bells and whistles for adapting M lenses and on the shelves available for purchase as I type its really hard to dream of anything else. The Leica Rangefinder is however a completely different love affair for me. Not really looking for another lovely at the moment.

I think perhaps that's the main problem. I only had issues connecting the camera to the app when I first got the camera, when I had the impression that connectivity would take a handful of seconds. Once the camera and phone are paired, its quite fast to connect and stable. I basically got used to just flicking the camera to Wifi, letting it boot up for about 10 seconds (while carrying on doing other things and not just staring a the green light blinking) and then going into the FOTOS app to pair the camera to phone. I have used the app for remote shooting. I also did a mini shoot for one of my friends before. The camera was paired for about 30mins so I could review pics on the go and it worked great the whole time. I've since sold my M10D to someone on the forum and do miss it sometimes. Prices are rising too. It's the perfect colour camera for me, of all the colour cameras out there right now. Sure, i have my list of things it could -----> improve !!!  on, but that -----> improve !!! d version does not exist (and may never). If i chose 1 colour camera today, that would be it. There was also a point of time I set the M10D to shoot in RAW + B&W JPEG. All the pictures displayed in the app were B&W JPEG. I was too lazy to edit pictures during that phase and simply downloaded the pictures from the app into my phone and used them from there..so I essentially had an M10-D Monochrom. That thumb rest...it's really some thumb rest. That and the slimness of the body without the screen are what I miss the most. Your hand falls nicely into place with the thumb rest and without the LCD in the way. Side thing, for some reason this thread reminded me of some M10D i stumbled upon on Schouten a few months back. The owner had replaced all the dials and knobs that were replaceable with silver ones (silver frame selector, ISO and shutter speed dials and screw). Looked pretty groovy.

I don't see any diminution in print sales just because they are 10- or 18- or 24-Mpixel images. If they touch people. Now, I suppose there are different markets (work-for-hire), where a picture only sells once, to one customer (bride, architect, fast-food chain, interior decorator), and the extra detail of 40 or 60Mp may be a selling point, because the pictures will wallpaper an office, or 10000 modestly-priced motel rooms, or some such. My wedding work was all back in the pre-digital era, but no bride I worked with insisted on \"medium format\" or \"4x5\" quality (what passed for extra Mpixels back then). If they hired me, they wanted the casual, journalistic 35mm \"coverage\" of their wedding moments - and knew that's what I'd deliver. ............... Anyway, I'll trade in my M10s for Mxxs if and when I see a compelling reason. It won't be megapixels, because I know my market.

Genuine question what are the \u201cissues\u201d with higher megapixels ? I would assume that it\u2019s more unforgiving of technical (focussing) errors ? Also - How about lenses ... does a higher Mp count reveal imperfections in vintage glass that previous resolutions didn\u2019t? I ask this because a recent seller of a 50:1.4 pre-ASPH mentioned that the reason for sale was he was using m10R and as a result had switched to the latest and greatest lenses (namely APO in his case ). I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s valid logic but would appreciate opinions. my only experience of high megapixels is Sony A7Riv 63MP.

I'm really happy with my A7Riv although naturally it's had very little / no use since I wandered into a Leica store and picked up an M But it is really impressive. In practical terms I doubt that I need higher than 24MP in an M at this point ... even the noticeably quicker download to my computer and pain free editing makes the experience match the M system really well IMO (simplicity/compactness/lightness). This may change in the future but right now very happy.

Each to their own, I guess. I guess I'm one of those who deny this I still have my D800e and 100% crops from that are as sharp as from most anything that I've used. Even though the AA filter was removed from the 800e, there is still a low pass filter (albeit weaker than the AA filter in the original D800) so that does blur things a bit in comparison with the D850 for example, but that's not the result of having \"more pixels\"....the 850 actually has \"more\". I tend to do physical prints, so in theory higher resolution would benefit me by allowing more crop flexibility while maintaining a good print resolution. Practically, 24MP is plenty for that though. But also practically, even with my older computer systems, 40-50mp doesn't bog anything down for me, and there seems no downside to having higher resolution sensors. The irony is that for applications where the additional resolution would theoretically benefit (BIF or wildlife from afar), I'm typically handheld with a long telephoto doing my best to keep up with the subject. In those cases, regardless of IS or technique, the extra resolution doesn't often buy you what you'd like. On the other hand, for landscapes or other scenes that are composed, one can often define the framing and perspective as desired and even though the capability exists to cut way into the image, it's not needed and you end up throwing resolution away by the time you adjust for print. There are definitely some nature applications though where it is beneficial to crop into the scene because you can't physically get to where you want to.

I am just saying it at this point because some of the corrections can amplify the CA effect in Lightroom , your original JPG probably has some, but not so extreme.

When you focus on a point straight in front of you & take a photo: The image plane in focus is a plane that is a straight line that is like the horizontal top of the letter \"T\". Also: Think of the line that is the part from the top of the \"T\" to the bottom as being the line from you to the subject. When you focus on something which is a distance horizontally away (Left or Right.) from this line to the top of the \"T\" then you are actually focusing on the circumference of a circle with a radius that is the length from you to the top of the \"T\". A circle where the edge of the circle only touches the edge of the straight ahead, same radius, image plane where that circle touches that plane straight ahead. So if you stood there & rotated a few degrees at a time & took photos: Each photo would have the CENTER in focus at that distance. Because lenses for cameras like the 1's we use are -----> DESIGNED !!!  to produce a flat image plane at a right angle from a line from the camera/lens to the point of focus: When a person focuses off center with a wide angle lens the ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT can become quite large so that: When a person turns the camera/lens back to compose: The distance that had originally been focused on has become a small portion of the new distance to where the image plane has moved to. I do not have the technical equipment to put a diagram on the screen. The further the angle of the subject focused on is: From the line going thru the center of the composition: The further away from the plane of focus the subject originally focused on will be. Because the actual plane of focus will EFFECTIVELY move further & further away from the subject originally focused on the FURTHER away from the center of the line of composition that the original subject is. The plane of focus of the original subject will EFFECTIVELY move CLOSER to the camera.

I also own a M9M but I've donated it on a \" it's your's for as long as you need it\" loan to a friend in South Africa who's B&W work deserved the uptick. The M10-P was a Wetzlar upgrade from the regular M10, that for me was a good move and I like to recycle stuff it at all possible rather than trade in / up. 24 megapixels are enough for me as I easily get A2 size prints from the files, sometimes even larger when I farm out that print work. I was given a trial of the M10-R about a year or so ago and I saw no real advantages for me in it's sensor and one disadvantage, the well discussed here motion problem that necessitates use of higher shutter speed to counter. The M10-M is a wonderful beast, no need to elaborate on that fact, and I love the M10-D as one adores, despite the problems it brings to ownership, the adopted dog that isn't quite housetrained and keeps running away to it's original home. I see little reason to upgrade from what I have in digital M's, I don't need more megapixels, I'm happy enough with the sensor, the M10 body is close to perfect and it's functionality leaves very little to desire. Anyway more megapixels would probably mean me having to upgrade my computing gear too, a hidden expense that I don't want to have to plumb for at this time.........Instead, in the past couple of years, I have invested in analogue cameras again with an M-A last year and a MP a month or so ago, they join my M7 that I had completely overhauled and it's VF upgraded at Wetzlar last year. The other \"upgrade\" is the building of a darkroom I've just finished here at home for film process only, ( I will continue to print with the two A2 size Epsons, one with regular full spectrum inks the other for monochrome only with the Jon Cone / Piezography Pro ink-set ). My personal work will now mainly be in film and then as a small bonus I can also bring back into play my trusty Pentax 67 and the various Nikon film Pro' cameras that I've never sold on even after their use died away when digital came on the scene.

The possible mechanicals difficulties on a digital Leica are: 1) as the name suggests, with dual ranges, the DR has two separate focusing cam surfaces (on one cylindrical cam). Using the long-distance range (1m > infinity) the closeup cam, now in the bottom of the lens, can jam or rub against the meter housing on the floor of the M10 shutter chamber as one focuses close to infinity. In my case, this happened only in the last fraction of a mm before reaching infinity, and it did not completely jam; the focusing just got a bit stiffer (and the lens left a little rub-mark inside the M10). 2) The close-up goggles won't always clip completely into place, unless the little black rubber \"bumper\" on the back of the goggles is trimmed to fit (see your picture, black bumper is just peeking over the top, above and behind the words \"Leitz Wetzlar.\" To focus closer than 1 meter, the goggles MUST be mounted on the lens (they unlock the close-focus action by pressing on the \"ball bearing\" on top of the lens mount - see your photo). The whole point of the DR lens and goggles is to focus close using the regular rangefinder and no other accessories. But it can be used with live-view or EVF - still needs the goggles mounted, though, to unlock the closeup range. It is also a bit heavier than most M 50mm f/2s, due to the 1950s build-quality, and the extra metal for extended focusing. At normal focusing distances (1m > infinity) I found the DR to be at least as good, and often better, than more modern 50mm Summicrons - at f/2.0. Stopped down, the differences decrease. Certainly for a 1950s design, it holds up extremely well with age. I.E. I mostly agree with Rockwell's evaluation. In the close range, as with most lenses -----> designed !!!  for longer distances, it is a bit soft at f/2.0, but very sharp stopped down. I used mine in the studio and for other close-range work for a couple of months - and still sell prints from some of its images.

I switched from the M-D to an M10-D. It was a bit a spur for the moment kind of thing and I did a trade incl cash. After about 6 months I had some small regrets. Not that I was not happy with the M10-D, quite the contrary, and the pros you mention (except for the screen ) all apply. My regrets were on my feeling that the differences seemed small and not really worth the money. Then a year later I borrowed an M246 for a weekend. And to be honest, in that weekend for me it confirmed that the M10-D was a step up from the MD 262. In retrospect I discovered the pros indeed were larger (for me personally) than I thought. I really prefer the slimmer body, the better viewfinder and another typical M10-D characteristic (faux lever). The better ISO performance is a plus too, but in real life not a game changer. That also counts the other way around regarding battery life. The M-D has better battery life, but in using the M10-D it is not an issue. Mostly I get by with one battery anyway. I think all these things will also count for the regular M10 (except for the screen less thing...). So if you trade, I advise you to do it enjoy it and don't look back.

Image sensors all only have one \"real\" ISO, called the base ISO. Which -----> creates !!!  the optimal and most efficient sensor output - one photon in knocks loose one electron to be captured and counted, with no overflow. For the M10 24Mpixel color sensor, this is about \"ISO 135-ish\" according to Leica. An analogy would be - put a needle on a rotating vinyl/wax sound recording, and the needle will vibrate and put out a given amount of sound all by itself. That is its \"base volume.\" The original \"phonographs\" amplified the sound with a megaphone or trumpet - eventually electrical devices were used to amplify the vibrations (or \"signal\") instead. --img--  All the other ISOs a digital camera may offer come from processing the base ISO image with additional processing chips. Amplifying or \"pushing\" it to a higher ISO get a usable image using less light, or to a lesser extent subduing it with de-amplification (\"pulling\") to get a lower apparent ISO, a stronger signal and thus slightly less noise (better signal/noise ratio). I guess those could be called \"virtual ISOs.\" But I've never head that term used. The ability to \"pull\" a digital image is very limited, since the base ISO is already using the full capacity of the sensor's \"pixel wells\" that store the electrons, and adding more light very quickly overflows the capacity of the wells to distinguish bright things, leading to \"blown\" highlights without detail. On the basic M10, ISO 100 is a slight \"pull\" of the base ISO, and ISO 200 or higher are \"pushes\" of the base ISO (weaker and weaker native signals (sensor exposed to less light than optimal), amplified more and more, and thus acquiring more and more noise.) And for whatever reason (probably to maintain even steps: 100, 200, 400, etc., on the mechanical ISO knob), Leica does not allow accessing and using the actual base ISO. ................... As to digital ISO compared to film ISO, the ISO (International Organization for Standards) standards for measuring each are completely different. Film ISOs are determined by measuring shadow density (although Ilford, for example, doesn't use the ISO method, for their own films). Digital ISOs are measured differently based on signal, noise, midtones - and only for .jpgs, since each photographer will do their own processing with raw of .DNG files). Nevertheless, in practical use, they are generally close, so that an external independent light meter, which has no idea what camera one is using, should produce equally-bright pictures from the same light, subject, and manual camera settings. The only way to really test that is a direct comparison with a color slide film of ISO 100 (no printing corrections allowed) and a digital .jpg taken at the same aperture and shutter speed at ISO 100 (no photographer post-processing - \"straight from the camera\"). The ISO organization doesn't come close to doing such a test, and I suspect most camera makers don't bother, either. DxO claims their testing system comes close, but it's still based on a \"virtual\" mathematical model, not shooting Velvia 100 alongside an M10 or the other cameras they test.

This is because the rangefinder, unlike a view camera, SLR, or EVF camera, does not inspect the lens\u2019 image directly to evaluate focus. Instead, one mechanism gauges distance to subject (the wheel at the top of the shutter box and the mechanics it attaches to in the camera, and the ring that moves in and out of the inside of the mount of the lens), and an independent mechanism adjusts the lens to focus at that distance (the distance between sensor and lens mount in the camera, including film plane flatness where relevant, and the movement of the optical cell(s) relative to the mount in the lens). Both systems must agree in box camera and lens to achieve optimum focus. This is a surprisingly complex problem. Possibilities that come to mind for a system that focuses past infinity in the center of the frame include: It might be working as intended. The lens might have field curvature and the lens designer optimized it to attain maximum resolution, i.e. to be in focus, in a ring around the center of the image, not the axis or corners. With recent lenses, you might look at the MTF curves; in the curve for the appropriate aperture, if the lowest dashed/solid pair of curves slopes upward from the left edge before falling down toward the right edge, then this behavior can be expected (but is unlikely to be visible when viewing the full image). It might be working as intended, part two: the lens was calibrated to place focus in the middle of the thickness of a sheet of film, but it is being used on a digital sensor which does not behave as if it has thickness. In this case, the lens is effectively focusing behind the sensor, so focusing closer (moving the lens away from the sensor) -----> improves !!!  resolution. It might be working as intended, part three: all lenses have aberrations, some of these aberrations occur mostly in front of or behind the focus plane, and some of those are reduced when changing aperture. Removing aberrations in front of the focus plane will shift optimum focus backwards without changing actual focus at all. Designers of lenses with this focus shift behavior must choose which aperture the focus setting is optimized for. It might be working as intended, part four: our metal lenses are more responsive to temperature changes than a well-designed plastic housing, so hot or cold temperatures have elongated/constricted enough material to change focus. I haven\u2019t heard of this in practice, though; or, if it has changed enough to alter focus, the photographer has more pressing issues. It is working as intended, part five: your demand for focus has exceeded the design specifications. This may well be expected of extreme lenses: 135/3.4, 90/2, 50/1.2 lenses or with wider aperture might be within allowable tolerances yet still not perform well together. Changing both or either might improve performance in that equipment pairing yet impair performance of the calibrated device with most other M systems. Neither are working as intended, but they both agree with each other, mostly. To make the system work, all M lenses and cameras are designed to align within a given tolerance of a certain specification. But the spec doesn\u2019t matter so long as the parts interacting do so agreeably. This is why testing multiple items helps identify the problem: if you have lens A, lens B, and camera 1, and two of them agree with each other but not the third, most likely the third would benefit from calibration. The camera is miscalibrated for focus throw: the shouldn\u2019t be a problem at infinity, but might be at any other distance. The camera is miscalibrated for infinity: all properly calibrated lenses tend to show the same error. Adjusting camera will improve its performance with most lenses. The lens is miscalibrated for focus throw: some lenses have been modified by people who didn\u2019t understand the system; sometimes this can be fixed by rotating the modified part out of the way. The lens is miscalibrated for infinity: as above or can be adjusted with shims. The camera and/or lens are misaligned. This can be expected with devices that show significant dents, and also when using imprecise adapters. So, there can be no generic answer to satisfy this kind of problem. It is not uncommon for rangefinder shooters to learn that lens a at aperture b needs to be adjusted like so when working at distance c, and so forth. I know that this is not a satisfying answer, but it is part of the package deal when extracting such high image quality from mechanical devices of this size."}, {"autor": "SiggiGun", "posts": "736 posts", "date": "05/31/2021 07:25  AM", "content": "vor 1 Stunde schrieb evikne: It is rumored that a new and -----> improved !!!

In my presentation in the forum I already mentioned it, but since surely few saw it, I will repeat some things as context for my doubt. I started taking photographs as a child, with analog cameras of my father that I no longer remember. I learned the basics of analog development as a teenager (I am currently close to 50) and after a long history about 20 years ago I was increasingly opting for Canon digital ones. From a cheap Canon EOS to full frame 5D, 5DII, 6D, 5DIII and some nice L lenses etc\u2026. A few years ago, rather due to the need for a small business, I needed a smaller camera that would record good video, so I opted for a Sony A7RII, thinking that in addition to making good videos it would have a higher resolution than what I knew so far. From that moment I discovered the wonder of mirrorless cameras, basically because of the possibility of using any lens, from the oldest and rarest to the most modern\u2026. that led me to the leica world ... and once I had some R's and a couple of M's, curiosity led me to try more and more alternatives. All this at the same time led me to buy my first analog camera in many years\u2026 a leicaflex to use my R lenses\u2026. and go back to the dark room of my childhood ... and since I was -----> developing !!!  my own negatives why not the medium format ... and buy a Mamiya, and since I love the medium format why not hasselblad .... And since I have M lenses that have cost me an arm and a leg, why not an M body, and then a Leica M3 and then a Leica M9\u2026. I imagine this is a story known to many\u2026. well then \u2026. I currently have an M3, an M9, an X2, a Licea CL analog and a Leica CL digital, all my Canon cameras, all my canon lenses, several Ricohs, analog and digital, an Olympus 35, a Nikon FE2, a Canon A1, one Minolta quartz two Hasselblad (500 EXL and 501 CM). Needless to say about the lenses\u2026 but in a leica M mount a 50 Summicron v3, a 50 Summicron v4, a 90 Elmerit tele M, an old 90 mm f4, a 35 mm Sumaron 3.5, several Voitglanders, several 7Artisan and TTArtisan\u2026. etc etc etc \u2026\u2026 The point is that I love my cameras and my lenses, I use them all, but the experience of the Leica M and my question\u2026 to conclude\u2026 is\u2026. should I sell some cameras and lenses to buy a hopefully unused Leica m10R and a pair of M lenses or should I sell my Rolex (which I hardly ever use) to buy a Leica M10R and some lenses\u2026.

I cant help but feel its not giving me the same experience I got from the M. I also find it too heavy as a system to carry for long hikes and trips and I really miss the M at those times. Similar situation. I recently bought into my 4th medium format system. I understand heavy The reason I really want to upgrade are: 3) Ability to crop with higher MP so I could travel with just a 35mm and maybe a 90mm Been experimenting with such a thing myself. I used an M240 and a 28, 50, and a 90 the last time we went to France. Much more pleasant than a pro body Nikon and three pro zooms. We do mostly castles, cathedrals, ruins, that sort of thing. 24mp was sufficient for the things I wanted to crop, but not enough for architectural details. I'm probably going to try something similar with a Hasselblad X1d II and a 45, 65, and 90. Hopefully, the larger sensor will partially make up for lack of a really long lens.

The camera housing has a particularly scratch-resistant dark green finish and is covered with Kevlar fabric - the synthetic fiber that is also used to produce ballistic protective clothing. The M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is available at specialist retailers and only 450 units will be available worldwide. Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d: A homage to the great reportage photographers of our time Wetzlar, January 21, 2021. As part of the celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the Leica Oskar Barnack Award, Leica Camera AG presents a special design variant of the Leica M10-P: the M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is an uncompromising reportage camera, suitable for even the most challenging conditions. Many Leica cameras throughout the company\u2019s history have been -----> developed !!!  with the needs of press and reportage photographers in mind. This is illustrated by exceptional models such as the Leica 250 of 1933, whose film cassette accommodated 250 exposures, or the Leica MP of 1956 \u2013 a Leica M3 variant which was equipped with the Leicavit rapid winder, following the suggestions of renowned photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt (1898\u2013 1995) and David Douglas Duncan (1916\u20132018). With its dark green, particularly scratch-resistant finish and Kevlar camera trim, the Leica M10- P \u201cReporter\u201d brings to mind the extremely challenging conditions under which many of the most remarkable reportages of our time were created. Kevlar is a synthetic fibre frequently used in the production of ballistic protective clothing. Through exposure to natural UV rays, the camera\u2019s body armour will gradually turn the same colour as its top and base plate. The armour\u2019s diamond-weave texture makes the Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d especially grippy and comfortable to hold. All of the camera\u2019s engravings are inlaid in light green, resulting in a more discreet effect than the white inlays customarily used on black-finish cameras. In terms of its technical specifications, the M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is identical to the serially produced Leica M10- P. The Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is available at specialist retailers. A total of 450 units of the Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d will be available worldwide. --img-- "}, {"autor": "wlaidlaw", "posts": "17,794 posts", "date": "05/23/2021 05:03  PM", "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) 2 hours ago, pedaes said: Why after Smear Away?

Incredible - when I applied enough pressure to that part of my finger to release the shutter, the camera remained rock still! I tried it over and over - amazing! So for 50 years I've been doing this wrong. I had to slide my index finger just a little bit further over the shutter release - still need to practice. I need to make this a habit from now on. To me, it \"looks\" wrong, and it \"feels\" wrong, but there is no doubt about it - when the shutter is released, the camera didn't move, or at least not enough that I could see it. Until now, I used the ball of my finger outboard of the first joint. I thought the idea was to do that, rather than have my finger pointing down, and use my finger like a plunger.

They need in-camera corrections applied to the picture files to remove the purple corners. This is why Leica has provided \"6-bit\" coding marks on their own lenses since 2006, and offers upgrades to add the coding to some older lenses, back to about 1980. So that the digital cameras will know what focal length you are using, and can then correct for the specific pattern of purple corners (which varies from lens type to lens type). The problem is called \"Italian Flag syndrome\" because in many cases the color shifts are red/purple on one side, and greenish on the other side. Note that SOME older wide-angles are very difficult to correct for. The Leica 21mm Super-Angulon f/3.4-f/4 lenses from the 1960s always produce strong purple corners, as does the Voigtlander 15mm from 1997 and the Zeiss 15mm Hologon from the 1960s. They are simply incompatible with color digital image sensors. http://www.kenrockwell.com/leica/images/m9/examples/21mm-f4/L1001261-21mm-f4.jpg Leica does not offer corrections -----> designed !!!  specifically for lenses made by someone else: Minolta, Zeiss, Voigtlander, Canon or Nikon LTM, etc. But sometimes a correction for a Leica lens will produce \"pretty good\" results with those lenses. As a first try at fixing this problem: with your Minolta lens mounted, open your M10's Main menu and go to the very first menu item: \"Lens Detection.\" Go into that menu item, and select \"Manual M\" and you will see a long list of LEICA M lenses. Scroll through the list to find \"21mm f/2.8 11134\" - this setting provides the strongest purple-removal in the corners, which your lens will likely need - even though it is just a 28mm lens. Press the \"Info\" button on the camera to set that as the active lens correction. This is the M typ 240 lens menu - the M10 menu is identical except for the background color: http://www.waloszek.de/m240/lens_list_manual/DSC06080_600.jpg Then take some pictures and see if the purple corners have been eliminated adequately. If you find the corners are now too green, you can try a milder correction from the same menu - perhaps the setting for \"28 f/2.8 11804.\" For solving this problem, the actual focal length chosen is not important - what you need is the correct pattern of purple removal, and since you lens is not from Leica originally, that may be a correction for a Leica 21 or 24 or 28, or even something else. Experimentation is free, and you will not damage anything by trying any or all of the settings. If you want deeper technical details about why this occurs with small wideangle rangefinder lenses on Leica digital cameras, we can give you that. The very short explanation is, the shallow body of Leica M cameras compared to SLRs, and how close these small lenses like your Minolta come to the sensor, and the shallow angle of incidence with which their light rays hit the sensor in the far corners. Combined with the \"checkerboard\" of microscopic color filters (Bayer pattern) that allow digital sensors to see in color.

It is a flat, thin, homogenous layer of light-sensitive silver compounds evenly distributed and suspended in translucent gelatin, smoothly coated on a base material (usually plastic) for strength. In modern (post-1935) color film there are three stacked layers for the three primary colors to be recorded (red, green, blue). It has a very simple and unorganized structure, relatively speaking. Any square micron of the emulsion is effectively identical to any other square micron. It is equally sensitive to light coming from any direction (except perhaps the back --img--  ), at any angle. Therefore, in the 150 years or so that camera lenses were -----> designed !!!  with film (or a coated glass plate) as the expected \"target\" for their projected light rays, little attention was paid to the imaging surface. It did not have any \"special needs\" to be considered ,and was assumed to simply respond as intended to any image projected on it. At least for general-purpose photography - special films and special lenses for technical or scientific work may have paid more precise attention to details. Next let us look at how the 28mm G-Rokkor or other compact short-focus lenses for Leica-type camera bodies work. One advantage of the Leica and other rangefinder cameras (and, of course, the recent \"mirrorless\" cameras) is that there is nothing inside the camera between the lens and the film except about 3mm of \"shutter curtains.\" (Unlike SLRs, which need about 40-45mm of space between the lens and shutter for the reflex mirror to flip up and down). Leica cameras and the lenses for them standardize on about 28mm between the lens mount and the film, with the lenses often protruding even deeper into the camera than the mount (as your 28mm G-Rokkor does): http://www.9days.hk/uploads/product/13F047_03.jpg But what really matters is that your lens and similar 28mm lenses capture a view of the world that is 65\u00b0 wide across the long dimension of a 24x36 negative or sensor. And in designs for the Leica, the lenses are relatively symmetrical, so that the light coming out of the lens at the back to hit the film also covers a total angle of about 65\u00b0. At each end of a horizontal picture, the light from the edges of your subject area is thus hitting the film (or sensor) at an angle of about 32.5\u00b0 from the vertical - the \"angle of incidence.\" http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/AngleOfIncidence_800.gif Light passing straight through the lens from the center of the subject to the center of the film or sensor has an angle of incidence of zero. As we mentioned, film is relatively insensitive to the incoming angle of light rays, so lens designers knew that almost any angle of incidence would work. Unlike film, digital sensors have a very complex and non-homogenous 3D microscopic structure of silicon, glass, colored filters, etc. If one thinks of film as a smooth meadow, a digital sensor is like an inner city, divided up into blocks of tall buildings (on a microscopic scale). The net result is that digital sensors are far more \"sensitive\" than film to angle of incidence, and thus misbehave with lenses with a large angle of incidence at the picture edges/corners, that worked perfectly well on film. On the whole, current digital sensors work best when the angle of incidence is closer to zero. Horizontally, sensors are divided up into squares - the pixels - each with different color filtering, the Bayer pattern or Bayer filter array. One key point suspected in the \"Italian Flag\" problem is that the Bayer filter pattern is not symmetrical - the blue pixels are always biased to one side while the red pixels are biased to the other side, no matter how you turn the pattern: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Bayer_pattern.svg/2000px-Bayer_pattern.svg.png Vertically, sensors are divided up into several layers, and most importantly, the imaging areas of the silicon (D and E) are not flat and homogenous, but deep \"wells\" divided by solid-state circuitry. Additionally important to the purple-corner problem is the existence of microlenses (F) capping each pixel, to refocus light down into the \"wells\". http://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2010/08/Sensors1.jpg This diagram demonstrates one current idea about what may cause the purple-corners or Italian-flag effects - leakage and/or reflection of light already filtered for one color (in this case green) into a neighboring pixel programmed to measure a different color (in this case blue). Due to the gaps between the vertical layers, the vertical structures, and the angle at which the incoming light hits the microlenses or the underlying silicon. And resulting in excess blue signal on one side of the picture, and (due to the bias of the Bayer pattern) excess red signal on the opposite side of the picture. http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Wiring-diagram-for-a-typical-front-illuminated-sensor.gif Here are some real-world photomicrographs of an image sensor that may help clarify what the schematics above are showing, especially the 3D \"wiring\" etched into the silicon: https://petapixel.com/2013/02/12/what-a-dslrs-cmos-sensor-looks-like-under-a-microscope/ You may ask why Sony and other mirrorless cameras and lenses do not have as much problem as Leica's lenses. And the answer is, Sony and Fuji and Olympus have -----> designed !!!  their mirrorless-system lenses specifically for digital sensors right from the beginning, with optics that reduce the angles of incidence. Your G-Rokkor and my 1981 21mm Elmarit-M were not -----> designed !!!  for use with digital sensors (although fortunately Leica goes to some lengths to achieve significant backwards compatability through their camera corrections. At least for their own lenses, and coincidentally, sometimes for others') Edited December 25, 2017 by adan"}, {"autor": "adan", "posts": "10,775 posts", "date": "12/25/2017 06:36  PM", "content": "A brief follow-up on \"lenses -----> designed !!!  for digital.\" Here is a diagram of a 8mm-30mm zoom lens -----> designed !!!  for a (small) digital sensor, as in a Leica C or D-Lux P&S (or similar cameras from Nikon, Canon etc.). Note the path of the edge or corner light rays (blue) at the wide-angle focal length (8mm, bottom). That path is NOT symmetrical - the light from the subject comes in at a wide angle (~35\u00b0 from each side), but after passing through the lens, exits the lens and strikes the sensor at an angle of incidence of less than 10\u00b0, unlike our old film-era rangefinder wide-angles. This is called a \"telecentric\" lens design. https://image.slidesharecdn.com/azoomlensdesignmethodjuly32013-131211180539-phpapp02/95/a-zoom-lens-design-method-july-3-2013-10-638.jpg?cb=1386786948 I can't find a ray-tracing diagram for the Leica Vario-Elmarit-SL 24-90 lens - but I am sure that that lens, -----> designed !!!  in the digital era, behaves the same way, and thus even at 24mm, and on the same sensor size, does not produce the purple edges of old film 28/21 lenses on M cameras. Could Leica design new \"telecentric\" lenses for the Leica M digitals? Certainly. But one characteristic of telecentric lenses is that they are generally very large relative to the size of the image area. The Vario-Elmarit 24-90 is larger and heavier than the SL camera itself. That would run contrary to the whole point of the M cameras. It is probable that the Leica-M 21 and 24 Summilux f/1.4 lenses, -----> designed !!!  in the digital era, and already large due to the aperture and angle of view, have some telecentricity -----> designed !!!  into them. SLR camera makers got lucky when it came to digital. Their wide-angle film lenses, even those -----> designed !!!  decades before digital sensors existed, already come with a certain amount of telecentricity built in. Because, to clear the swinging mirror, those lenses needed asymmetrical retrofocus designs (back focus distance substantially longer than the nominal focal length). Note the difference in angle of incidence (b ) delivered by a retrofocus wide-angle (top) and a shorter, more symmetrical wide-angle (bottom) - I'm guessing this compares the Zeiss Distagon 21mm for Contax SLRs, and the Zeiss G-Biogon 21mm for the Contax G1/G2 \"AF rangefinder\" cameras: http://pic.enorth.com.cn/0/03/48/96/3489683_304673.gif Mount a Leica R (or other SLR) 15/19/21/24/28/35 on the M10, and even without coding or menu identification, they will likely avoid any purple corners. The one SLR exception is tilt-shift lenses, where by dialing the lens off-center for perspective or DOF control, the angle of incidence may get very large in one direction or another - that will sometimes cause purple corners or Italian Flag color distortions even with SLR cameras. https://c4.staticflickr.com/3/2740/4278462691_ac24130c05_z.jpg Phase One's Capture One Pro program has a module for LCC (lens cast correction) that builds profiles of purple-corner problems due to off-center T/S lenses, and corrects for them https://i2.wp.com/blog.phaseone.com/wp-content/uploads/Tip902-Img7-full.jpg?ssl=1 Edited December 25, 2017 by adan"}, {"autor": "KFo", "posts": "204 posts", "date": "02/19/2020 04:56  PM", "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) I\u2019m wondering if any of you have heard anything about a shutter button failures on M10P.

Not for video, but for dealing with highlights. I'm thinking about the degree to which one has to underexpose with the M10 when shooting into the light or with strong sidelight, sometimes as much as 2 stops. It seems to me that, compared to the M10-R for example, the overall the dynamic range of the M10 is the same, or even a smidgeon greater; but the distribution of the DR is weighted more to shadows than to highlights. That is, I believe, what makes people say that the DR of the M10-R \"better\". In other words, I would prefer if Leica had applied a different, flatter, contrast curve to the M10 DNGs \u2014 possibly that could be done in a firmware upgrade, although highly unlikely. But in a new M11, I would expect this issue would be solved and could make the highlight treatment more like shooting negative film. Until then, I think the M10 is great. _______________________Frog Leaping photobook The point is whether to freeze one line at 24mp but -----> improve !!!  DR, colour depth, ISO, etc. I think this is sensible. Faster speeds are needed with higher resolution to keep pixel level sharpness. If you loose this at 41mp, you might as well have had 24mp.

CL is lighter and less expensive so I feel less protective about it (with Elmarit 28).

Quite hard to judge with the big black blob, though, as the main subject determines the quality of the image.

As an example: here is an image where the camera managed to capture both the detail in the midday Mozambique sun in the background and in the deep shadows of the kitchen. Th 13 stops or so of the CL were sufficient. But the need to compress the range to something you can see on your monitor pushed the image to the verge of a HDR look.

Hello Murdog and welcome to the Forum.......I presently own a MD-10, ( plus a M7 like yourself ), and despite some quirks it is perhaps my favourite digital M so regarding the choices of camera I would definitely go with the M10-D over the MD 262, and here's a couple of reasons why......The better VF, the slimmer nicely balanced body, and the sensitivity and DR of the sensor is improved over the 240/262 in my opinion, ( I used to own a M240 before trading up to the M10's ), PLUS although I first thought that the faux winding lever was a really stupid \"throwback\" idea I'm now completely won over with it to the extent that I wish all other future M's would offer the same thing. I never liked the rear on/off/WiFi switch from day one, I wish that it was in the \"normal\" M position around the shutter release, but I've gotten used to it I guess now. The reliance on Foto's to make changes to the camera setup is also an annoyance for me, but having settled on the best settings for your shooting preferences you can just leave all that alone. I've not changed my M10-D's settings for more than 8 months or so. The fact that you can use the Visoflex 020 with the M10-D may also be a plus for you. I have one, I don't like it on the M's but others do find it a very handy accessory. Lenses? Frankly I think you've got two that are easily way good enough to start with, especially so the 28mm Elmarit which to my mind is one of Leica's best M lenses, also you may find that after using the M10-D for a while that perhaps you do not need to have a fast Summilux 50mm. I personally have found that since going into the M10 range of cameras I have been able to use smaller, marginally slower, lenses without any problem and to my mind the M balances so much better in the hand with the smaller lenses, ( like your present 28mm Elmarit ), larger faster lenses tend to block the VF more too which can be annoying.....they are also quite a lot more expensive! I'd recommend you looking at a 50mm Summarit when you are considering a 50mm, the Summaries are great little lenses and balance beautifully on the cameras.

I think the points you make are very valid and kind of take me back down to earth. I mostly only get the chance to shoot at night and being so used to my M7, a faster lens was my reasoning for the 50 or maybe a 28 summicron. But as you say, with the ISO capability of the m10-D, maybe my 28 Elmarit will be good enough. I love this lens and love the size on my M7.

It got me thinking that, while you may be taught the technology of photography, as a learned skill, your imagination is yours.

I adopted - rationally (my rationale anyway) - a two system approach using Fujifilm's X and GFX platforms, all native lenses. I liked the manual controls, the lightweight of the X system, and the IQ of the GFX100. In practice, I've gone into a creative slump. The X system doesn't inspire, and the GFX system is too much of a big lump, so in the end I grab neither when leaving the house. (To be clear, both systems are brilliant, just as almost everything made today, right?) So, after almost 2 years out, I find myself back round the block looking again at the Leica M system. Why? I know its limitations, and for me they are made worse now by the fact that in the intervening 2 years my eyesight has worsened, and I'd need to wear glasses while focusing the OVF. But I always found the M system pleasurable to use, and would often find myself picking up, and taking out the M without a clear objective in mind... just get going. My last M was the M10. I thought it was brilliant. There wasn't really anything much I would have wanted more (except perhaps IBIS, but we are told the wizards cannot do that spell yet, or perhaps ever). And, having \"looked away\" for a couple of years, I'm only now catching up on what has come since - the M10-D, M10-P, M10-M, M10-R, etc. It made me smile to see that the M engineers are still working on improvements, without losing what the M is all about. So, I'm pondering what to get, starting in the M system again completely from scratch. There's are lens choices to make. I've used most key ones - modern Karbe-era ones, older Mandler-era classics, and older ones still - on MM, M246, M240, and M10. The latest fast/enormous ones I haven't tried, but back when I had multi Leica systems, I found my 50NX better suited to my SL than my M. Many are better skilled at focusing at f/0.95 with a rangefinder patch than me, even with lens/body alignment assured. So for lenses, I have a shortlist in mind. Where I find myself still trying to work things out is the current crop of bodies. I've seen some of the tests, and debate on M10-P v M10-R v M10M. Clearly no one is buying the Monochrom unless they want at least a good chunk of their efforts to go to B&W output. But I'm also more persuaded by those who say the technological advantages the M10M might have aren't for them the main reason they bought it - rather its because carrying the M10M forces you to \"see\" black and white images, to pre-visualise, because you can't hedge your bets later in PP. When I had the MM and M246 I found my B&W work -----> improving !!!  because I was focused on light and shape. I also enjoyed being able to attach colour filters to lenses and play around with that. Some argue that having the colour channels info in your RAW file at PP gives more options in processing than a Monochrom file - you have these channels to slide around, absent in the Monochrom files. Some say the M10(-P) files have more latitude in them, other say the M10R files do. Some point to the challenge of rangefinder photography at higher resolution - human errors are amplified (shake, mis-focus). I didn't pose a question in the title of this post because I'm not quite sure what mine are yet. I guess at this point I'm interested in comments from experienced M users who have considered an M body purchase in the past year or two. What were your considerations, what did you choose, and has the experience of the new body delivered what you thought it would? Also, if you bought an M10R or M10M, did the higher resolution lead you to like certain lenses more, or less, than on lower resolution bodies? And, FWIW, I'll update here too what I end up getting. It's nice to be (almost) back. Happy New Year!"}, {"autor": "chasdfg", "posts": "185 posts", "date": "01/08/2021 11:37  AM", "content": "I purchased 2 Ms in the past year and completely understand what's going on (or so i think i do) . Basically i used an M240 for the most part of 5 years, itched for something new and went through Sony, Canon, Fuji GFX, Sigma FP, Leica SL/2 cameras before realising I just want to shoot with Leica bodies, and within that brand, preferably M cameras (I only like shooting with M glass so an M camera is best for this, along with the form factor of the body, physical dials, simple button layout, etc.). My process wasn't as \"clean\" as yours in that I still had my M lenses and 1 of my 2 current M bodies whilst going through all those other bodies and systems. In any case, it was plenty of soul searching of sorts and a very restless time gear wise. I'm now perfectly contented with my M10M and M10D, two cameras which I feel compliment each other well. I had always wanted a monochrom and was always drawn to the idea of learning how to shoot in b&w as I never had the discipline to convert my pictures to b&w in post. Likewise, i was always drawn to the idea of a screen-less M. Not that I had any major issues with chimping (or so i didn't think i did, until i got the M10D last month). I chose those 2 cameras because I felt they could teach me more than a colour M could alone. People might dismiss the idea that seeing in black and white changes how you shoot, but I've experienced it first hand, as have you. One is forced to think of better ways to draw the viewer's eye. I move more, I look for stronger lines, contrast and shadow more. It's a subtle shift but it's there. The M10D has made me make sure I get the shot when I'm \"getting the shot\". I don't take for granted that I'm shooting digital so much any more. Being forced to shoot differently with these two cameras has made me -----> improve !!!  more than any other camera has, aside from my initial few years with the M240 and with my Nikons when I first started photography. I may be a marketing victim, or convincing myself I made the right choices with the M10M and M10D, but hey if I feel a difference in my shooting and I'm enjoying this hobby more, isn't only relevant barometer the level of satisfaction I derive from using this gear? It's a breath of fresh air and I'm loving it. It's never going to be sensible in the grand scheme of things, to spend money on Leica gear. If I was rational and wanted just one M, I'd have gone with an M10R. If I was rational and just wanted a camera a Nikon Z (or even a DSLR from yesteryears) would suffice. Have the two cameras delivered what I thought they would? Absolutely. And I feel I have plenty to grow into and any limitations are on me. The beauty of the monochroms and the D versions is that you're paying a high price of entry for the concept and way of shooting they promote. It's kinda like paying the high price of entry for an M, but this time a niche within the niche. Once you own a mono/D, even if a new model comes out, the incentives would merely be technological. With cameras this good these days, and with the M10 form factor, it'd be hard to make me give these up for a newer version. I suppose one could argue that if you want to buy the concept, then an M246 and M-D262 would be most economical - however having used the M10 series cameras, I don't think I could go back to the M240 body size and buttons (for M246). Speaking of GFX and Ms, one big reason why I got it was the 40mp bayerless sensor. After my experience with the GFX 50S, I was bitten by the high MP bug. Not because I print big or leave sloppy composition to be fixed in post, but because every time I zoomed in past 100% in my GFX files, I saw so much it was downright fascinating that I could see all these \"new\" details I was capturing. You might appreciate the M10M or M10R on this basis alone, having come from the GFX100. On lenses on the cameras: I've kinda \"been there, done that\" with most lenses I've wanted. I owned/used fast glass, modern glass, vintage glass, limited edition lenses and sorted through what I wanted in my kit and got rid of the rest. Sometimes I feel I should have kept some of the glass I sold cause I took a while to acquire them, not to forget the adage about never selling Leica lenses. But the clutter bothered me more than the idea of selling them. I more than halved my kit and I now \"only\" have 5. 3 core lenses (28cron, 35FLE, 50APO) and 2 \"extra\"/superfluous ones (50 f1, 75lux) for portraits/Mandler days. My main pairing on the M10M tends to be a 28cron and 50APO. Both of these lenses have great clarity and don't embellish photos excessively, much in line with how I view my black and white shooting (no colours, fancy bokeh to spice up the pictures, but lines, shadows and contrast). One side thing I realised with the M10M is I prefer 28mm or 50mm on b&w whilst I prefer 35mm in colour (or prefer 28mm and 50mm less in colour?). Haven't really figured this one out yet, but it might have to do with 28mm giving more room to compose different angles, and 50mm giving an extra tightness to draw the viewer in. I do admit the 40mp sensor does make me want to put the 50APO on more than any other lens, because it can eek out the extra details. I often get pleasant surprises in my photos when I zoom in. This said, I have used Mandler glass on the M10M due to the charm of shooting oldish glass with b&w. With my glass and the M10M, it's very much \"same same but different\", in a pleasant way. I suppose I'm not really answering your higher MP camera + certain lenses question though, since my response has a b&w slant to it. My 35FLE lives on the M10D. Not much to say about this, as that lens could live on any M and I'd be happy camper (being a 35mm guy). Apologies for the long post. I tend to get carried away when talking about cameras...a little too carried away...(I could do a summary if that helps?)

You wrote you already have your lens short list. Me ? I'd start off again with a 35mm and a 50mm. Test the waters with this kit to make sure the Leica Rangefinder system is still everything you remember it to be to include the motivation to get out there! It really is one click of one button in Lightroom to switch from color to B&W. If you find yourself converting most of your M10-R Color images to B&W, I would then consider adding the M10-M. ** I've always worn my glasses when using the RF patch and thankful I can.

I'd forgotten (forgive me!) how much I enjoyed chatting with other photography nuts here on this forum. \ud83d\ude42 chasdfg - so much of your experience seems familiar to me! Regarding the M10D, I really smiled when I saw that one. I can't claim to have been part of the clamour here from those who imagined this camera, but I was one of those persuaded by it. I bought, and reported on the M60 - kind of the beta release for this, and I also had and reported here on the M-D (typ262). The same concept in M10 form has appeal I really get. But I also learned - especially with the M-D, the sometimes I like to frame and shoot, slightly arms length from the rear screen, and it is useful to have that option. But... I get it. The M246 I never really gelled with, and in fact while I owned that one I \"downgraded\" to the MM, which really made the MM's antiquated feel stand out, not to mention that \"guh jjjjjjrrrrrrrr\" after the shutter release. But there is - to this day - something about the MM files, and when I happen upon them in my catalogue they really stand out. I can imagine, in a return to the M, even if I had an M10M, I would still consider an MM, just as much and for the same kind of reason as I would consider another M-A/MP/M3, etc (so, I'm with you Jeff S too). Just like the M10D each of these bodies delivers slightly different strengths and weaknesses, we become attuned to them, and work creatively to deliver through them. It's part of the appeal, especially as other (immensely capable) systems deliver so much 'more' so much more easily. (I think everyone here gets this, right?). Thank you chasdfg, petermullett, LocalHero1953, LBJ2, and Jeff S for your comments too, and thank you LocalHero1953 for the welcome back too. LBJ2, regarding the shortlist, it's been tough working on this. I don't want to go nuts in the way I have in the past. I've been fortnate enough to own or try most at some point or other, or for longer periods. I want to get what I will really use, as opposed to fondle. \ud83d\ude01 The change in eyesight is also something I have to get used to. I've gone in to a couple of boutiques to try to figure out what feels comfortable. I don't want to set myself up for frustration. I do like the 28mm fl, but with eyeglasses in between me and the OVF (something that will be new to me), I worry that to much of the periphery of the view will be obscured by the limited access the glasses -----> create !!! . I'm someone who likes to do a quick scan around the framelines during photo-taking to check composition. I don't like to over-crop later in post. Or, at least, I try to challenge myself that way, and worry that this new dimension to the challenge will be de-motivating. I have found in the past that I feel very natural composing in 35mm, so that, and I think 50mm would make a good two lens starting point. I'm still debating 50APO and 50LX.

I'd forgotten (forgive me!) how much I enjoyed chatting with other photography nuts here on this forum. \ud83d\ude42 chasdfg - so much of your experience seems familiar to me! Regarding the M10D, I really smiled when I saw that one. I can't claim to have been part of the clamour here from those who imagined this camera, but I was one of those persuaded by it. I bought, and reported on the M60 - kind of the beta release for this, and I also had and reported here on the M-D (typ262). The same concept in M10 form has appeal I really get. But I also learned - especially with the M-D, the sometimes I like to frame and shoot, slightly arms length from the rear screen, and it is useful to have that option. But... I get it. The M246 I never really gelled with, and in fact while I owned that one I \"downgraded\" to the MM, which really made the MM's antiquated feel stand out, not to mention that \"guh jjjjjjrrrrrrrr\" after the shutter release. But there is - to this day - something about the MM files, and when I happen upon them in my catalogue they really stand out. I can imagine, in a return to the M, even if I had an M10M, I would still consider an MM, just as much and for the same kind of reason as I would consider another M-A/MP/M3, etc (so, I'm with you Jeff S too). Just like the M10D each of these bodies delivers slightly different strengths and weaknesses, we become attuned to them, and work creatively to deliver through them. It's part of the appeal, especially as other (immensely capable) systems deliver so much 'more' so much more easily. (I think everyone here gets this, right?). Thank you chasdfg, petermullett, LocalHero1953, LBJ2, and Jeff S for your comments too, and thank you LocalHero1953 for the welcome back too. LBJ2, regarding the shortlist, it's been tough working on this. I don't want to go nuts in the way I have in the past. I've been fortnate enough to own or try most at some point or other, or for longer periods. I want to get what I will really use, as opposed to fondle. \ud83d\ude01 The change in eyesight is also something I have to get used to. I've gone in to a couple of boutiques to try to figure out what feels comfortable. I don't want to set myself up for frustration. I do like the 28mm fl, but with eyeglasses in between me and the OVF (something that will be new to me), I worry that to much of the periphery of the view will be obscured by the limited access the glasses -----> create !!! . I'm someone who likes to do a quick scan around the framelines during photo-taking to check composition. I don't like to over-crop later in post. Or, at least, I try to challenge myself that way, and worry that this new dimension to the challenge will be de-motivating. I have found in the past that I feel very natural composing in 35mm, so that, and I think 50mm would make a good two lens starting point. I'm still debating 50APO and 50LX. Before I think it would have been no hesitating for the 50APO. I owned that lens for 6 years and know its immense capabilities. But right now for this system I also feel a little tempted back to the more painterly qualities of the near-focus range open aperture range of the 50LX ASPH - which, as we know, is no slouch either. But, I'm still working on this... You have the benefit of many years experience with old and new Leica and what appears to me, a very open mind...I like and value that on a Leica forum. I only know the M10 OVF and I've always been near-sighted. The M10 and my glasses seem very natural to me which is great since I can't RF accurately without it and my eye lash smudge the Leica diopter so I can't RF with a diopter either. Not sure if the M10's slightly increased eye relief has anything to do with it or it's simply all I know ha ha. My lens path started with the 35 Lux FLE and 50 Lux APSH specifically for the f1,4 and later selected the large Noctilux 50 f0,95 for special occasions. My motto has always been buy as much light as I can, even if the 50 APO is stunning at F2 and latest-greatest APO technology is my typical inclination. One day I'll try the 50APO, but don't want to give up f1,4. Even with digital, I find f1,4 logistics very much needed for low light where I have to really push ISO to keep handhold-ability. Either way, best wishes and much fun on your Leica M rebuild journey and I look forward to reading about your finds and adventure.

Just want to add points on the M10D and M10M compared to their predecessor(s). On the M10D, aside from the slimmer body, it has that really nifty thumb rest. I wasn't sold by this at first. Ergonomically, even without the thumb rest the M10D feels better in hand than the M10M because the back of the camera has no clutter and no LCD in the way. When I tried the M10D at different Leica stores I didn't much of the thumb rest and thought I would only use it for the sake of it. I was very wrong though, and it's something that grew on me quickly. Another thing is wifi, which is quite handy when commuting and I want see some pics I've taken or to use the remote function with live view via the Fotos app (not that I use wifi much, but it's there)...though the wifi aspect can be very divisive for purists. Also, the M10D looks so bloody good and is the most beautiful production digital M I've seen. This said, my feel about the M10D is that unless one is absolutely averse to the idea of processing film, buying a film camera and shooting film would get you there too, so it's not really as much of a game-changer in that respect. Plus it really depends on one's view of the \"inconvenience\" of -----> developing !!!  film - if one enjoys the process, then it's not much of a con (I for one am too lazy and would probably hoard dozens of rolls before doing anything about them). My only bugbear about buying a Leica film camera now is that prices for popular cameras have gone through the roof (and too the moon, and past that) in the past couple of years. On the M10M, I completely understand the appeal of the M9M and how unique those files are. I tend to view the M10M a little differently, in that the camera is it's own camera, not just lumped into the family of \"Monochroms\" and having the title of being the latest one on the market. It isn't an M9M and won't be. It has different film loaded into its DNA and will produce different files (out of the camera, the files are too punchy for my liking, so much so i changed the LCD picture review to have lower contrast too). Alfonso Cuaron mentioned that when he was producing the movie Roma, he wanted that movie to be in black and white, but didn't want it to be a black and white movie with the film grain and rawness reflecting the 1970s it was set in. He took a different approach and wanted the black and white aspect to convey nostalgia yet shoot \"clean\" black and white, utilising the strength of modern sensors today (with Arri cameras) and exploiting the depth and capabilities of this modern medium. I hope I didn't butcher or mis-convey what he was saying. Anyhow, I realised that that is how the M10M sensor should be seen - a modern medium to shoot black and white. Not Tri-X, or Ilford Delta, or even M9M. You can emulate those in post to some degree, but the M10M can also be its own camera and should be seen as it's own camera. It's tough even within the trio of Monochroms due to the M9M's cult following. Just my thoughts! Of course the above is moot if you just want to go simple and just get an M10P or M10R. Either one of them can do everything the M10M and M10D can as long as you have the self-imposed limitations, plus the M10R can do high res too. Lens wise, I feel the same as you about the 50APO in that I never found the f2 lacking in giving me \"thin DOF\". I would always say the 50lux ASPH is the ideal 50mm M to get because it does everything great (not just doing everything \"good enough\" but great) with speed, sharpness, size, MFD all thrown into one. I don't think any general photographer should find the sharpness and capability lacking in all modern Karbe lenses and they are all reliable performers image quality wise. More so if you don't go out testing lenses to no end and worrying about wavy plane of focus or that pinch more distortion than the 50APO, which to me are imperceptible and almost never in-your-face. One thing I've determined after my tedious and tiresome journey to deciding my current kit is that honestly, the only rational thing one should do is ensure you can afford what you're looking at. After that, the heart takes over and you should just get what you want. Too much of my time was wasted counting pennies and depreciation over 5 years, not wanting to put so much money in a spare camera, feeling guilty about owning X camera or Y lens, being practical or \"too economical\"...and this took a lot of joy out of the hobby. Ultimately, if you do get your lenses used, the cost of ownership per month is almost nothing if they are kept in good condition (plenty of places in HK to shop used too. I am envious!) and the cost of ownership for each of those cameras per month probably the same as how much you'd spend on film (or a nice meal or some alcohol...you get me).

I now use Nikon's for work with my Leica. Somewhere in this forum others have talked about the idea that there is a perfect fit for some people when it comes to your favorite camera. For street photography the M-9 was the best thing that ever happened to me. Followed by a 240MP, for a short time. In March of this year I decided the SL2 was what I needed--can't remember exactly why now. It is a nice camera, but until I actually walked the streets (Washington, DC) I didn't realize why I am a Leica M person. The slightly heavier SL2 was too heavy. The electronics were diversions to me. The bulk wasn't subtle, especially with an SL lens (I tried to get back to normal with my Summilux--helped a little). A lot of things on the camera I don't use or need. So, at a loss, I sold the barely used SL2 to B&H for about half price in September. Maybe 500 images. Not many, but enough to conclude that this wasn't my camera. I then bought the Leica M-10R and it is absolutely heaven for what I do with a camera. So after all these years I have come to the same conclusion as some others - it isn't a question of the best camera. Not even the best camera for a particular type of use or work.

Any adjustment has some tolerance, and it's quite possible that with their old methods a body RF calibration could be towards one end of tolerance, and a lens calibration at the opposite end of tolerance. Thus while both met \"factory specs\" the combination - especially with a digital sensor and a lens like the 0.95 Noctilux with almost no DOF - might not be optimal. So sending both would let a technician see if the \"match\" required finer adjustment. I understand Leica -----> developed !!!  expensive new equipment and methods to make both calibrations more accurate (and likely less dependent on the individual technician's skill), so checking both together is not now recommended. However, there's still a chance that if only one is re-calibrated the other might not meet the new, tighter adjustment spec either. That said, in my 50+ years of owning & using Leica M cameras and lenses I've only had one body (M9) drift out of RF calibration (once). I have had a an issue with RF mis-calibration when a camera had a full service (CLA) by a (non factory) Leica tech - but that was obvious when I received the camera back, as both vertical and horizontal RF alignment was off a bit. On a retry it came back the same with the tech insisting it met factory specs - so I instead sent it to DAG who got it perfect. However, I should admit I've avoided fast exotic glass with no DOF, so my use may not be as critical as some. I had one lens lose calibration when dropped and an element shifted (also causing other optical effects), and a few lenses that were mal-adjusted from the factory, but otherwise no lenses drift out of RF cal. Overall I've had more issues with SLR camera focus issues (mirror & screen changes) that with Leica RF cameras. Live View - direct image from sensor - has much less opportunity for focus errors, if the EVF gives good evaluation of sharpness - but I still find electronic \"in-focus\" signals to be less precise than needed."}, {"autor": "petermullett", "posts": "837 posts", "date": "12/13/2020 08:56  AM", "content": "3 hours ago, chasdfg said: I also have a mini rant about how the Fotos App menu settings for configuring the M10D are so brief it's infuriating. I wish there were options such as dust detection and sensor cleaning (how does one clean the sensor safely with this thing?), file naming (do I have to do this in the computer?) as well as copyright info settings all built into the Fotos App. Basically I just wish they could mirror all the M10/P/Mono settings in Fotos. Why cripple the camera this much if you're already allowing users to adjust settings via WiFi? Its a halfway implementation which would neither satisfy \"purists\" nor people who expect proper menu access if you're providing this function. I have a M10-D myself, and I have to say that despite real irritations it is a \"favourite\" M of those that I presently own..............BUT at the same time I've labelled it in other posts the \"Orphan\" M because Leica put it out then totally ignored it as far as any meaningful or useful enhancement of it's capability. I agree that it's annoying, stupid even, that there's no sensor cleaning function...how the hell do we do that? I've disliked the fact that if you mount the Visoflex 020 the GPS is turned on automatically whether you need it or not with no way of turning it off thus being an unnecessary battery drain. Why is there no way to access the camera menu via the 020,?

There's a \"Feedback\" option in Foto's whereby you can let Leica know your thoughts on the camera use that for your complaints or suggestions I have a few times although I've yet to receive an answer,......Maybe more \"squeaky wheels\" will get their attention.

It does what it should - give me the proper experience of a screenless M (no cases with LCD covers or just turning off auto-review, the \"proper\" experience) and getting me close to the experience of shooting film without the -----> developing !!!  process and time (which I admit is also part of the process of film). I only raised these issues and went into a rant because these are so glaring when one sets up the camera and in my initial period of use. I didn't realise it before, but as @petermullett mentioned, the M7 has the switch where the film advance lever is at. Leica has a reference point from the cameras they made before, which almost makes it worse. It is just unusual to have to turn to the back of the M to turn the camera on but this is not a major complaint because I used to shoot the SL and it has the on/off switch on the other end of the camera. It's something i'd get used to and either way will probably leave the camera turned on with auto power off at 2mins to leave it on standby most of the time, as this appears to work for a couple of M10D users. I suppose this on/off switch at the lever may be addressed in an M11D, though this is probably at least 2 years away and am not going to cry about the switch placement. This isn't a deal breaker by any stretch. On the Fotos app, it's striking on set up because I normally wish to set the camera up properly when I first get it. Can't rename files, can't set copyright info (though I can in Lightroom). And I do like the dust detection system and sensor cleaning option found in the M240/M10 menus (there are workarounds, so no major issues here too). I know workarounds are commonplace in the Leica world. When a camera freezes, we pull the batt out. However, it would have been nice to seamlessly transition between cameras if one is already setting the camera up via Fotos. If not, it'd rather the MD-262 approach, which is not to give us this option at all. That's fine. On a somewhat related note regarding the EVF, I don't generally use the EVF as my main lenses are M lenses between 28mm to 50mm. It's not meant to work perpetually with an EVF and I agree an M10 with EVF or the SL might be a better option if one has to do a lot of work with an EVF. This said, I did use it with an R lens over the weekend and aside adapting glass and shooting wideangles, I also think it might be quite useful to check focus easily as I know I have no rear LCD to fall back on (this being the case when I do shoots or more critical situations). Offering the EVF capability but not having a LV button to switch it on and off or to turn off GPS is something I didn't think Leica would overlook. These might also have been non-issues if a full M10 menu was provided for the camera, at least for the GPS anyway. Annoyingly, the workarounds for these would be to not use the camera with the EVF (this is my only colour camera and I don't wish to purchase another camera just to do critical shoots, which are few and far between anyway), to turn the camera off in-between shots (the 2 minute auto-power off would still drain the battery significantly with the EVF and GPS perpetually turned on), to buy a truckload of batteries...All not very feasible or unnecessarily impractical. My point is, you don't offer EVF capability and implement it so poorly. I don't like an all or nothing approach but I think it might have worked better for this camera. You either give us the capability properly implemented or you don't at all. The points I raised above all are due to Leica giving me a taste of what the camera can do and then leaving much to be desired (at least initially anyway). What happened to the production and software design team? I am certain all these points were raised to them before by testers but never worked on. It's probably excuses, like the M10D's Fotos menu is the same as the M10's in Fotos so it's standard etc. It's like seeing someone standing 1 metre from the finish line of a race and just standing there. Okay, that's the last of my rant. I do love this camera, I really do. It's got me more excited to shoot than my M10M ever did and I do enjoy staring at a good-looking camera. I will sell my only R lens and I don't have any lenses wider than 28mm. So the EVF will go too, as will my frustrations about EVF use...swept under the carpet. Will sweep my Fotos frustrations under that carpet too. Edited December 16, 2020 by chasdfg"}], "name": "PersonalPronoun"}
