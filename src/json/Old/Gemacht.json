Thoughts? Thanks -Brad Avoid the 35mm Summicron-M (11673) if you can, unless you really like flare. Even then, avoid it, because it's not worth the $4,000. Earlier this year I was looking to get my very first 35mm lens because 28mm felt too wide, but I couldn't decide which Leica lens to get. I wasn't even sure if I would find the 35 focal length appealing, so I decided to try the Voigtlander Color-Skopar 35mm f/2.5 before spending too much money. Funny enough, I did end up enjoying the Voigtlander, mainly because of its small size and decent quality. There are some aberrations if you know what to look for, but overall it's decent, specially at that price point. So, I decided I liked the 35mm focal length enough to buy a brand new 35mm Summicron-M (11673). By this point, I had the 28mm Summicron (11672), which is an absolutely awesome lens (which at the time I didn't know and ended up selling it, and yes I do regret it \ud83d\ude14). In my mind, the 35mm Summicron-M (11673) was going to be a similar lens in quality as the 28mm Summicron (11672) except the longer focal length, but boy was I wrong. One of the first things I noticed immediately with the 35mm Summicron (11673) was the flaring. I shoot a lot of high-contrast night scenes, and it always produced flares. Even the smallest source of light in the frame would produce flare. And the flare was the really ugly kind, the UFO looking flare that's really distracting. With the Skopar I never got flares, except when shooting directly at the sun, and If there was flare, it was barely noticeable. I contacted the dealer and asked him TWICE and very directly about the flare issue, and in both cases he dodged the question (in fact he just ignored them, which was a bit weird TBH). So I decided to contact Leica USA. After analyzing my DNG files, their camera and lens experts told me that they had never seen such flaring with the 35mm Summicron-M (11673), but they also recommended that I contact Leica Germany, which I did. Leica Germany told me that the flare is not unusual with the 35mm Summicron-M, and that I do not have a bad copy. To me that kind of flaring is an unacceptable flaw, specially for a $4,000 lens, so I decided to return it. As it turns out, the 28mm Summicron-M (11672) is a very modern lens (2015, IIRC), whereas the 35mm Summicron-M (11673) is some twenty years old. You mentioned that this is going to be your first lens, and since you're open to a 50mm, I would highly recommend 50mm Summilux-M.

Image sensors all only have one \"real\" ISO, called the base ISO. Which -----> creates !!!  the optimal and most efficient sensor output - one photon in knocks loose one electron to be captured and counted, with no overflow. For the M10 24Mpixel color sensor, this is about \"ISO 135-ish\" according to Leica. An analogy would be - put a needle on a rotating vinyl/wax sound recording, and the needle will vibrate and put out a given amount of sound all by itself. That is its \"base volume.\" The original \"phonographs\" amplified the sound with a megaphone or trumpet - eventually electrical devices were used to amplify the vibrations (or \"signal\") instead. --img--  All the other ISOs a digital camera may offer come from processing the base ISO image with additional processing chips. Amplifying or \"pushing\" it to a higher ISO get a usable image using less light, or to a lesser extent subduing it with de-amplification (\"pulling\") to get a lower apparent ISO, a stronger signal and thus slightly less noise (better signal/noise ratio). I guess those could be called \"virtual ISOs.\" But I've never head that term used. The ability to \"pull\" a digital image is very limited, since the base ISO is already using the full capacity of the sensor's \"pixel wells\" that store the electrons, and adding more light very quickly overflows the capacity of the wells to distinguish bright things, leading to \"blown\" highlights without detail. On the basic M10, ISO 100 is a slight \"pull\" of the base ISO, and ISO 200 or higher are \"pushes\" of the base ISO (weaker and weaker native signals (sensor exposed to less light than optimal), amplified more and more, and thus acquiring more and more noise.) And for whatever reason (probably to maintain even steps: 100, 200, 400, etc., on the mechanical ISO knob), Leica does not allow accessing and using the actual base ISO. ................... As to digital ISO compared to film ISO, the ISO (International Organization for Standards) standards for measuring each are completely different. Film ISOs are determined by measuring shadow density (although Ilford, for example, doesn't use the ISO method, for their own films). Digital ISOs are measured differently based on signal, noise, midtones - and only for .jpgs, since each photographer will do their own processing with raw of .DNG files). Nevertheless, in practical use, they are generally close, so that an external independent light meter, which has no idea what camera one is using, should produce equally-bright pictures from the same light, subject, and manual camera settings. The only way to really test that is a direct comparison with a color slide film of ISO 100 (no printing corrections allowed) and a digital .jpg taken at the same aperture and shutter speed at ISO 100 (no photographer post-processing - \"straight from the camera\"). The ISO organization doesn't come close to doing such a test, and I suspect most camera makers don't bother, either. DxO claims their testing system comes close, but it's still based on a \"virtual\" mathematical model, not shooting Velvia 100 alongside an M10 or the other cameras they test.

The material the field bag is made of is water resistant but not 100% water proof.

After numerous random front focus shots with CV 40mm F1.2 on M10 I decided to put camera on a tripod and investigate what is wrong: There is a consistent front focus when focusing from infinity toward 2m. Rangefinder split image always matches when focus scale is at about 2.9m When focusing from 2m toward infinity, split image always matches at exactly 3m focus scale, and then target is consistently in focus (because distance to target is 3m). So at least I can focus precisely at F1.2 when rotating ring toward infinity. But what I'm observing in the rangefinder doesn't look right: Focusing toward infinity - patch frame is smoothly moving up-left and split image changes. When switch focus direction and very slowly rotating focus ring, patch frame first \"jumps\" a bit up-left (and split image remains still during that), then patch frame is moving smoothly down-right and split image also changes. When switch focus direction toward infinity, patch frame first moves a little down-right and split image remains unchanged, then patch frame starts moving up-left and split image changes. I don't know how the rangefinder mechanics is -----> built !!!  in inside, but it feels like there is some mechanical play that is causing such influencing patch movement lag, and resulting to serious front focus error when focusing toward closer distance.

The camera housing has a particularly scratch-resistant dark green finish and is covered with Kevlar fabric - the synthetic fiber that is also used to produce ballistic protective clothing. The M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is available at specialist retailers and only 450 units will be available worldwide. Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d: A homage to the great reportage photographers of our time Wetzlar, January 21, 2021. As part of the celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the Leica Oskar Barnack Award, Leica Camera AG presents a special design variant of the Leica M10-P: the M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is an uncompromising reportage camera, suitable for even the most challenging conditions. Many Leica cameras throughout the company\u2019s history have been developed with the needs of press and reportage photographers in mind. This is illustrated by exceptional models such as the Leica 250 of 1933, whose film cassette accommodated 250 exposures, or the Leica MP of 1956 \u2013 a Leica M3 variant which was equipped with the Leicavit rapid winder, following the suggestions of renowned photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt (1898\u2013 1995) and David Douglas Duncan (1916\u20132018). With its dark green, particularly scratch-resistant finish and Kevlar camera trim, the Leica M10- P \u201cReporter\u201d brings to mind the extremely challenging conditions under which many of the most remarkable reportages of our time were -----> created !!! . Kevlar is a synthetic fibre frequently used in the production of ballistic protective clothing. Through exposure to natural UV rays, the camera\u2019s body armour will gradually turn the same colour as its top and base plate. The armour\u2019s diamond-weave texture makes the Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d especially grippy and comfortable to hold. All of the camera\u2019s engravings are inlaid in light green, resulting in a more discreet effect than the white inlays customarily used on black-finish cameras. In terms of its technical specifications, the M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is identical to the serially produced Leica M10- P. The Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d is available at specialist retailers. A total of 450 units of the Leica M10-P \u201cReporter\u201d will be available worldwide. --img-- "}, {"autor": "seekwul", "posts": "61 posts", "date": "12/05/2020 08:22  PM", "content": "Advertisement (gone after registration) Hi What is the difference between Leica 14409 (Leica Macro Adapter M for 90mm f/4 Macro Lens) and Leica 14652 (Leica Macro-Adapter-M) ?

The 14652 is the newer model which can be adjusted via helicoil whereas the other is (I believe) fixed. The other difference is of course the integration of the eyes, as you mentioned. With the helicoid fully retracted you may use the 90/4 retracted and it will work as if extended to working position - however you will of course lose the rangefinder coupling...

However, money is not unlimited, so I still have some choices to make, which I'm hoping some of you can help with, or at least confirm that they might not be as tough as they appear. My current thinking is that I can get a good used M10 (\u00a34100) and 35mm Summilux ASPH II (\u00a32300). I'm mostly going to be using this for travel and street style, so I think that this seems like a good combination. Photography isn't my profession, or even a money-making sideline, it's just for my own enjoyment. And yes, I fully realise that there are many cheaper, newer, 'better' cameras out there. I don't want one of those. But then, the internet hinders as much as it helps. Should I spend another \u00a31000 for the M10-P? The touch screen looks nice but isn't a big issue for me, and the quieter shutter is, well, nice? I don't see hundreds of threads of people complaining about the outrageously loud shutter on the M10, so is it really worth it for me? And it will take me another few months to save the extra cash. Then there's the M10-R, obviously, but at least another \u00a33000 on top of my M10 budget. And an even longer time to save. Ideally I could add in some actual real world experiences to my decision making. However here in the UK it doesn't seem possible to hire any of these cameras so I can't try them out to see which I prefer, and I don't know anyone with one either. I find it very easy to get caught up in the details, just because there's something newer, 'better', whatever. So maybe my question is this; is the M10 still a good value introduction to the Leica world? Thoughts, ideas, and help all appreciated. Yes I think so. Anyway, for me the gateway to Leica World in the nineties has been secondhand gear and it has been for a long time after. I then even preferred an M4 above a new M6. In your case however I personally would definitely choose for the M10-P. The silence of its shutter is such a joy in actual shooting, which would be my main reason. But in theatre photography, which I like, it is an important functionality too. The -----> built !!! -in level gauge would help me making good vertical shots and with a 35mm, or wider later on, this is an important aid. As I get older I see that I make much more often tilted shots. The touchscreen is faster in checking focus. Your argument for the choice for the Summilux 35mm asph ii is bull\u2019s eye in my view.

Lighting and composition just become that much more important in the absence of color to offset any deficiencies in image content, and therein lies the value; it imposes a somewhat forced mental discipline to strip down a scene to its bare essentials, and I think this really challenges our creative side. I find myself fancying this once again, rather than \"after the fact\" as it were when recording a color image. The effectively higher resolution of the M10M is a nice bonus, but its really the constraint imposed by imaging with B&W only that I want to experience once again. Based on prints from the M10-R and my SL2, I suspect the M10M might well represent an entirely new level of image quality, that may even come close to those drum scans of days gone by, at least for the 17x22/16x24 sizes that I enjoy printing at.

The coding, whether manual or -----> built !!! -in at the Leica factory, will affect both jpegs and raw files more or less equally. It affects the camera programming enroute between the sensor and the final file on the SD card. 2. The coding only automatically corrects, in the camera, for color vignetting and normal brightness vignetting (to a variable extent).* In addition, the fact that the lens type is then also recorded in a picture's EXIF metadata means that, after the fact, depending on what post-processing software one uses, the post-processing software (not the camera) may apply corrections for distortion and some regular vignetting. I have coded lenses, I use Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Camera Raw. They do absolutely nothing to fix distortion or vignetting just because the lens is coded. Those still have to be manually corrected with sliders, coding or not. Other software may vary, and may have an \"on/off\" switch to automatically detect the lens type and apply corrections, or not - see post-processing software instructions 3. This site has a list of the 6-bit codes - not sure how up-to-date: https://lavidaleica.com/content/leica-lens-codes The L-Camera Forum used to, but right now our link is reading \"404.\" I've reported it - the mods may repair it. See top of the M Lenses subforum for the thread with the link. 4. Lightroom (or other) profiles will do zip/nada/nothing to fix the color vignetting problem, when it exists. It has to be done in-camera at the moment of exposure for decent (and fast, automatic, seamless) results. I think Lightroom now has a \"flat-field\" plug-in that can help - but it stills requires some user intervention. Not as seamless as getting it fixed at the moment of exposure, all the time, every picture. Only 1) coding the lens, or 2) using the camera's lens menu to identify the lens type in use, will fix the color vignetting automatically and easily. ___________________ *The deal is this. Digital sensors do not play nicely with old-fashioned, rangefinder-type, close-to-the-sensor, wide-angle lenses (35mm or wider). This produces both brightness vignetting (closer and closer to the picture corners, not all the light gets to the silicon), and color vignetting (the light sometimes leaks from a red- or blue-filtered pixel onto a green-sensitive pixel (or vice-versa), and gets recorded as the wrong color). Lenses longer than 50mm usually do not show any vignetting problems if uncoded - they sit far enough away from the image plane/sensor. In the second case, this causes a measurable stain of magenta or blue-green along the short \"sides\" of the image and in the corners. A.K.A. \"Italian Flag syndrome.\" See photograph below. See diagram of older sensors (left), and the newer Leica CMOS sensors with different construction at the pixel level, which correct things partially. But not for all wide lenses - I can still see obvious problems with 35 and 28 images even on the M10 with the improved sensor, if the lenses are not coded, or ID'd via the lens menu. --img--  The Leica M color cameras have corrections -----> built !!!  into their firmware to dial out both types of vignetting, if the camera \"knows\" exactly which lens was used. It adds or subtracts color from parts of the image right-now after exposure, while the image data is being processed in-camera enroute to the SD card. This shows what color vignetting looks like - pink stain on the left, cyan on the right (like an Italian flag: 1980 Leica 21mm Elmarit, with \"poor\" correction from early M9 firmware, 2010). --img--  Lenses' vignetting patterns are like fingerprints - they depend on the precise path the light takes passing through the particular shapes of glass in the optical layout.

That's in single unit quantity, and about 15% of the retail price of Leica's official product. The battery chemistry is probably comparable. Lithium Ion batteries have been around a long time and there's not that much magic. So if you could source the correctly sized cells (two lithium ion cells in series to produce 7.4V), you could theoretically -----> build !!!  a BP-SCL5 replacement. In addition to the storage cells, there's also a bit of electronics inside the battery to 1) make sure it doesn't get too hot, 2) prevent a dead short from happening, 3) prevent the battery from being discharged too much, 4) to communicate with the camera and/or charger. #1, 2#, and #3 are commodities and probably cost a few cents (USD) in Asia. #4 is \"special sauce\" that might it harder to copy the design. Along with #4 is the mechanical design of the battery enclosure and contacts. It's just plastic, but fit and finish are important and any aftermarket design would need tight enough tolerances. I used aftermarket batteries in my M8 for years and they mostly worked fine. However, they didn't charge reliably on the Leica charger and I think the cell voltage was not the same as the OEM batteries. The clone manufacturer probably had access to cells with a slightly different (and cheaper) voltage/chemistry and just used that. The aftermarket M8 batteries tended to puff up over the years to the point where they wouldn't slide in and out of the camera any more. They weren't perfect, but at 1/5th the cost of Leica batteries, they were a good value. I suspect that there are (or will be) enough M10s in the world that the aftermarket battery people will get involved eventually.

In the case of images recorded in DNG format, the raw data is stored unchanged while the corrections calculated by Perspective Control are written to the metadata. They are then applied automatically in Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop, or can optionally be discarded. For JPEG format images the correction occurs directly in the camera, and only the corrected image is stored. In comparison to the manual distortion correction that is available as an alternative, Leica Perspective Control offers several advantages. Due to its automated nature, it is faster than the manual process. The ability to bring up an auxiliary frame of the corrected image prior to recording, as well as view corrected JPEG images immediately after they were captured, makes it significantly easier to determine the correct framing and most suitable lens. In addition, given that the corrections are based on the data collected by the camera\u2019s orientation sensors (as opposed to the visible details of the captured image) it is also possible to rectify images that do not contain any straight lines. To begin with, the new Leica Perspective Control function will be available for the camera models Leica M10-P, M10-R and M10 Monochrom. The firmware update containing this new feature can be downloaded free of charge at www.leica-camera.com, and installed by following the instructions provided."}, {"autor": "sebben", "posts": "169 posts", "date": "02/28/2021 04:34  PM", "content": "Why not?

The Zeiss optically is as good as it gets in any 35mm f1.4 lens. Compared to the Summilux it has a smoother bokeh, a flat (not wavy) plane of focus and better flare control. Wide-open it is sharper than the Summilux, particularly away from the image centre. I switched completely from Canon to Leica because of this lens, which comfortably out performed the Sigma 35mm Art that I was using previously. But I eventually sold the Zeiss for a Summilux. The finder blockage was occasionally a problem, and I need to carry two sets of filters (all my other lenses used a 46mm thread).The Zeiss is also slower to focus with a much stiffer focus ring, which can be an issue if trying to focus rapidly (for example, in quick street photography). My advice would be to opt for the Zeiss if working more slowly and where every last drop of image quality matters (eg, landscape, travel), or opt for the Leica if your priority is small size and quick focussing (eg street, documentary).

My motto has always been buy as much light as I can, even if the 50 APO is stunning at F2 and latest-greatest APO technology is my typical inclination. One day I'll try the 50APO, but don't want to give up f1,4. Even with digital, I find f1,4 logistics very much needed for low light where I have to really push ISO to keep handhold-ability.

If not, you need to use your glasses, contact lenses or you need to purchase a diopter correction lens for the viewfinder. Or whatever else you need to be able to see clearly at a distance of several meters. If this is ok, there is of course the possibility that there is someting wrong with your rangefinder or that rangefinder vertical alignment is off. In the latter case you will be able to focus correctly using vertical lines, but the overall contrast of the rangefinder will not increase on correct focus as much as it should, because the images don't coincide vertically. You should be able to see if this is the case when there are horizontal lines inside the patch. You should also make sure that your eye is centered in the viewfinder eyepiece. The rangefinder patch doesn't work correctly if viewed at an angle. And then it's also good to remember that the rangefinder patch is only illuminated by the light coming in from the subject, so it may be very dim in low light. The Viso 020 works in the same way as live view on the lcd without any extra setup. However, the default setting that activates the focus aid (enlarging function) when turning the focusing ring may not be the best setting for everyone. I have changed it so that it activates only when pressing the front button. Unlike the optical viewfinder, the Viso has -----> built !!! -in, adjustable dioptre correction.

I previously used the SL system but my clients didn't like the rendering. Everyone has different ideas and opinions on that subject and will leave that alone. Yes, the SL and M lenses do work in a most excellent manner as you will read in a number of threads in the forum. My experience though, demonstrated the M lenses work best on M cameras and are designed to do so. The SL works best with SL lenses. I found the larger M lenses like the Noctilux and others were easier to focus at times with the SL, but performance was best with M cameras. It will get down to your preference of handling and rendering by the sensor. Everyone on the forum will offer different and well intentioned opinions. My 2 cents...if you are upgrading a M240...get a M10-R. Then get out and -----> create !!!  superb photographs with your 35 Summilux.

When using live view remotely or using the EVF, the top of the readout seems to have a thin translucent bar over the entire readout frame/image. This bar does not appear in the photos taken by the camera, both in live view/evf and using the RF - it only appears when live view is used and that's it. Has anyone experienced this before? It's definitely not the EVF as it works fine on my M10Mono. It's not a big deal, I don't intend to use the EVF or live view much anyway, but just concerned it might be an issue. I also have a mini rant about how the Fotos App menu settings for configuring the M10D are so brief it's infuriating. I wish there were options such as dust detection and sensor cleaning (how does one clean the sensor safely with this thing?), file naming (do I have to do this in the computer?) as well as copyright info settings all -----> built !!!  into the Fotos App. Basically I just wish they could mirror all the M10/P/Mono settings in Fotos. Why cripple the camera this much if you're already allowing users to adjust settings via WiFi? Its a halfway implementation which would neither satisfy \"purists\" nor people who expect proper menu access if you're providing this function. Anyway, pics of the translucent bar (screenshots via the Fotos App on my phone) are as below. Note the top 3-5% of the image displayed has a faint bar (I noticed it first on the EVF). Apologies in advance for the poor quality on the screenshots. Might be better to view them in the lightbox but I understand they're not easy to see.

Its a halfway implementation which would neither satisfy \"purists\" nor people who expect proper menu access if you're providing this function. I have a M10-D myself, and I have to say that despite real irritations it is a \"favourite\" M of those that I presently own..............BUT at the same time I've labelled it in other posts the \"Orphan\" M because Leica put it out then totally ignored it as far as any meaningful or useful enhancement of it's capability. I agree that it's annoying, stupid even, that there's no sensor cleaning function...how the hell do we do that? I've disliked the fact that if you mount the Visoflex 020 the GPS is turned on automatically whether you need it or not with no way of turning it off thus being an unnecessary battery drain. Why is there no way to access the camera menu via the 020,? I hate being reliant on Foto's and carrying a 'phone to make settings adjustments, that seems contrary to the whole philosophy of the camera, it should be able to be self contained and independent and not over reliant on Foto's at all. Foto's itself I have always found for me to be finicky and next to useless anyway. Yes I too could rant more. There's a \"Feedback\" option in Foto's whereby you can let Leica know your thoughts on the camera use that for your complaints or suggestions I have a few times although I've yet to receive an answer,......Maybe more \"squeaky wheels\" will get their attention. The camera is, like the Monochroms, a wonderful addition to Leica M's line of cameras, but they made it a three legged horse at best. Surely there was or still could be much more Leica could improve regarding the camera's functions and capabilities and as you say. at least give it more of the software / menu features that the rest of the M10's line enjoy. It is after all an M10 with the absence of the LCD, but I don't think that is ever going to happen and that's a pity because despite real frustrations the concept and much of the execution of the camera is so damn good."}, {"autor": "LBJ2", "posts": "640 posts", "date": "12/13/2020 11:10  AM", "content": "6 hours ago, chasdfg said: Hi all, I picked up an M10-D yesterday and I noticed something odd.
