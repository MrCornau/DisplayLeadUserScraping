When you focus on a point straight in front of you & take a photo: The image plane in focus is a plane that is a straight line that is like the horizontal top of the letter \"T\". Also: Think of the line that is the part from the top of the \"T\" to the bottom as being the line from you to the subject. When you focus on something which is a distance horizontally away (Left or Right.) from this line to the top of the \"T\" then you are actually focusing on the circumference of a circle with a radius that is the length from you to the top of the \"T\". A circle where the edge of the circle only touches the edge of the straight ahead, same radius, image plane where that circle touches that plane straight ahead. So if you stood there & rotated a few degrees at a time & took photos: Each photo would have the CENTER in focus at that distance. Because lenses for cameras like the 1's we use are -----> DESIGNED !!!  to produce a flat image plane at a right angle from a line from the camera/lens to the point of focus: When a person focuses off center with a wide angle lens the ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT can become quite large so that: When a person turns the camera/lens back to compose: The distance that had originally been focused on has become a small portion of the new distance to where the image plane has moved to. I do not have the technical equipment to put a diagram on the screen. The further the angle of the subject focused on is: From the line going thru the center of the composition: The further away from the plane of focus the subject originally focused on will be. Because the actual plane of focus will EFFECTIVELY move further & further away from the subject originally focused on the FURTHER away from the center of the line of composition that the original subject is. The plane of focus of the original subject will EFFECTIVELY move CLOSER to the camera.

The M10-P was a Wetzlar upgrade from the regular M10, that for me was a good move and I like to recycle stuff it at all possible rather than trade in / up. 24 megapixels are enough for me as I easily get A2 size -----> print !!! s from the files, sometimes even larger when I farm out that -----> print !!!  work. I was given a trial of the M10-R about a year or so ago and I saw no real advantages for me in it's sensor and one disadvantage, the well discussed here motion problem that necessitates use of higher shutter speed to counter. The M10-M is a wonderful beast, no need to elaborate on that fact, and I love the M10-D as one adores, despite the problems it brings to ownership, the adopted dog that isn't quite housetrained and keeps running away to it's original home. I see little reason to upgrade from what I have in digital M's, I don't need more megapixels, I'm happy enough with the sensor, the M10 body is close to perfect and it's functionality leaves very little to desire. Anyway more megapixels would probably mean me having to upgrade my computing gear too, a hidden expense that I don't want to have to plumb for at this time.........Instead, in the past couple of years, I have invested in analogue cameras again with an M-A last year and a MP a month or so ago, they join my M7 that I had completely overhauled and it's VF upgraded at Wetzlar last year.

The possible mechanicals difficulties on a digital Leica are: 1) as the name suggests, with dual ranges, the DR has two separate focusing cam surfaces (on one cylindrical cam). Using the long-distance range (1m > infinity) the closeup cam, now in the bottom of the lens, can jam or rub against the meter housing on the floor of the M10 shutter chamber as one focuses close to infinity. In my case, this happened only in the last fraction of a mm before reaching infinity, and it did not completely jam; the focusing just got a bit stiffer (and the lens left a little rub-mark inside the M10). 2) The close-up goggles won't always clip completely into place, unless the little black rubber \"bumper\" on the back of the goggles is trimmed to fit (see your picture, black bumper is just peeking over the top, above and behind the words \"Leitz Wetzlar.\" To focus closer than 1 meter, the goggles MUST be mounted on the lens (they unlock the close-focus action by pressing on the \"ball bearing\" on top of the lens mount - see your photo). The whole point of the DR lens and goggles is to focus close using the regular rangefinder and no other accessories. But it can be used with live-view or EVF - still needs the goggles mounted, though, to unlock the closeup range. It is also a bit heavier than most M 50mm f/2s, due to the 1950s build-quality, and the extra metal for extended focusing. At normal focusing distances (1m > infinity) I found the DR to be at least as good, and often better, than more modern 50mm Summicrons - at f/2.0. Stopped down, the differences decrease. Certainly for a 1950s design, it holds up extremely well with age. I.E. I mostly agree with Rockwell's evaluation. In the close range, as with most lenses -----> designed !!!  for longer distances, it is a bit soft at f/2.0, but very sharp stopped down. I used mine in the studio and for other close-range work for a couple of months - and still sell prints from some of its images. But I'm not excited by \"old stuff\" just for its own sake, and ultimately a 75mm Summarit f/2.4 gave me tighter cropping and equal resolution with less fiddling around with goggles and \"gear changes\" on the lens.

Image sensors all only have one \"real\" ISO, called the base ISO. Which creates the optimal and most efficient sensor output - one photon in knocks loose one electron to be captured and counted, with no overflow. For the M10 24Mpixel color sensor, this is about \"ISO 135-ish\" according to Leica. An analogy would be - put a needle on a rotating vinyl/wax sound recording, and the needle will vibrate and put out a given amount of sound all by itself. That is its \"base volume.\" The original \"phonographs\" amplified the sound with a megaphone or trumpet - eventually electrical devices were used to amplify the vibrations (or \"signal\") instead. --img--  All the other ISOs a digital camera may offer come from processing the base ISO image with additional processing chips. Amplifying or \"pushing\" it to a higher ISO get a usable image using less light, or to a lesser extent subduing it with de-amplification (\"pulling\") to get a lower apparent ISO, a stronger signal and thus slightly less noise (better signal/noise ratio). I guess those could be called \"virtual ISOs.\" But I've never head that term used. The ability to \"pull\" a digital image is very limited, since the base ISO is already using the full capacity of the sensor's \"pixel wells\" that store the electrons, and adding more light very quickly overflows the capacity of the wells to distinguish bright things, leading to \"blown\" highlights without detail. On the basic M10, ISO 100 is a slight \"pull\" of the base ISO, and ISO 200 or higher are \"pushes\" of the base ISO (weaker and weaker native signals (sensor exposed to less light than optimal), amplified more and more, and thus acquiring more and more noise.) And for whatever reason (probably to maintain even steps: 100, 200, 400, etc., on the mechanical ISO knob), Leica does not allow accessing and using the actual base ISO. ................... As to digital ISO compared to film ISO, the ISO (International Organization for Standards) standards for measuring each are completely different. Film ISOs are determined by measuring shadow density (although Ilford, for example, doesn't use the ISO method, for their own films). Digital ISOs are measured differently based on signal, noise, midtones - and only for .jpgs, since each photographer will do their own processing with raw of .DNG files). Nevertheless, in practical use, they are generally close, so that an external independent light meter, which has no idea what camera one is using, should produce equally-bright pictures from the same light, subject, and manual camera settings. The only way to really test that is a direct comparison with a color slide film of ISO 100 (no -----> printing !!!  corrections allowed) and a digital .jpg taken at the same aperture and shutter speed at ISO 100 (no photographer post-processing - \"straight from the camera\"). The ISO organization doesn't come close to doing such a test, and I suspect most camera makers don't bother, either. DxO claims their testing system comes close, but it's still based on a \"virtual\" mathematical model, not shooting Velvia 100 alongside an M10 or the other cameras they test.

This is because the rangefinder, unlike a view camera, SLR, or EVF camera, does not inspect the lens\u2019 image directly to evaluate focus. Instead, one mechanism gauges distance to subject (the wheel at the top of the shutter box and the mechanics it attaches to in the camera, and the ring that moves in and out of the inside of the mount of the lens), and an independent mechanism adjusts the lens to focus at that distance (the distance between sensor and lens mount in the camera, including film plane flatness where relevant, and the movement of the optical cell(s) relative to the mount in the lens). Both systems must agree in box camera and lens to achieve optimum focus. This is a surprisingly complex problem. Possibilities that come to mind for a system that focuses past infinity in the center of the frame include: It might be working as intended.

It might be working as intended, part two: the lens was calibrated to place focus in the middle of the thickness of a sheet of film, but it is being used on a digital sensor which does not behave as if it has thickness. In this case, the lens is effectively focusing behind the sensor, so focusing closer (moving the lens away from the sensor) improves resolution. It might be working as intended, part three: all lenses have aberrations, some of these aberrations occur mostly in front of or behind the focus plane, and some of those are reduced when changing aperture. Removing aberrations in front of the focus plane will shift optimum focus backwards without changing actual focus at all. Designers of lenses with this focus shift behavior must choose which aperture the focus setting is optimized for.

Instead, one mechanism gauges distance to subject (the wheel at the top of the shutter box and the mechanics it attaches to in the camera, and the ring that moves in and out of the inside of the mount of the lens), and an independent mechanism adjusts the lens to focus at that distance (the distance between sensor and lens mount in the camera, including film plane flatness where relevant, and the movement of the optical cell(s) relative to the mount in the lens).

I am not arguing what it should mean, but wondering what it means in the context of your post... Essentially that the mid-tones fall on Zone V, if that there is where I want them; and for shots into the light, or with strong sidelight, when I'm exposing for the high-lights, that the main subject is exposed where I want it, after I lift shadows and mid-tones to where I want them. My issue with the M10 is that it's necessary to underexpose too much when exposing for the highlights, compared to many other cameras (the Ricoh GRIII in my case), and that this results from the contrast curve that Leica applied to the M10 DNGs, which allocates too little of the available dynamic range to the highlights. Sorry that I wrote such a long off-topic post above, but it's an issue that I'm interested in and @otto.f's post touched on that. On the topic of this thread itself, I agree with @pedaes's thought that it would be interesting to have a comparison of Lightroom Super Resolution to the Topaz AI tools; and also agree with @Jeff S's statement that the necessary sensor resolution really depends on what the photographer wants. This has a long history. On the old Leica forums, people would say that, if you wanted print's larger than 11x14 \u2014 or even 8x10, though some said 16x20 \u2014 you needed to go to medium format film.

The prints were dazzling, but clearly this type of high-contrast work requires less resolution than certain types of landscape.

Lighting and composition just become that much more important in the absence of color to offset any deficiencies in image content, and therein lies the value; it imposes a somewhat forced mental discipline to strip down a scene to its bare essentials, and I think this really challenges our creative side. I find myself fancying this once again, rather than \"after the fact\" as it were when recording a color image. The effectively higher resolution of the M10M is a nice bonus, but its really the constraint imposed by imaging with B&W only that I want to experience once again. Based on prints from the M10-R and my SL2, I suspect the M10M might well represent an entirely new level of image quality, that may even come close to those drum scans of days gone by, at least for the 17x22/16x24 sizes that I enjoy -----> printing !!!  at.

I would def. recommend the M10-P instead of the M10-R for a few reasons: - 24MP allows to shoot slower shutter speeds (ie 1/60 with a 50mm or 1/30 with a 35mm), whereas with 40MP I felt I had to keep the shutter speed at 1/250 to get sharp pictures. That\u2019s fine if it\u2019s the Monochrom, given it has an insane ISO performance, but with the M10R you don\u2019t get the same kind of ISO performance and are losing 2/3 stops of light due to this factor. - 40MP gives you huge files, which are great if you want to -----> print !!!  or crop a lot, but there are also cons such as slower transferring times to the laptop, larger files to save on your limited storage, and more power required to edit them - M10P design is cleaner too without the Leica red dot in the middle, and you can get it in silver or black.

In modern (post-1935) color film there are three stacked layers for the three primary colors to be recorded (red, green, blue). It has a very simple and unorganized structure, relatively speaking.

At least for general-purpose photography - special films and special lenses for technical or scientific work may have paid more precise attention to details. Next let us look at how the 28mm G-Rokkor or other compact short-focus lenses for Leica-type camera bodies work. One advantage of the Leica and other rangefinder cameras (and, of course, the recent \"mirrorless\" cameras) is that there is nothing inside the camera between the lens and the film except about 3mm of \"shutter curtains.\" (Unlike SLRs, which need about 40-45mm of space between the lens and shutter for the reflex mirror to flip up and down). Leica cameras and the lenses for them standardize on about 28mm between the lens mount and the film, with the lenses often protruding even deeper into the camera than the mount (as your 28mm G-Rokkor does): http://www.9days.hk/uploads/product/13F047_03.jpg But what really matters is that your lens and similar 28mm lenses capture a view of the world that is 65\u00b0 wide across the long dimension of a 24x36 negative or sensor. And in designs for the Leica, the lenses are relatively symmetrical, so that the light coming out of the lens at the back to hit the film also covers a total angle of about 65\u00b0. At each end of a horizontal picture, the light from the edges of your subject area is thus hitting the film (or sensor) at an angle of about 32.5\u00b0 from the vertical - the \"angle of incidence.\" http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/AngleOfIncidence_800.gif Light passing straight through the lens from the center of the subject to the center of the film or sensor has an angle of incidence of zero. As we mentioned, film is relatively insensitive to the incoming angle of light rays, so lens designers knew that almost any angle of incidence would work. Unlike film, digital sensors have a very complex and non-homogenous 3D microscopic structure of silicon, glass, colored filters, etc. If one thinks of film as a smooth meadow, a digital sensor is like an inner city, divided up into blocks of tall buildings (on a microscopic scale). The net result is that digital sensors are far more \"sensitive\" than film to angle of incidence, and thus misbehave with lenses with a large angle of incidence at the picture edges/corners, that worked perfectly well on film. On the whole, current digital sensors work best when the angle of incidence is closer to zero. Horizontally, sensors are divided up into squares - the pixels - each with different color filtering, the Bayer pattern or Bayer filter array. One key point suspected in the \"Italian Flag\" problem is that the Bayer filter pattern is not symmetrical - the blue pixels are always biased to one side while the red pixels are biased to the other side, no matter how you turn the pattern: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Bayer_pattern.svg/2000px-Bayer_pattern.svg.png Vertically, sensors are divided up into several layers, and most importantly, the imaging areas of the silicon (D and E) are not flat and homogenous, but deep \"wells\" divided by solid-state circuitry.

Leica cameras and the lenses for them standardize on about 28mm between the lens mount and the film, with the lenses often protruding even deeper into the camera than the mount (as your 28mm G-Rokkor does): http://www.9days.hk/uploads/product/13F047_03.jpg But what really matters is that your lens and similar 28mm lenses capture a view of the world that is 65\u00b0 wide across the long dimension of a 24x36 negative or sensor. And in designs for the Leica, the lenses are relatively symmetrical, so that the light coming out of the lens at the back to hit the film also covers a total angle of about 65\u00b0. At each end of a horizontal picture, the light from the edges of your subject area is thus hitting the film (or sensor) at an angle of about 32.5\u00b0 from the vertical - the \"angle of incidence.\" http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/AngleOfIncidence_800.gif Light passing straight through the lens from the center of the subject to the center of the film or sensor has an angle of incidence of zero. As we mentioned, film is relatively insensitive to the incoming angle of light rays, so lens designers knew that almost any angle of incidence would work. Unlike film, digital sensors have a very complex and non-homogenous 3D microscopic structure of silicon, glass, colored filters, etc. If one thinks of film as a smooth meadow, a digital sensor is like an inner city, divided up into blocks of tall buildings (on a microscopic scale). The net result is that digital sensors are far more \"sensitive\" than film to angle of incidence, and thus misbehave with lenses with a large angle of incidence at the picture edges/corners, that worked perfectly well on film. On the whole, current digital sensors work best when the angle of incidence is closer to zero. Horizontally, sensors are divided up into squares - the pixels - each with different color filtering, the Bayer pattern or Bayer filter array. One key point suspected in the \"Italian Flag\" problem is that the Bayer filter pattern is not symmetrical - the blue pixels are always biased to one side while the red pixels are biased to the other side, no matter how you turn the pattern: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Bayer_pattern.svg/2000px-Bayer_pattern.svg.png Vertically, sensors are divided up into several layers, and most importantly, the imaging areas of the silicon (D and E) are not flat and homogenous, but deep \"wells\" divided by solid-state circuitry. Additionally important to the purple-corner problem is the existence of microlenses (F) capping each pixel, to refocus light down into the \"wells\". http://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2010/08/Sensors1.jpg This diagram demonstrates one current idea about what may cause the purple-corners or Italian-flag effects - leakage and/or reflection of light already filtered for one color (in this case green) into a neighboring pixel programmed to measure a different color (in this case blue). Due to the gaps between the vertical layers, the vertical structures, and the angle at which the incoming light hits the microlenses or the underlying silicon. And resulting in excess blue signal on one side of the picture, and (due to the bias of the Bayer pattern) excess red signal on the opposite side of the picture. http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Wiring-diagram-for-a-typical-front-illuminated-sensor.gif Here are some real-world photomicrographs of an image sensor that may help clarify what the schematics above are showing, especially the 3D \"wiring\" etched into the silicon: https://petapixel.com/2013/02/12/what-a-dslrs-cmos-sensor-looks-like-under-a-microscope/ You may ask why Sony and other mirrorless cameras and lenses do not have as much problem as Leica's lenses. And the answer is, Sony and Fuji and Olympus have -----> designed !!!  their mirrorless-system lenses specifically for digital sensors right from the beginning, with optics that reduce the angles of incidence.

I agree with that. A Leica CL is a really cool companion to the M10... And I love shooting with the CL and M lenses for completely different reasons than I love the M10. - Is the camera just a secondary thing and hangs around your shoulder? CL is lighter and less expensive so I feel less protective about it (with Elmarit 28). So it's not just a backup, it can have it's purpose depending on the intent before leaving home. - Focal lengths/ compositioning (lack of better words) change with the 1,5x crop and it stays fun and interesting. - Feeling of the CL in your hand is sooo much better than other brands (my opinion), I feel right at home with the menu and I like the first page, this information screen like the SL much more than the M10 version. - Focussing with M lenses I think works really well since I have punch-in on the right dial and it became second nature to compose, rotate the dial (needs the official LEICA adapter, no third party one!), watch for the peaking, recompose, shoot. I just really like it... would recommend it.

Quite hard to judge with the big black blob, though, as the main subject determines the quality of the image. As it is, the moment that cameras matched negative film, as they do now, the need for more DR became just for making exposure less critical, nothing more. Not to mention slide film. As an example: here is an image where the camera managed to capture both the detail in the midday Mozambique sun in the background and in the deep shadows of the kitchen.

Basically i used an M240 for the most part of 5 years, itched for something new and went through Sony, Canon, Fuji GFX, Sigma FP, Leica SL/2 cameras before realising I just want to shoot with Leica bodies, and within that brand, preferably M cameras (I only like shooting with M glass so an M camera is best for this, along with the form factor of the body, physical dials, simple button layout, etc.). My process wasn't as \"clean\" as yours in that I still had my M lenses and 1 of my 2 current M bodies whilst going through all those other bodies and systems. In any case, it was plenty of soul searching of sorts and a very restless time gear wise. I'm now perfectly contented with my M10M and M10D, two cameras which I feel compliment each other well. I had always wanted a monochrom and was always drawn to the idea of learning how to shoot in b&w as I never had the discipline to convert my pictures to b&w in post. Likewise, i was always drawn to the idea of a screen-less M. Not that I had any major issues with chimping (or so i didn't think i did, until i got the M10D last month). I chose those 2 cameras because I felt they could teach me more than a colour M could alone. People might dismiss the idea that seeing in black and white changes how you shoot, but I've experienced it first hand, as have you. One is forced to think of better ways to draw the viewer's eye. I move more, I look for stronger lines, contrast and shadow more. It's a subtle shift but it's there. The M10D has made me make sure I get the shot when I'm \"getting the shot\". I don't take for granted that I'm shooting digital so much any more. Being forced to shoot differently with these two cameras has made me improve more than any other camera has, aside from my initial few years with the M240 and with my Nikons when I first started photography. I may be a marketing victim, or convincing myself I made the right choices with the M10M and M10D, but hey if I feel a difference in my shooting and I'm enjoying this hobby more, isn't only relevant barometer the level of satisfaction I derive from using this gear? It's a breath of fresh air and I'm loving it. It's never going to be sensible in the grand scheme of things, to spend money on Leica gear. If I was rational and wanted just one M, I'd have gone with an M10R. If I was rational and just wanted a camera a Nikon Z (or even a DSLR from yesteryears) would suffice. Have the two cameras delivered what I thought they would? Absolutely. And I feel I have plenty to grow into and any limitations are on me. The beauty of the monochroms and the D versions is that you're paying a high price of entry for the concept and way of shooting they promote. It's kinda like paying the high price of entry for an M, but this time a niche within the niche. Once you own a mono/D, even if a new model comes out, the incentives would merely be technological. With cameras this good these days, and with the M10 form factor, it'd be hard to make me give these up for a newer version. I suppose one could argue that if you want to buy the concept, then an M246 and M-D262 would be most economical - however having used the M10 series cameras, I don't think I could go back to the M240 body size and buttons (for M246). Speaking of GFX and Ms, one big reason why I got it was the 40mp bayerless sensor. After my experience with the GFX 50S, I was bitten by the high MP bug. Not because I -----> print !!!  big or leave sloppy composition to be fixed in post, but because every time I zoomed in past 100% in my GFX files, I saw so much it was downright fascinating that I could see all these \"new\" details I was capturing. You might appreciate the M10M or M10R on this basis alone, having come from the GFX100. On lenses on the cameras: I've kinda \"been there, done that\" with most lenses I've wanted. I owned/used fast glass, modern glass, vintage glass, limited edition lenses and sorted through what I wanted in my kit and got rid of the rest. Sometimes I feel I should have kept some of the glass I sold cause I took a while to acquire them, not to forget the adage about never selling Leica lenses. But the clutter bothered me more than the idea of selling them. I more than halved my kit and I now \"only\" have 5. 3 core lenses (28cron, 35FLE, 50APO) and 2 \"extra\"/superfluous ones (50 f1, 75lux) for portraits/Mandler days. My main pairing on the M10M tends to be a 28cron and 50APO. Both of these lenses have great clarity and don't embellish photos excessively, much in line with how I view my black and white shooting (no colours, fancy bokeh to spice up the pictures, but lines, shadows and contrast). One side thing I realised with the M10M is I prefer 28mm or 50mm on b&w whilst I prefer 35mm in colour (or prefer 28mm and 50mm less in colour?). Haven't really figured this one out yet, but it might have to do with 28mm giving more room to compose different angles, and 50mm giving an extra tightness to draw the viewer in. I do admit the 40mp sensor does make me want to put the 50APO on more than any other lens, because it can eek out the extra details. I often get pleasant surprises in my photos when I zoom in. This said, I have used Mandler glass on the M10M due to the charm of shooting oldish glass with b&w. With my glass and the M10M, it's very much \"same same but different\", in a pleasant way. I suppose I'm not really answering your higher MP camera + certain lenses question though, since my response has a b&w slant to it. My 35FLE lives on the M10D. Not much to say about this, as that lens could live on any M and I'd be happy camper (being a 35mm guy). Apologies for the long post.

In one of the SL2-S threads some people are concluding that the SL2-S is the best non-M camera for M-lenses; and better in this respect than the SL2, considering better high ISO performance and, possibly, better color. In my view, this is similar to the difference between the M10/M10-P and the M10-R. I\u2019ve had no interest in the M10-R simply because my photography, which is usually high-contrast, does not need more resolution, even for large prints.

I\u2019ve had no interest in the M10-R, as not only don\u2019t I need its higher resolution but also prefer the smaller files of the M10, which has better high ISO than the M10-R and doesn't need high shutter speeds for eliminating camera shake for handheld photography: @Steven has found that most of his M10-R shots at less than 1/500 sec shutter speeds exhibit camera shake. While some M10-R users state that their camera has better dynamic range than the M10, the graphs on the photonstophotos.net site don\u2019t support that, and indicate the that the M10 may even have a slight advantage in this respect: if you look at the Photo Dynamic Range Chart and, particularly, the Photo Dynamic Range Improvement chart for the M10 vs the M10-R. I shoot with an M10 and a Ricoh GR III, both 24 MP cameras. With the M10, I prefer the OVF and haven\u2019t used the Visoflex EVF that I bought with the camera. With the GRII, I shoot one-handed, and use the LCD on the back only to establish, roughly, the edges of the frame \u2014 and look directly at the subject when pressing the shutter. With both cameras, I\u2019m usually interested in the immediacy of the photography. One of the things I like about the GR III are two of its, adjustable, JPG modes: High-Contrast B&W and Positive Film. I shoot DNG + JPG, and have found, most of the time, that these JPG modes get me closer to where I want to be with the final image than working with the DNG \u2014 and much faster. With the M10, I shoot only DNGs, but feel that Leica should introduce JPG modes that are as good as these two GR III ones. The other thing the GR III has is excellent IBIS. So, my three desiderata for the M10 successor are that it have (1) a 24 MP sensor, (2) good JPG modes, and (3) IBIS \u2014 although the latter may be unlikely. As the image that one can produce is the most important consideration for me, I\u2019ll conclude with three images (that I\u2019ve posted elsewhere). Two are landscapes, because this is the genre for which people generally feel they need maximum MP and the third could be called a \u201cstreet portrait\u201d. (I'm not being critical of people who want high-resolution landscapes, but am only stating what I like for my work).

IBIS would be a grateful feature for sure, but I doubt it's possible. An M camera would be bigger with this technology implement, I guess. There is no more space. And second, besides it's a great and helpful feature on many cameras, I feel that it goes against Rangefinder essence. I don't need help \ud83d\ude02 All mechanic, all natural, all raw. It feels better. It's another game if Leica makes a fusion between the M and the SL system.. So I camera like the Fujix100v ... Rangefinder look, small size, IBIS, flip screen and ....... EVF .....
