I bought the Oberwerth Q bag for my Q2M but still using Ona Bowery for the M10-R.. thinking to replace it with the Ober as I really like the Ober Q. Answering your question.. when the M10 is in the bag I use a wrist strap (I never let the camera hang on it, it is just for security) as I also find to cumbersome using a full length strap in a bag."

This week it happened to me again, M10-P refusing to release the shutter until I lifted my right thumb off the touchscreen. Unexpected, extremely -----> annoying !!!  and unwanted behaviour. What exactly happened during the few times that I ran into this, I really don\u2019t know, difficult to reproduce. It is easy however to bring the M10-P into a state where the shutter refuses to fire; press play, zoom in on the displayed picture with two finger touch, and while still zooming press the release button. Nothing happens. An option to disable the touchscreen would only be a workaround, this is a bug and should be fixed. Back to the M10-R, thank you for posting these pictures."

After repeatedly getting the 'Image Inhomogeneous' message I then tried using a section of uniformly bright sky with a 135 lens at closest focusing distance at f22 and it now works consistently well. Apparently, the M10R may simply need brighter light to do the dust detection test. I wanted to follow up. I attempted some tests with my 135 mm lens. I was able to get it to work on \"occasion,\" perhaps a little more than with other lenses, maybe 1 out of 40 or 50 tries, but it wasn't a repeatable process and seemed random. I appreciated this function on other M's as it was good for an occasional sensor check, but i also found it helpful for finding dust on lenses where i couldn't as easily see the rear lens elements, like the 135 lens where it's far deeper inside the tube. If this is widespread, I'm curious if it can be adjusted in a future firmware update. I wouldn't send my camera in because of this and hoping i never have to send it in for service. This is a great M camera in my opinion and the issue is minor, but slightly -----> annoying !!! ."

I shoot 2x M edition 60s, an M9M and an M240-P (and had an M246) and have been wondering how to consolidate but struggle with rather same thought process, but I worry less about low light ISO as I use Summiluxes and then if it\u2019s too dark for photos IMHO it\u2019s too dark! I could ditch the M9M and just convert colour files to B+W (but lose that mindset/visualisation of shooting in B+W with only B+W RAWs available)* I could ditch the M60s and pretend* that turning off the screen was in some way the same* Or I could just use my M240-P for everything and forget I ever had the others ...\ud83d\ude44 * see previous interminable and -----> annoying !!!  threads re the \u201cjust convert from colour/turn off the screen cos it\u2019s just the same\u201d \ud83d\ude21 IMHO there\u2019s a reason that Leica have made screenless and also B+W-only cameras and there\u2019s surely a tiny, yet unfortunately commercially unsubstainable, Venn Diagram overlap that would be overjoyed with a MxM-D.

The M9 Monochrom which I still have is so much quicker, the M 246 Monochrom and M 262 which I also have are a bit slower than the M9M but a second faster than M10. I remember when Leica M photographers used to discuss the shutter release button on film cameras as which was the crisper and therefore the quickest at catching the moment. I have been debating which Monochrom to keep out of the three and the M9M is looking the likely winner due to it's faster wake up amongst other things. Film to me will always be quicker providing that you have remembered to wind on or as what happened to me recently not put a film in !!"

From pictures on the web the 24meg shots look more artsy and the 40meg have an exciting impact but are more technical in nature. I am preferring the 24meg myself.

I own a 32\" Benq Calibrated Color Photography monitor so I think I am seeing correctly what is there for a comparison.

The only thing holding me back, besides the red dot design, is that I fear to get an image to sharp with the 40 mp. of course, it also changes everything with your post processing workflow, but I won\u2019t get started on that."

I totally agree. Maybe the M10-R 40meg has a lessor file that can be saved to... less meg. Not jpg which I find insulting after spending on an expensive camera. There is a famous photographer on the web that revels in jpg saying all should use it (he shall go nameless) but his commercial work needs that \"punch\" of the narrower color range with the color intensity turned up, so it makes sense to him.

I am really happy with the device. It was only last week that I noticed that the camera draws a lot of power from the battery when it is switched off. Since I haven't managed to leave the camera for a few days yet, I can't give any concrete percentage values here. According to the current observations the loss of electricity is about 20% per day.

I even asked them to bear the cost of shipping for this time but they refused. What makes me really upset is the screen protector was scratched after repairing.

I currently own a Leica M7, which has been my main camera for 3 years and this will be first move to digital. I really love how engaged I am in the moment while shooting film, so I wanted to hang onto that experience, which is why I have chosen the screenless option. Although I love the process of shooting film, I mainly shoot at night where I lack high ISO and sometimes I get lazy when it comes to developing. My current lenses are a 28mm Elmarit and a Voigtlander 35 1.4. 28mm being my favourite length. I will be buying used and my heart was set on an M10-D but while looking online, for the same money I could buy an MD 262 plus a 50 summilux for the same price. A 50 being a lens I have been hoping to buy in the future as I feel the 35 is too close to the lens I shoot most, the 28. So just looking for suggestions, or maybe someone who upgraded from a 240/D262 to an M10/D. Or even someone coming from film. (I will still keep my M7) Any help would be great, thanks. Hello Murdog and welcome to the Forum.......I presently own a MD-10, ( plus a M7 like yourself ), and despite some quirks it is perhaps my favourite digital M so regarding the choices of camera I would definitely go with the M10-D over the MD 262, and here's a couple of reasons why......The better VF, the slimmer nicely balanced body, and the sensitivity and DR of the sensor is improved over the 240/262 in my opinion, ( I used to own a M240 before trading up to the M10's ), PLUS although I first thought that the faux winding lever was a really stupid \"throwback\" idea I'm now completely won over with it to the extent that I wish all other future M's would offer the same thing. I never liked the rear on/off/WiFi switch from day one, I wish that it was in the \"normal\" M position around the shutter release, but I've gotten used to it I guess now. The reliance on Foto's to make changes to the camera setup is also an annoyance for me, but having settled on the best settings for your shooting preferences you can just leave all that alone. I've not changed my M10-D's settings for more than 8 months or so. The fact that you can use the Visoflex 020 with the M10-D may also be a plus for you. I have one, I don't like it on the M's but others do find it a very handy accessory. Lenses? Frankly I think you've got two that are easily way good enough to start with, especially so the 28mm Elmarit which to my mind is one of Leica's best M lenses, also you may find that after using the M10-D for a while that perhaps you do not need to have a fast Summilux 50mm. I personally have found that since going into the M10 range of cameras I have been able to use smaller, marginally slower, lenses without any problem and to my mind the M balances so much better in the hand with the smaller lenses, ( like your present 28mm Elmarit ), larger faster lenses tend to block the VF more too which can be -----> annoying !!! .....they are also quite a lot more expensive! I'd recommend you looking at a 50mm Summarit when you are considering a 50mm, the Summaries are great little lenses and balance beautifully on the cameras. Good luck anyway!"

I think the points you make are very valid and kind of take me back down to earth. I mostly only get the chance to shoot at night and being so used to my M7, a faster lens was my reasoning for the 50 or maybe a 28 summicron. But as you say, with the ISO capability of the m10-D, maybe my 28 Elmarit will be good enough. I love this lens and love the size on my M7. I think I'm sold on the m10-D \ud83d\ude01"

I have a M10-D myself, and I have to say that despite real irritations it is a \"favourite\" M of those that I presently own..............BUT at the same time I've labelled it in other posts the \"Orphan\" M because Leica put it out then totally ignored it as far as any meaningful or useful enhancement of it's capability. I agree that it's -----> annoying !!! , stupid even, that there's no sensor cleaning function...how the hell do we do that? I've disliked the fact that if you mount the Visoflex 020 the GPS is turned on automatically whether you need it or not with no way of turning it off thus being an unnecessary battery drain. Why is there no way to access the camera menu via the 020,? I hate being reliant on Foto's and carrying a 'phone to make settings adjustments, that seems contrary to the whole philosophy of the camera, it should be able to be self contained and independent and not over reliant on Foto's at all. Foto's itself I have always found for me to be finicky and next to useless anyway. Yes I too could rant more. There's a \"Feedback\" option in Foto's whereby you can let Leica know your thoughts on the camera use that for your complaints or suggestions I have a few times although I've yet to receive an answer,......Maybe more \"squeaky wheels\" will get their attention. The camera is, like the Monochroms, a wonderful addition to Leica M's line of cameras, but they made it a three legged horse at best. Surely there was or still could be much more Leica could improve regarding the camera's functions and capabilities and as you say. at least give it more of the software / menu features that the rest of the M10's line enjoy. It is after all an M10 with the absence of the LCD, but I don't think that is ever going to happen and that's a pity because despite real frustrations the concept and much of the execution of the camera is so damn good."
