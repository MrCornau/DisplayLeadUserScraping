But to me the geotagging feature is very important due to my travel pattern.\n\n1. Do you have any issue connecting via Bluetooth to your phone?\n2. Can I set it to where it connects automatically as soon as the camera is switched on and the phone is nearby?\n3. How bad does it drain the battery?\n4. When there is cellular coverage, does the geotagging still work?\n5. Does it record the coordinate on RAW and JPEG? Or only JPEG?\n\nThank you so much!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/n04k5v/question_canon_m6_mark_ii_geotagginggps/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": true, "Selector": "geotagging", "selectorShort": "geotagging", "MarkedSent": "question: canon m6 mark ii -----> geotagging !!! /gps /!/ hi redditors!\n\ni seriously consider getting a canon m6 mark ii and have a question about the geotagging feature.\n\ni\u2019m not a professional photographer - just a hobbyist. but to me the geotagging feature is very important due to my travel pattern.\n\n1. do you have any issue connecting via bluetooth to your phone?\n2. can i set it to where it connects automatically as soon as the camera is switched on and the phone is nearby?\n3. how bad does it drain the battery?\n4. when there is cellular coverage, does the geotagging still work?\n5. does it record the coordinate on raw and jpeg? or only jpeg?\n\nthank you so much!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 38344, "year": "2021"}], "name": "geotaggingcanon2021"}
