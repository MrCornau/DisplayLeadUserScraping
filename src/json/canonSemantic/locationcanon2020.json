I bought the 5D as an early-career side hustle in event photographer and videographer around 2013 when I was just out of grad school and starting to freelance, and it was great for the time. I moved to a small town in 2016 and didn't continue this freelance work, but I still enjoy having the capacity to do run-and-gun documentary filmmaking when the need arises.  \n\nMy primary discipline has always been music, and I've had to quickly pivot from touring for live performances to a combination of livestream concerts and pre-recorded concert videos which I typically do on location. I've had access to a Panasonic Lumix G85 through my day job, which was a pleasant surprise and has shown me the age of the 5Dii. Things I particularly enjoyed were 4K editing, especially to crop and pan in post, and the lack of the 30 minute cutoff (come on, Canon....), though I output in 1080p for most distribution. I did a two-camera shoot with the Canon and Panasonic and had a lot of difficulty grading the flat Canon footage to better match the Panasonic.\n\nI'm pretty invested in the Canon ecosystem, and own a first-gen 24-105mm f/4 L, a 50mm f/1.4, and a 105mm f/2.8L macro. I also have a good video monopod, tripod, a fair amount of outboard audio gear, and a Godox speedlight. \n\nI've been researching a few months, and I'm looking at an upgrade to the EOS RP with the ER 35mm macro, along with the control ring adapter. I love the specs of the R6, but don't use the camera as much as I used to, and I like the idea of getting some new glass and an extra battery for less than an EOS R body.\n\nI'm not thrilled with the reviews of the EOS RP 4K footage and would welcome experience - I was looking at the 90D as an alternative to have uncropped footage, but then reminded myself that a cropped RP isn't so different from shooting on the 90D. \n\ntl;dr, my wishlist for intended use\n\n* using my full-frame EF glass (is the control ring worth it?)\n* video, top priority documenting living room and outdoor concerts in either 1080 or 4K\n* video livestreaming in 1080, (I have an Elgato cam link 4K, can somebody confirm clean HDMI out?)\n* my partner is an artisan that has been experimenting in product photography and macro photography. We recently shot a billboard on the 5Dii that consisted of 30+ stitched together images, and extra MP over the 5Dii is a help. The additional resolution of the EOS R is tempting, but then I wouldn't be buying any glass right away.\n* I find I don't carry my 5D anymore because it's too bulky, so I like the idea of switching over to mirrorless. I started back in 2010 on an early Sony mirrorless and loved the size before switching to Canon DSLR. My photography needs would be mostly travel/landscape and occasional headshot/portrait. \n* I've been wanting to get a 35mm prime for years, debating between the Sigma ART and a stabilized Canon. I like the idea of having an everyday walkaround that's compact, and for living room concerts 50mm has been too tight of a frame so I think 35 is my ideal focal length to start with, though I'll also be adapting my EF glass. \n\nAm I on the right page?
