It started getting me out of the house to walk and just be more active as well so thats a big plus. \n\nI love street photography and portraits mainly. Im currently using the m50 with the kit lens, 22 f2 and 50mm Yongnuo with the regular adapter. \n\nSo far my experience has been pretty positive, although being honest i haven\u2019t got much to compare to since its my first camera. \n\nThe main things i \u201clack\u201d or wish were a little better:\n\n-Separate dials for exposure (Shutter, Aperture, ISO) i did change some of my buttons and i kind of control them without the touch screen but doesn\u2019t feel as fast as having dedicated dials. \n\n-low light feels kind of restrictive. I know this is also very lens dependant but i feel anything above 1600 iso is pretty risky. \n\n-Better battery life. Kind of a tough one since i love mirrorless and honestly i don\u2019t want to jump to full frame bodies or lenses that are just too expensive for a casual like me.\n\n-Fear of investing on Ef-m Lenses. I really want to get the Sigma trio, im in love with primes and those look really tempting, but i feel like canon could pretty much stop the Efm line and then the lenses will be pretty much stuck with me so to speak. \n\n-Some type of weather sealing would be nice to be able to shoot under rain or snow. Not really what i want the most but would be sweet. \n\nPretty much thats it, i honestly am very happy with my modest setup and im very excited about just going out and shooting. I do not want to give up the lightweight of my setup nor to go deep onto very expensive waters. Just wanna know if you guys think theres something i should improve, or maybe just get more lenses to try new things, or just plain wait out what cannon has to offer this year. \n\nI was really watching the m6 mkii, but giving up the fully articulate screen and the evf (which i don\u2019t use that much tbh) for the uncropped 4k basically and other improvements wasn\u2019t as convincing. But then again im in no position to know really if its worth of an upgrade. \n\nThanks in advance for reading/replying.\n\nHope you\u2019re all safe.\n\nNOTE: BTW im pretty heavy on the Photography side , finished a lot of courses and instructional videos on lynda/LinkedIn Learning, but haven\u2019t really gotten to video yet.

So bear that in mind.\n\n&lt;&gt; Ergonomics:\n\n\\+ Nice materials, feel solid in hand;\n\n\\+ Control ring in lens (and in the adapter when I get it) is very nice;\n\n\\- Tiny. Pinky dangling from the bottom tiny;\n\n\\- Second dial is in an uncomfortable position;\n\n\\- Really miss the back dial and extra buttons from something like a 6d;\n\n&lt;&gt; Performance:\n\n\\+ Quick to boot up and in use, interface is snappy.\n\n\\+ Good auto focus modes, initial point tracking is great;\n\n\\+ Wifi transfer speeds are double or more than my m50;\n\n\\- Auto focus from f6.3 up is very poor. Even at proper exposure 1/125 f6.3 ISO 1000 it will hunt occasionally and is not reliable from there;\n\n\\- Tracking shutter speed is slow;\n\n\\- Atrocious battery life.
