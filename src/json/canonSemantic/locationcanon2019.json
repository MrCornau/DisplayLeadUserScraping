I'm a part-time photographer. Right now, I'm splitting my time between shooting and working at a camera shop! I picked up the RP a few weeks ago and I wanted to share some thoughts about using it professionally.\n\nAfter taking some time to get used to the camera, I picked a surprise/paparazzi engagement job. Simple work, but there's certainly a degree of pressure.\n\nI arrived early, scouted the location and was able to get my exposure set up. I wanted to deliver a nice, soft, bokehlicious shot, so I was shooting a very low f-stop. I picked the most likely single AF point to ensure that I hit the face/eye.\n\nHere's were things went wrong.\n\nAnyways, the couple arrives and the guy recognizes that I'm nearby and he drops to one knee. It could have been a miscommunication, or maybe he was justifiably anxious/excited ... but I had expected them to walk to me at a different location. I'm about 25 yards away from the couple. I had to sprint to get the shot. Because the location changed, my settings were off by about half of a stop. I recognized this immediately in the EVF and quickly corrected. Touch and drag AF allowed me to fix my focus point with a flick of my thumb. I got the shot.\n\nSo yeah, I clickbaited you a bit with the title. The RP was fine.\n\nI thought I missed the joystick, but after that shoot, I'm convinced that Canon's Touch and Drag AF is a worthy replacement. A joystick would have been too slow in this circumstance. And while there is a similar feature on Sony, I found it operates more as an anti-feature where your nose moves your AF point. Honestly, I'd like to see Canon ditch the sensor bar on the R and experiment with a small touch pad for quickly adjusting focus.\n\nAlso, it's entirely possibly that I would have recognized my exposure was off while using an SLR. However, I was running and gunning. And the couple was out in the open against a bright, overcast sky. It would have been very, very easy to over or underexpose the shot. However, with the EVF, I was able to accurately correct my exposure in real time.\n\nBurst shooting is slow. This is known. I'm very happy with the photos I got, especially under the circumstances, but I do wish I had more options for what I delivered. On the other hand, in most applications, I found that having high FPS is a double edged sword. With high FPS burst, there are more shots to choose from and a higher likelihood that you'll capture *the* moment. In my experience, I find that I spend a lot of time trying to pick between three nearly identical images and it slows down my workflow. On high FPS cameras, I almost always turn down the burst rate. To be clear, I'm not counting this a point for the RP. I'd always prefer being able to lower settings when I don't need them. \n\nAdmittedly, a single card slot made me nervous. However, even when I've had cameras with two slots, I shoot RAW+JPEG as an emergency backup.  So, for me, this was the first test of Canon's Instant Transfer feature. It performed well, files zipped over to my phone, however, it definitely did not give me the same piece of mind that a second SD card would. Maybe as I use it more, I'll trust it more.\n\nThat all said, I definitely will not be skiddish about using the RP professionally. I'm going to be stocking up on batteries and I may start taking a tablet to transfer jpegs to instead of my phone. I'll probably buy the pro-level Canon mirrorless when it's available, but the RP will carry me through the next year or so. And the $1000 I saved on it over the R is going to be spent on a 2.8 zoom later the year.\n\nI wanted to make this post because there seems to be a lot of interest in this camera in this sub. According to the wider internet, the RP is seemingly hardly better than a Rebel (side note: I had a T2i when people started paying me for photos). I've seen the RP referred to as \"trash\" and that it would never be used by \"serious photographers.\" Being disappointed at the lack of video features or battery life is one thing, but the hate is hyperbolic. I think the naysaying is probably enough to scare away some people from trying one out.\n\nIt's entirely possible that I may feel differently in the future as I do more and find limitations of the camera, but for now, I'm satisfied.
