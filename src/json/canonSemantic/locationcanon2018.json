I learned that the t5i will hit the 4GB file size limit in about 12m05s but compensates for this by starting a new video right away, which was great. I also learned that, for a show that went extremely long, four batteries and three 32GB SD cards was cutting it close. I\u2019ll be better prepared on that end next time.\n\nNow having the resulting videos, I wanted to ask for tips on how I could improve (samples at the bottom).\n\nHere were the circumstances and my approach:\n\nI was sitting in an lecture auditorium that some student groups now use for stage plays and productions like the one I was asked to film. The students rented a t5i with a 18-135mm lens. Originally I tried standing at the back of the auditorium and filming from there, but everything looked sort of blobby, so I instead took a seat around 10-15 rows up from the front and used a tripod. Thankfully, nobody tall wanted to sit in front of me and the people sitting behind me also didn\u2019t mind. My technique was to allow the autofocus to set the focus of the camera at first, and then flip the camera into manual so that nothing would change throughout the recording (which has happened to me in a different venue but I couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to fix it on the fly, so I ended up getting a really blurry last minute or so of a performance.)\n\nThe play/musical had three different general lighting patterns. The first was all lights on stage up. The second was lights dim with spotlights. The third was stage lights out with spotlights. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to try to adjust for this on the fly because I hadn\u2019t seen the show before and didn\u2019t know when the lights transitions would be, so instead I hedged my bets and went for the previously mentioned AF method at the beginning of each act and left it as is. The result is that the scenes with the most light look great, while especially in the scenes with just spotlights, the people on stage look really blown out.\n\nI used the onboard mic for all of the audio recording and this ended up being sort of okay. Some of the dialogue and rapping is a bit muddled, but there was little I could do about it. There are mics that the students could have rented, but I didn\u2019t know how to make a recommendation for this not having ever used a mic with a DSLR before.\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n*For people who have shot video in these situations before, is there anything I should have been paying attention to or settings I should have been using / practicing more with to figure out how to improve the recordings, in terms of visual quality?\n*In the same situation, how much will a separate mic make a difference_x0010_? In an ideal world I think I\u2019d set up a mic on stage and then sync it to the video, but that\u2019s a bit more effort than I think I could expend on this project (also these students contacted me just ten days before the show to ask if I could do this.)\n*There are a handful of other lenses available through their student tech rental program. One of them is a macro so I know it wouldn\u2019t matter here, but the other was a 70-200mm. It wasn\u2019t available this time, but I\u2019m thinking that one might have been useful if I had set up in the back of the auditorium.
