I've walked through all the different support pages, instructions, videos etc. On the camera it seems to be indicating it has connected (or is connecting?) to the iMac (meaning I already went through all the steps as far as finding our wireless network etc).\n\nAt one point I was able to upload to the Canon image gateway which then seemed to send the images to the computer. Weird process...But also, it put those into a folder called \"Transferred\" and I couldn't find a way to just get them into Mac \"Photos\" library.  \n\nThis is so bizarrely difficult (I'm fairly computer savvy - or thought I was!). I just want to connect to my wireless network or iMac and import my images into Photos. Seems like it doesn't want to do that.\n\nAnyone had any experience with this or workarounds known?", "autor": "MiniJunkie", "date": 1514953032000, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/7ns68f/having_trouble_connecting_elph_360_hs_to_imac/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": false, "selectorShort": "None", "MarkedSent": "Having trouble connecting ELPH 360 HS to iMac /!/ Hi folks,\n\nWe just updated to a 2017 iMac, and have 10.13 High Sierra OS installed.\n\nI also got my wife a Powershot ELPH 360 HS wireless camera for Christmas.\n\nI'll be damned if I can get the camera to connect to the Mac.
