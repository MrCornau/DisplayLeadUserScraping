I do understand that I am in for a tough find, since my requirements are quite...peculiar:\n\n\\- The tripod should be stable enough and tolerate some weight since I will be using my M50 mk2 in portrait mode/orientation for my livestreams and recordings. So yeah, a tripod that doesn't tip/fall over when in portrait orientation would be great.\n\n\\- It should have some height adjustment availability, but no need for that much.\n\n\\- It shouldn't be too bulky aka take up too much space.\n\n\\- It cannot be a table-mounted one, unfortunately. That'll be way too non-practical for me.\n\n\\- Budget: About \u20ac50 / $60.
