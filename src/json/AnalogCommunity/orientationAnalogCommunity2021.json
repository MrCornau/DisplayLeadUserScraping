I thought that I would do something different than a \u2018here is my gear\u2019 post \u2013 so here is my review of an AWESOME camera, you may not be aware of. This will be a long one, so I\u2019ll do a TLDR version at the end!\n\n[My first outing with the GX680iii and a woefully flimsy tripod](https://preview.redd.it/ta926eodlhz61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebbbfb6d5407980b4fe68e80f9eb20edd0210709)\n\nHow I got the camera. In the first lockdown I was bored, and a bit tipsy. I was looking at 4x5 cameras on eBay, as I want wanted to play with movements etc. I then stumbled across an auction with 45 minutes to go for a fuji 120 camera that had front movements. There was not much around on the web about it, but what I did find was pretty complimentary. I had a sneaky bid, and won! My rationale was mostly based on the fact that if I got a 4x5, I would need to spend \u00a350 odd on a spool for my developing tank, and upgrade my scanner, as my current one will only scan up to 120 film. In addition\u2026 \u00a36 a shot? Yeah\u2026. Maybe not eh!?\n\n**The Camera:** \n\nFirstly let\u2019s just talk image quality. The lenses are AMAZING! Super sharp, and the resolution you can achieve is as good as, if not better than Hasselblad &amp; Lecia. Yeah. I said it. With that out of the way, I want to focus on what makes the camera REALLY special. The first is the movements. You can move the lens up and down, as well as swing and tilt. This gives you a phenomenal amount of control for your image. I am new to using this, but for those who don\u2019t know the advantages of it, it means that by tilting the focal plane of the image to match lets say a fence in an image, you can secure that whole section in focus, without having an enormous aperture. Conversely, when taking a portrait, you can ensure a super shallow DoF with a tilt, rendering the rest of the image with a lovely out of focus blur. Now yes, you CAN do this with a lower aperture, but the effect is different, as hopefully the images below demonstrate. Please note not all the images are mine \u2013 they are just to show what you can do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Note how the fence is sharp all through the image due to the swing](https://preview.redd.it/o5skaotjlhz61.jpg?width=1875&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45179ebcd9b5d1b2a943a18ae6ddfeabc8df7854)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See the top half of the models face &amp; hair is in focus, where the bottom half is out of focus due to tilt. ](https://preview.redd.it/1s2f7zcnlhz61.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a145dddc4e67694d5e3a9b49d454aa190060f7)\n\nThe second feature that I love about this camera is that it is version 3, which is what I have, is multi-format! What\u2019s more, you don\u2019t need to but a special back, you have a cool little plastic insert that CHANGES your 6x8 back, into a 6x7, 6x6 or 6x4.5. There are also focusing screens that you drop in, so that you can frame the image. Of course, the back rotates, so that you can easily change orientation from the default landscape, to portrait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Comes in a 6x7 option \\(above\\) as well as 6x6 and 6x4.5](https://preview.redd.it/wj3w099slhz61.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea0ce6f55288fad03deb1396304e449feaff9bd)\n\nThe \u2018not so great\u2019 aspect of the camera. Its size. I call it \u2018the beast\u2019 for good reason. This thing is ENORMOUS and weighs a TON! You need a sturdy Manfrotto Tripod, and although you can, you really should not try and shoot this hand held. For comparison, see the camera compared to my 503, and even the back alone compared to a Mamiya 6! They are virtually the same size! I have taken the Fuji GX680iii out in the wild. But it is a camera you definitely have to deliberately \u2018want\u2019 to take out with you. That being said I am trying to take it out more when I have the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This gives you an idea of its size compared to the Hasselblad 503](https://preview.redd.it/7ez87rm3mhz61.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=756c9d04972481ebcbd1d1cbf3460acd96493e11)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The back, compared to my Mamiya 6!](https://preview.redd.it/rb1ne5d7mhz61.jpg?width=3222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e41a6e1b6fcda02a4fbc809bfe8ee2b2476b73)\n\nI would say that the Fuji GX680iii is really like the love child of an RZ67 Proii and a Toyo 45a. Bellows focusing medium format camera, with the benefits of the movements and multi-format features of a 4x5, but at a THIRD of the cost of either. The lenses are very reasonable as well, around \u00a3100-\u00a3250\n\nIn regards to \u2018who uses it\u2019 it is really a studio beast. For name dropping I came up with Sails Chong, who is this crazy AF Chinese photographer, whose work you should defiantly check out. He is now a Hasselblad ambassador. Think Tyler shields, but more photoshop! \n\nSo, to summarise, it is an AMAZING camera which I think would serve as a really good bridge for someone considering 4x5, but not quite sure they will use the movements enough to invest in all the extra bits. For me a new spool, scanner and enlarger is just too much. Let alone the cost of shooting 4x5\u2026 at least not yet. I get most of the features, and in some ways more, with a still pretty big negative, for less cost.  There is an \u2018S\u2019 version, which doesn\u2019t have the movements. I don\u2019t see the point in that. And the earlier versions are not multi format in the same way. Version 3 really is the one to get. \n\nI hope that you have found my review interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Paragraph 1:** Hi, I\u2019m new, and I thought I would do a review. \n\n**Paragraph 2:** I was tipsy during lockdown 1 and brought a medium format Fuji with movements. Seemed a better deal than 4x5 due to additional costs associated with 4x5 with similar results. \n\n**Paragraph 3:** Tilt, shift and swing controls on a medium format camera is amazing, gives you huge control, and gives you more creative options. \n\n**Paragraph 4:** Its MULTI-FORMAT! Special inserts (not new backs) mean you can turn your 6x8 into a 6x7, 6x6, or 645. It has focus screens, and you can rotate the back. \n\n**Paragraph 5:** Its bloody huge and weighs a ton \u2013 its tough to hand hold and you need to be fit as a soldier to carry it any kind of distance. \n\n**Paragraph 6:** I would say that the Fuji GX680iii is really like the love child of an RZ67 Proii and a Toyo 45a.\n\n**Paragraph 7:** Name drop \u2013 Sails Chong\n\n**Paragraph 8:** It is great \u2013 get version 3, but it weighs a ton. A nice bridge between 4x5 and medium format.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ndoss1/fuji_gx680_the_best_camera_you_have_probably/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "orientation", "selectorShort": "orientation", "MarkedSent": "fuji gx680 - the best camera you have (probably) never heard of /!/ hello everyone, \n\nlong-time lurker, first time poster. i thought that i would do something different than a \u2018here is my gear\u2019 post \u2013 so here is my review of an awesome camera, you may not be aware of. this will be a long one, so i\u2019ll do a tldr version at the end!\n\n[my first outing with the gx680iii and a woefully flimsy tripod](https://preview.redd.it/ta926eodlhz61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebbbfb6d5407980b4fe68e80f9eb20edd0210709)\n\nhow i got the camera. in the first lockdown i was bored, and a bit tipsy. i was looking at 4x5 cameras on ebay, as i want wanted to play with movements etc. i then stumbled across an auction with 45 minutes to go for a fuji 120 camera that had front movements. there was not much around on the web about it, but what i did find was pretty complimentary. i had a sneaky bid, and won!

\n\nso, to summarise, it is an amazing camera which i think would serve as a really good bridge for someone considering 4x5, but not quite sure they will use the movements enough to invest in all the extra bits. for me a new spool, scanner and enlarger is just too much. let alone the cost of shooting 4x5\u2026 at least not yet. i get most of the features, and in some ways more, with a still pretty big negative, for less cost.  there is an \u2018s\u2019 version, which doesn\u2019t have the movements. i don\u2019t see the point in that. and the earlier versions are not multi format in the same way. version 3 really is the one to get. \n\ni hope that you have found my review interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**tldr**\n\n**paragraph 1:** hi, i\u2019m new, and i thought i would do a review. \n\n**paragraph 2:** i was tipsy during lockdown 1 and brought a medium format fuji with movements. seemed a better deal than 4x5 due to additional costs associated with 4x5 with similar results. \n\n**paragraph 3:** tilt, shift and swing controls on a medium format camera is amazing, gives you huge control, and gives you more creative options. \n\n**paragraph 4:** its multi-format! special inserts (not new backs) mean you can turn your 6x8 into a 6x7, 6x6, or 645. it has focus screens, and you can rotate the back. \n\n**paragraph 5:** its bloody huge and weighs a ton \u2013 its tough to hand hold and you need to be fit as a soldier to carry it any kind of distance. \n\n**paragraph 6:** i would say that the fuji gx680iii is really like the love child of an rz67 proii and a toyo 45a.\n\n**paragraph 7:** name drop \u2013 sails chong\n\n**paragraph 8:** it is great \u2013 get version 3, but it weighs a ton. a nice bridge between 4x5 and medium format.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 10491, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 265177, "autor": "stanwoodmusic", "date": 1610694621000, "content": "Does anybody here have any experience with the Shen Hao TFC69-A? /!/  I'm looking at this camera thinking it might be my dream camera but I can't tell if it allows for portrait orientation of the film holder.
