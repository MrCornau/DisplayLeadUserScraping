I\u2019ve been toying with getting a medium format camera for a couple years now. I owned a C330 for a few weeks a couple of years ago and didn\u2019t like the 6x6 format so I lost interest. However I have a new job and am again looking at medium formats. \n\nMy main question is is there a camera that will shoot a 645 back in landscape? I don\u2019t want to have my arm cocked weird for every shot and I don\u2019t really want to change my shooting style to fit a portrait orientation.\n\nIdeally I\u2019d like something like a Bronica or Mamiya 645 style system but I\u2019m keen on hearing if anyone here knows of anything that sounds like a good fit?\n\nThanks guys!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/7yuk3l/landscape_on_645/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "orientation", "selectorShort": "orientation", "MarkedSent": "landscape on 645? /!/ hi all. i\u2019ve been toying with getting a medium format camera for a couple years now. i owned a c330 for a few weeks a couple of years ago and didn\u2019t like the 6x6 format so i lost interest. however i have a new job and am again looking at medium formats. \n\nmy main question is is there a camera that will shoot a 645 back in landscape? i don\u2019t want to have my arm cocked weird for every shot and i don\u2019t really want to change my shooting style to fit a portrait -----> orientation !!! .\n\nideally i\u2019d like something like a bronica or mamiya 645 style system but i\u2019m keen on hearing if anyone here knows of anything that sounds like a good fit?\n\nthanks guys!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 19597, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 130772, "autor": "BeerHorse", "date": 1524984898000, "content": "Olympus mju II/Stylus Epic - why all the love? /!/ I recently acquired one of these as a hand-me-down - a mju II Zoom 80, to be precise.
