Since I usually use all my machines  holding them around my neck for safety, I started looking for a replacement. I learned quickly that the machine used a proprietary pressure heads that are currently no longer marketed: this obviously in theory restricts the use of only original shoulder straps which for this reason are sold used at very high prices. So I tried to understand if there could be a not too DIY alternative on the market. After a fairly intricate search for information, I decided to trust the few opinions found online and I bought the model B of OP/Tech USA pro connectors (those with a square hole to be clear) even if the model A is recommended on the manufacturer's website for Zenzas.\n\nThe hooks fit perfectly and are much safer than (at least to me) it seemed from the product photos. They consist of two parts: the first, that is the lower one, is the perforated one that must be inserted around the pin on the machine, while the second, that is the upper one, once positioned goes under the pin head to prevent it from accidentally coming out. To release the connector, it is just necessary to grab the two side tabs of the top and lift it, in order to free the head of the pin. To avoid unintentional lifting, just insert the plastic block that slides on the belt.\n\nSince I did not particularly trust the backpack-type buckle coupling (the machine, depending on the lens mounted, reaches about 2kg), instead of buying the complete kit with shoulder strap I bought these connectors and a standard shoulder strap without hooks. The belt of the connectors is wider than the one of normal shoulder straps, so it is possible as I did with a little imagination, to join the two pieces using the plastic loops and obtain a perfectly stable result. Alternatively, given that the connector belts are quite long if pulled to the maximum it is possible to join them using the included buckle and create a strap to be rolled for example around the wrist.\n\nI hope this can be useful for someone that is in my same situation.

My photographic journal, An Analog Odyssey, is about to publish its second physical edition this June and we're looking to expand our writer and photographer list. /!/ Hello everyone,  \n\n\nMy name is /u/the_steampunk or Patrick and I am the creator of a photographic journal called 'An Analog Odyssey' An Analog Odyssey is a [journal](https://www.nomadicaberrations.com/journal) published once a season as a physical print. This past March we published our first print edition ['Winter | 2021'](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/mce157/after_many_long_hours_and_late_nights_i_was_able/) and it was received quite well by the community here. A number of you reached out to me inquiring about being on future editions and so here we are. \n\nThe previous edition was just shy of 200 pages and had a ton of writing and photographs from creatives all around the globe and I hope to continue this trend with the spring edition. The sentiment or ethos of the journal is to document the human experience through the lens of film photography. In our last edition, we had journal entries on a wide variety of subjects ranging from drawing likeness to being an underground club DJ in Hong Kong to replacing memories of an ex-lover with new ones while going to the same places. The journal at its core acts as a community journal filled with photographs and writing from the heart. So if the subject matter is powerful enough to move you then it is likely appropriate for An Analog Odyssey.\n\nAs a full disclaimer, this is not a paid gig or position. This is a personal project that I put together for the love of the art. The journal generates very little money and as much as I would love to be able to pay everyone it isn't feasible for me to do so at this time. However, if you're interested in helping create a community project then please feel free to. As was the case with the last edition I sent copies of my magazine to photographers/writers who were on it who helped out the most. And at the very least I can offer all writers/photographers the magazine at the cost it cost for me to print. However, I just want to be upfront about this so that no one feels like they were misled. \n\nWe're planning on having our spring edition sent to our publisher by June 15th. This gives us a little more than a month to finish up this edition. If you're interested in submitting your writing and photographs for the journal please DM me with your email address here on Reddit or inquire in the comment section below.

Ultimately, I was drawn to the Olympus XA for a couple reasons. First, the aperture priority-only operation matched how I used my main film camera, the Nikon N80. Second, I'd never used a rangefinder and thought that was a cool feature for such a compact camera, and relatedly the idea of manual focus more generally seemed appealing because of my skepticism toward point and shoot AF systems. Third, the lens, both in reputation of quality and max 2.8 aperture both made it seem like a decent value relative to the going price. I paid \\~$120 for mine (sorry, more than $5, and not from a thrift store to boot).\n\nPros:\n\n* So compact (duh?). Not pocketable for me, but I certainly don't notice it while carrying around or dangling by the wrist strap\n* The lens lives up to its reputation. Definitely some vignetting at larger apertures (easy enough to fix in post if desired) but plenty sharp at f5.6 and beyond. For daytime shooting I pretty much keep it between f5.6 and f11.\n* Fast lens. with a max aperture of f2.8, combined with the lack of mirror, I have been able to shoot iso 200 film around sunset and into blue hour without too much worry.\n* Whisper quiet shutter. It's a small click, and that's it. Approaches silence with even just a bit of background noise.\n* Focus tab. The manual focus tab extends below the lens, allowing for a natural finger position to move it to the desired position. There's a nice distance indicator on top as well, for faster paced shooting with zone focus.\n* Manual film advance. Personally, I like this, as it reduces complexity and eliminates noise. If silence is paramount for your shooting situation, you can simply take your shot, step away, and advance the film.\n* Viewfinder shutter speed needle. I love that the shutter speed selected by the camera is displayed in the viewfinder, compared to the less informative 1, 2, or 3 light system used by many other fixed lens rangefinders or point and shoots.\n* Manual ISO/exposure comp. The ISO setting is readily accessible just above the focus tab, and it quickly came naturally to me to use it for exposure compensation. E.g., shooting Colorplus 200 in a high contrast scene, I will often move the ISO down to 100. It was as I was writing this section that I realized I'd never used the dedicated +1.5 backlight setting. Whoops! I've always gone to the ISO out of habit, I guess.\n* Metering accuracy. The meter is quite capable, though as a safeguard, I will preemptively add +1 exposure comp (see above) if I know I'll be shooting in higher contrast conditions.\n\nCons:\n\n* Inconsistent frame spacing. Something I've noticed (with my camera at least) is that compared to my N80, the frame spacing is much less predictable frame to frame. Small nit, but one nonetheless.\n* Rangefinder pet peeves. Depending on lighting, the rangefinder window can be dim to non-existent, sometimes necessitating pointing in a different direction and focusing on something similarly close as the intended subject.\n* The shutter button is flush. The shutter does not really protrude from the camera, and occasionally I will be forced to fumble around for it if my eye is up to the viewfinder.\n* Tight viewfinder. As a glasses wearer, I find myself looking around the viewfinder at different angles to assess framing (which I'm aware is an estimate, even for the best in class rangefinder viewfinders). Kind of annoying sometimes.\n* Sometimes too compact. Especially in the beginning, for shooting in portrait orientation I found the edge of my finger slipping into the very top of a handful of the frames. I've become more adept at holding the camera so my fingers are pulled up and out of the way, and not out in front of the lens.\n\nNote: I have never even tested the flash that came with it, so can't comment on that.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy using this camera. Despite its faults, it's generally a joy to use and has definitely satisfied my desire for an advanced point and shoot.

Tore it apart, learned about how cameras work kinda. Found the issue to be a stuck transport latch, moved it back and it worked!\n\n**The** **Backstory**\n\nI recently bought a Yashica Electro 35 GS and it was in good condition except for the fact that the film advance lever was [stuck all the way at the end of its range](https://i.imgur.com/DsbGLOR.jpg), right before it would normally release and go back to its original position. This was the first time I ever tried to repair anything so I didn't really have much of an idea of how the insides of the camera worked. \n\n**The Process**\n\nI watched a couple YouTube videos and took apart the top and bottom covers, hoping to see something stuck inside a gear that could easily be removed. No debris, but a few little fuzzy things that I think were bugs. I fiddled and fiddled until finally I called some local camera repair shops to see if they had any ideas. One of them said that it sounded like a shutter issue and offered to fix it for about $150. Considering I bought the thing for $45, that didn't sound too swell to me. I took apart the front of the lens, trying to be as careful as I could not to ruin anything. I finally got to the main part of the lens, [which you can see here](http://www.erikfiss.com/foto/cams/electro35/Yashica_Electro_35_Repair_Manual/slides/44.html) (that's the manual I used for most of the repair).\n\nOnce there, I cleaned off the shutter leaves and fiddled around with some of the parts to see what happened when I gently moved them. At this point, I thought the issue was that the shutter leaves were stuck closed like the repair guy had said. I let impatience and anarchy get the better of me when I decided to remove all those tiny little intricate pieces to get to the shutter leaves and see if I could unstick them. Boy, was that a mistake. I followed that manual's order for the teardown and took little care of remembering how things were and how they went. By the time I got to [page 107](http://www.erikfiss.com/foto/cams/electro35/Yashica_Electro_35_Repair_Manual/slides/107.html) of the manual, I started to wonder if that was even really the issue (after I had already taken off so much... facepalm). \n\nIt was getting late as well, so I decided I'd put it back together and man, those pieces are tiny! Over at least 20 tries per step of getting things back in order. Springs would pop off, things would go out of alignment, etc etc over and over and over again. Seriously, don't mess with these tiny parts unless you want to spend a few hours putting them back in place. I ended up breaking off the solder of one of the  switch assembly pieces (which I still have to fix if I want to use any other shutter speed than 1/500) but I managed to get all the other pieces back in order. Although I learned a TON about how that area of the camera worked, I was still back at square one.\n\nAs I was searching for solutions online, some guy recommended just smacking your camera with your palm to dislodge whatever is stuck. I figured what they hey might as well try it. I started smacking it around when a caveman lightbulb went off in my head. \"Why don't I just force it back?\" Okay, here goes nothing. Push, push, push and voila! It's back in place. Fire the shutter, wind it, and stuck again. Uhhh. Push, push, push and voila! It took quite a bit of effort to get it back and I sensed that this would be an issue, but I was glad to have made some progress. (In hindsight, don't force it open, you'll mess with the camera in a way I'll describe in a second).\n\n**The Repair**\n\nIt was the next morning and I was ready to tackle this thing. I took off the top and bottom plate again and started snooping around to see what was physically catching this lever and making it stop. At first I thought it could be something with the bottom gears but after a couple fiddles, no luck. Then I started looking at the winding mechanism and noticed something. Me forcing the lever back was actually [shearing the 2nd to last tooth on the gear that held it in place](https://i.imgur.com/toE6oYN.jpg). Hmmmmm. Why is it the 2nd to last tooth?  I fiddled with the lever and came to realize that the catcher part releases *after* going over the last tooth, but it was getting stuck before it could get there. I came around to the front and found the culprit, the dreaded *transport latch*. [Here's a picture](https://i.imgur.com/CH61wx4.jpg) of what mine looked like, and what it [was supposed to look like](https://i.imgur.com/vexwB1L.png). It's subtle, but if you stare long enough you'll see th difference. I noticed that it seemed stuck both under the winding mechanism and also between a metal post and the front wall of the camera. So, I stuck a tiny jeweler's flathead screwdriver under the post-side of the latch, leveraged it til it finally moved over the post and SNAP! Right back into place! All of a sudden, the advance lever unstuck itself and the [camera was working beautifully again](https://streamable.com/fiwrqc). \n\n**What I learned**\n\nTake your time, take pictures of how things were, don't take things apart unless you're prepared to spend a long time putting them back, and don't give up!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/mig2hy/how_i_fixed_my_yashica_electro_35_gss_stuck_film/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "how i fixed my yashica electro 35 gs's stuck film lever /!/ **tl;dr**\n\nbought a camera with a stuck film advance lever. tore it apart, learned about how cameras work kinda. found the issue to be a stuck transport latch, moved it back and it worked!\n\n**the** **backstory**\n\ni recently bought a yashica electro 35 gs and it was in good condition except for the fact that the film advance lever was [stuck all the way at the end of its range](https://i.imgur.com/dsbglor.jpg), right before it would normally release and go back to its original -----> position !!! . this was the first time i ever tried to repair anything so i didn't really have much of an idea of how the insides of the camera worked. \n\n**the process**\n\ni watched a couple youtube videos and took apart the top and bottom covers, hoping to see something stuck inside a gear that could easily be removed. no debris, but a few little fuzzy things that i think were bugs. i fiddled and fiddled until finally i called some local camera repair shops to see if they had any ideas. one of them said that it sounded like a shutter issue and offered to fix it for about $150. considering i bought the thing for $45, that didn't sound too swell to me. i took apart the front of the lens, trying to be as careful as i could not to ruin anything. i finally got to the main part of the lens, [which you can see here](http://www.erikfiss.com/foto/cams/electro35/yashica_electro_35_repair_manual/slides/44.html) (that's the manual i used for most of the repair).\n\nonce there, i cleaned off the shutter leaves and fiddled around with some of the parts to see what happened when i gently moved them. at this point, i thought the issue was that the shutter leaves were stuck closed like the repair guy had said. i let impatience and anarchy get the better of me when i decided to remove all those tiny little intricate pieces to get to the shutter leaves and see if i could unstick them. boy, was that a mistake. i followed that manual's order for the teardown and took little care of remembering how things were and how they went. by the time i got to [page 107](http://www.erikfiss.com/foto/cams/electro35/yashica_electro_35_repair_manual/slides/107.html) of the manual, i started to wonder if that was even really the issue (after i had already taken off so much... facepalm). \n\nit was getting late as well, so i decided i'd put it back together and man, those pieces are tiny! over at least 20 tries per step of getting things back in order. springs would pop off, things would go out of alignment, etc etc over and over and over again. seriously, don't mess with these tiny parts unless you want to spend a few hours putting them back in place. i ended up breaking off the solder of one of the  switch assembly pieces (which i still have to fix if i want to use any other shutter speed than 1/500) but i managed to get all the other pieces back in order. although i learned a ton about how that area of the camera worked, i was still back at square one.\n\nas i was searching for solutions online, some guy recommended just smacking your camera with your palm to dislodge whatever is stuck. i figured what they hey might as well try it. i started smacking it around when a caveman lightbulb went off in my head. \"why don't i just force it back?\" okay, here goes nothing. push, push, push and voila! it's back in place. fire the shutter, wind it, and stuck again. uhhh. push, push, push and voila! it took quite a bit of effort to get it back and i sensed that this would be an issue, but i was glad to have made some progress. (in hindsight, don't force it open, you'll mess with the camera in a way i'll describe in a second).\n\n**the repair**\n\nit was the next morning and i was ready to tackle this thing. i took off the top and bottom plate again and started snooping around to see what was physically catching this lever and making it stop. at first i thought it could be something with the bottom gears but after a couple fiddles, no luck. then i started looking at the winding mechanism and noticed something. me forcing the lever back was actually [shearing the 2nd to last tooth on the gear that held it in place](https://i.imgur.com/toe6oyn.jpg). hmmmmm. why is it the 2nd to last tooth?  i fiddled with the lever and came to realize that the catcher part releases *after* going over the last tooth, but it was getting stuck before it could get there. i came around to the front and found the culprit, the dreaded *transport latch*. [here's a picture](https://i.imgur.com/ch61wx4.jpg) of what mine looked like, and what it [was supposed to look like](https://i.imgur.com/vexwb1l.png). it's subtle, but if you stare long enough you'll see th difference. i noticed that it seemed stuck both under the winding mechanism and also between a metal post and the front wall of the camera. so, i stuck a tiny jeweler's flathead screwdriver under the post-side of the latch, leveraged it til it finally moved over the post and snap! right back into place! all of a sudden, the advance lever unstuck itself and the [camera was working beautifully again](https://streamable.com/fiwrqc). \n\n**what i learned**\n\ntake your time, take pictures of how things were, don't take things apart unless you're prepared to spend a long time putting them back, and don't give up!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 9932, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 264416, "autor": "Adorable-Tap-9763", "date": 1627895565000, "content": "Question about my Exa 1c with light shaft finder /!/ Recently, I got a film back from development which was almost completely out of focus.
