Problem with fast shutter? /!/ I decided to get into film photography as a hobby. So recently I got my hands on a Zorki 4 film camera and just got the photos from my second ever film roll. Sadly a lot of the photos have a black stripe or spot (? Really unsure how to describe it) on the side of the photo. The size of the 'stripe' varies though.  \nUnfortunately I don't know the settings I used (maybe I should write that down the next time), but it seems like the affected photos were shot at a faster shutter speed (either 1/1000 or 1/500), because photos I shot with a slower shutter speed in lower light seem to be completely fine.  \n  \n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/rBnn4EW) are some examples. \n\nSo could this problem be the faster shutter speed or maybe something else that I'm not familiar with?  \nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/bjfpwf/what_could_this_be_problem_with_fast_shutter/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "what could this be? problem with fast shutter? /!/ i decided to get into film photography as a hobby. so recently i got my hands on a zorki 4 film camera and just got the photos from my second ever film roll. sadly a lot of the photos have a black stripe or -----> spot !!!

I get great/decent results but I know that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s jam. \n\nSecondly I\u2019ve been really experimenting with Sunny 16. When I want a different aperture or shutter speed, I start at the base Sunny 16 reading for a scene and then move my dials to scale. So if in bright daylight my shutter speed is at 1/250 (rating 400iso at half box speed) and my aperture is f/16, then I can have an aperture of f/8 by moving the aperture down two stops and my shutter speed down two stops also.

I have shot probably around 20 rolls of film in the past 7 months or so and the cost of development and scanning is getting higher.  I'm currently shooting 35mm and polaroids, but would like to soon get into medium format and hopefully some day large format.  \n\nAt the local lab I go to they normally take about a week to process/scan and the cost is around $20 per roll.  I have only been doing normal scans but you can do .tifs for + $3, \"Max scans\" for +$5, and to get max tif scans it's +$10.  I've found that I don't always love their scans when I don't get the exposure quite right.  What I get are .jpgs that are 3089x2048.  The employees say that the scanner they have is not a drum scanner, but is a $500k Noritsu scanner.\n\nI'm getting to the point where I'd like to tweak scan settings and get more artistic control out of my photos as well as begin editing more than just adjusting the black and white point in Preview.  I'd also like to scan my polaroids but that's not a top priority.  \n\nMy main concern is getting a scanner that will give me better results than the scans I'm currently getting back from the lab without way overspending.  I literally have no idea what to spend.  People say that the Epson v800 flatbed scanners leave a lot to be desired, but those cost about $1k!  And the scanners people do recommend are only available used and from the 90s for even greater sums of money.  I want not only greater fidelity/resolution but also the artistic control that comes with scanning yourself.  \n\nI figured that scanning technology would be much further along than this, or at least cheaper.  I guess its just cuz low quality scans are ok for most other applications?  And film is just so dense with information that its an edge use case?  Did they stop making good scanners after the year 2000?  A little history would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you so much for reading all the way through this.  I just wanted to fully explain my situation and give an accurate view of where I'm at.  I just want to know where the sweet spot is so that I get quality but don't have to spend a ton of money.

So I prepared two examples that show different subjects that where scratched and dirty. But in addition I like to explain what the steps are to achieve this results so that some aspects could be applied to DSLR scanning or other techniques.\n\nTo see the differences better I recommend to see the image at full resolution. You can also download example 2 images at full resolution to be able to flick through the images for better comparison: [Download Example 2 Images (Full resolution)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i6xi6jbhl56kfi6/AACCG3PQtXJQf7uhWTbmpdMFa?dl=0) I also added the IR scan, flat field and dark frame in that shared folder to show how they look like.\n\nNow the technical part. Wall of text incoming :)\n\n# Scanner &amp; Scanning Software\n\nBoth Examples are scanned with a dedicated film scanner, the Minolta Multi Pro. For the scanning software I used Vuescan using the 64bit raw tiff capability that extracts the IR scan into the alpha channel of the scan. I think Silverfast is also capable of doing this for certain models but not my Minolta.\n\nBut in the past I also used an Epson 4990 which also worked pretty good. It only had aligning issues at times from the image to the IR scan, because it scans them in separate passes and the film might bulge in between due to the heat of the lamp.\n\n# Flat Field Correction\n\nOften this is done from scanner software directly and called \"calibrate scanner\" to even out the ccd sensor response and of the light source. But I had issues with the internal scanner software calibration from Vuescan that caused colored 1 pixel lines and other unusual shadows/color shades.  So I decided that this must be done manually on the raw scan to fix the issues.\n\nI used a technique that astro photographers are using to correct their photos that are often plagued with noise and other optical shades. You can read up details and the math behind it at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-field_correction). \n\nHere is a excerpt from my scanning working doc:\n\n\\------------------\n\n**! Important** \n\nSetup your crop area for your all your scans and leave it unchanged! Otherwise the calibration will not work as it should be.\n\n**Dark Frame (Fixed Pattern Noise = FPN)**\n\nUsed to correct the dark current noise and uneven response of the CCD pixels to remove stripes in the scans.\n\n* Scan frame with holder opening closed with same exposure and samples as the image that is about to be  scanned\n* Check the dark frame for light leaks. It should be flat without any brighter parts.\n* Resize image to a 1 pixel strip (along line sensor axis)  to get a footprint of the line sensor response. The resize to 1 pixel will interpolated (bicubic) so that the average is used later on.\n* Place the dark frame on the base image and resize it back to the size of the base image.\n* Subtract dark frame from base image\n\n**Flat Field (FF)**\n\nUsed to eliminate uneven illumination of the lamp and to correct dirt on the mirrors and sensor.\n\n* Set the exposure as high as possible without any clipping!\n* Dark frame is subtracted from the flat field\n* That flat-field 'image' is normalized by dividing the entire image by the brightest pixels of the FF image.\n* Divide base image with the flat field image.\n* Note: the IR channel must be flatfielded as well\n\n# IR Clean\n\nThe cleaning of the scan is done with the help of the IR scan (infra red) of the film. Infrared is capable to show defects as dark spots that help to mask them properly.\n\nHere is a excerpt from my scanning working doc:\n\n\\------------------ \n\n* Reduce visible image parts from the Infrared image by dividing it with the Red channel of the image. This must be done because the infrared sensor sees some of the visible color spectrum.\n* Further optimize IR image by reducing sensor noise with a noise reduction filter to be able to create better cleaning mask.\n* Create a mask from the IR image that will be used to clean the final image. \n* Clean up the final image with the mask using the content aware fill from Photoshop\n\n# Photoshop Action:\n\nIn the end I created several Photoshop actions that handles all the cleanup and correction process with one click.

( not liking the ideea, also i can get better resolution with a dslr ). ( maybe not the same density, but the scanner is a lot of money for something i do as a passion)\n2. shoot the same exact frame on 35mm, with the same settings, same film, and the greycard. shoot the 4x5 without greycard.  \"scan\" both films with the same settings, correct the 35mm frame with curves and greycard, apply curves to the 4x5 frame. would this work ? guess so.. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntl:dr : can\\`t white balance colour negatives right. need a way to do this scanning with a dslr.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 96828, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 94335, "autor": "alphakappafalloftroy", "date": 1554050880000, "content": "Film in Chicago? /!/ Anyone know where to go to buy rolls of film in Chicago?
