Before the jump, I tried to do some research about these two cameras, and found lots of fanboying for one or the other, making it hard to figure out what the real difference in quality, handling, etc. between the two cameras was. This is intended to help someone else trying to decide on making the jump to Hasselblad.\n\nTL;DR: Hasselblad is legendary for its image quality for a reason, but you can get a lot of the artistic benefits over a Mamiya C with a different Medium Format SLR.\n\nMamiya C22:\n\nPros:  \n\\- Cheap, but with really good interchangeable lenses  \n\\- Extremely reliable  \n\\- A great jump into MF that doesn't lock you into a single lens. IQ is better than pretty much anything 35mm.  \n\\- Easy to repair. Lenses and shutters are modular, so this system will be repairable for a long time.  \n\\- Extremely quiet, which is good for surreptitious shots.\n\nCons:  \n\\- Big and heavy. Built like a tank comes at a price  \n\\- No infinity stop. This is punishing for landscapes. Lots of pictures where the focus is just a touch off.  \n\\- Viewfinder is just OK.\n\nHasselblad 501C:\n\nPros:  \n\\- Zeiss image rendering is stunning. High micro-contrast with smooth out of focus gives stunning images. Shots are sharp corner to corner on 6x6.  \n\\- Interchangeable backs are artistically a game changer. The ability to look at a scene and pick one of several color or black and white film stocks is huge.  \n\\- Handling is significantly better than a TLR.  \n\\- Depth of Field preview is really handy for portraits, close up work, etc.  \n\\- Designed to be idiot proof. You can't take a picture if the dark slide is in, you can't remove the back if it's out, etc.\n\nCons:  \n\\- Hasselblad tax doesn't end at the camera and lenses. Backs, filters, lens caps, and straps are all more expensive.  \n\\- It is loud. Everyone looks at you when you hit the shutter button.\n\nGeneral impressions:\n\nLet me start by saying, if I had it to do over again, I would still absolutely have bought the Hasselblad. This is going to be my main shooter for a long time, and I love taking pictures with the thing. That said, not everyone is in a position to buy a Hasselblad.\n\nThe jump from 35mm to MF is a \"wow moment.\" I get more pictures I am happier with on MF than on 35mm. For making that jump, the Mamiya C is one of the best options going, due to its repairability and extremely solid IQ. Unfortunately, the limits on the system, particularly the lack of an infinity stop are critical.\n\nIf you look at the list of Pros for the Hasselblad, all but 1 can be had with a Mamiya 645 super, Mamiya RZ/RB67, or most of the Bronicas. All of these are going to have pros and cons of their own, but at the end of the day will get you interchangeable backs, better handling and depth of field preview. Both of the Mamiya systems even have some \"magic\" lenses of their own that cost about the same as a single every day Hasselblad lens.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you want to get crazy cool image quality and have the money, you can't beat a Hasselblad 500 series. However, if you want a tool that will give you more options artistically than a TLR while still getting the MF wow factor, you have lots of options that have more realistic price points than a Hasselblad.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I need to go sell a kidney so I can afford a wide angle lens and a split prism focusing screen for the 'blad. ;)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/dhcnbk/mamiya_c_vs_hasselblad_500_review/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "mamiya c vs hasselblad 500 review /!/ after shooting a mamiya c22 for about a year and a half, i had an opportunity to jump to a hasselblad 501c for a reasonable amount of money. before the jump, i tried to do some research about these two cameras, and found lots of fanboying for one or the other, making it hard to figure out what the real difference in quality, handling, etc. between the two cameras was. this is intended to help someone else trying to decide on making the jump to hasselblad.\n\ntl;dr: hasselblad is legendary for its image quality for a reason, but you can get a lot of the artistic benefits over a mamiya c with a different medium format slr.\n\nmamiya c22:\n\npros:  \n\\- cheap, but with really good interchangeable lenses  \n\\- extremely reliable  \n\\- a great jump into mf that doesn't lock you into a single lens. iq is better than pretty much anything 35mm.  \n\\- easy to repair. lenses and shutters are modular, so this system will be repairable for a long time.  \n\\- extremely quiet, which is good for surreptitious shots.\n\ncons:  \n\\- big and heavy. built like a tank comes at a price  \n\\- no infinity stop. this is punishing for landscapes. lots of pictures where the focus is just a touch off.  \n\\- viewfinder is just ok.\n\nhasselblad 501c:\n\npros:  \n\\- zeiss image rendering is stunning. high micro-contrast with smooth out of focus gives stunning images. shots are sharp corner to corner on 6x6.  \n\\- interchangeable backs are artistically a game changer. the ability to look at a scene and pick one of several color or black and white film stocks is huge.  \n\\- handling is significantly better than a tlr.  \n\\- depth of field preview is really handy for portraits, close up work, etc.  \n\\- designed to be idiot proof. you can't take a picture if the dark slide is in, you can't remove the back if it's out, etc.\n\ncons:  \n\\- hasselblad tax doesn't end at the camera and lenses. backs, filters, lens caps, and straps are all more expensive.  \n\\- it is loud. everyone looks at you when you hit the shutter button.\n\ngeneral impressions:\n\nlet me start by saying, if i had it to do over again, i would still absolutely have bought the hasselblad. this is going to be my main shooter for a long time, and i love taking pictures with the thing. that said, not everyone is in a -----> position !!!  to buy a hasselblad.\n\nthe jump from 35mm to mf is a \"wow moment.\" i get more pictures i am happier with on mf than on 35mm. for making that jump, the mamiya c is one of the best options going, due to its repairability and extremely solid iq. unfortunately, the limits on the system, particularly the lack of an infinity stop are critical.\n\nif you look at the list of pros for the hasselblad, all but 1 can be had with a mamiya 645 super, mamiya rz/rb67, or most of the bronicas. all of these are going to have pros and cons of their own, but at the end of the day will get you interchangeable backs, better handling and depth of field preview. both of the mamiya systems even have some \"magic\" lenses of their own that cost about the same as a single every day hasselblad lens.\n\nat the end of the day, if you want to get crazy cool image quality and have the money, you can't beat a hasselblad 500 series. however, if you want a tool that will give you more options artistically than a tlr while still getting the mf wow factor, you have lots of options that have more realistic price points than a hasselblad.\n\nnow if you will excuse me, i need to go sell a kidney so i can afford a wide angle lens and a split prism focusing screen for the 'blad. ;)", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 94012, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 91844, "autor": "Ciolloi", "date": 1562451074000, "content": "Minolta AF 9000 sutter mirror problem /!/ Hi, I have a Minolta 9000 that has grise on the curtain.

I've been using it exclusively on an F3 before but I mounted it on my D800 today and noticed that the aperture selected on the ring isn't the same as what the camera thinks it is. It's shifted by one stop. When selecting f/5.6 for example, the camera displays f/8. The metering seems to be fine, as it reports the same SS as using a G lens with no ring.\n\nThis sparked my interest and I compared the aperture rings between the 50mm and my Zeiss 28mm 2.0 ZF. I realize that the tab that interacts with the camera to tell the latter the position of the ring is not aligned the same way on the two lenses.
