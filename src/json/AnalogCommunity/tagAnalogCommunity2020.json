Don't feel like you *have to* stick to them, they're just creative constraints for an extra challenge\n\nAnd there's only one rule \u2014 photos must be taken on film.

There are so many of these accounts that it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell them apart, so part of why I wanted to write this is to help demystify their differences. \n\nSome of these accounts are legitimate print outlets, though some of them just exist on Instagram. Some of them \u2013 particularly the larger accounts \u2013 may not rely on hashtags for discovering work at all, even though it seems like they do. Your mileage may vary, and to be honest, it\u2019s sometimes a popularity contest, especially with accounts that have more than 200k followers. But other photographers may follow these hashtags and discover your work as a result. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of crossover with these accounts. You\u2019ll see certain photos and photographers that are featured on multiple accounts, which is I guess the film photography version of going viral. You know the kind of photos I\u2019m talking about \u2013 the kind that are peppered throughout Instagram\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section, or the ones that hit the top of r/analog. The kind that win contests. The ones that make you wish that you too were a master of nailing exposure and stumbling across (or creating) scenes that take your breath away.\n\nAnyways, here\u2019s a rough guide to curated feature accounts, sorted by the size of their follower-base. Instagram pages are linked. As a disclaimer, I think that curation is more important than popularity, and some of the smaller ones are run by people who are more involved in the analog community. Most of them are focused on film photography, but they\u2019re not all exclusively analog. Some featured photos just have a film \u201cvibe\u201d or aesthetic, which may annoy some people here. Lastly, these are just my opinions. This is a subjective guide. I'm not an expert -- I'm just a fan. \n\nOne thing I want to say is that you should **NEVER PAY FOR FEATURES**. I know it's tempting, everybody wants to get their work seen, but these accounts are popular because of other people's work. If anything, they should pay YOU for the use of your photography. I haven't mentioned certain accounts here because of this. \n\nAnyways...\n\n**\\~ \\~ A LIST OF FILM PHOTOGRAPHY FEATURE ACCOUNTS \\~ \\~**\n\n[**Somewhere Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/somewheremagazine/) **(#somewheremagazine) (861k followers)**\n\nSomewhere Magazine is one of the larger accounts out there. There\u2019s a nice mixture of cinematic scenes and more abstract lens-based art on this page, and it lives up to its claim of being a \u201cmood board\u201d.\n\n[**Film Wave**](https://www.instagram.com/film.wave/) **(#filmwave) (275k)** \n\nThis account has a tendency to post photos that are in some ways related to the act of analog photography in a meta kind of way. You\u2019ll find analog self portraits, photos of cameras, etc. on here. There\u2019s obviously more to their curation than that, as it is a large account with a large fanbase, but if you have a beautifully shot gear pic, this might be the account for you to tag. \n\n[**Nowhere Diary**](https://www.instagram.com/nowherediary/) **(#nowherediary) (257k)**\n\nLots of night scenes and foggy, moody photography. Lots of beautiful, empty scenes with no people in them, though some photos do feature people. What I like about this account is their tendency to pair some of their posts with lengthy written blurbs about photography. They have a series of Nowhere Diary Legend posts where they introduce their audience to famous photographers, which is a cool way to find out about significant photographers if you\u2019re new to photography and/or less plugged in to the historical side of things. \n\n[**Film Photographic**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotographic/) **(#filmphotographic) (204k)**\n\nOne of the founders and curators is Jason Lee, which is cool. Also a gallery and book publisher. There\u2019s an emphasis on more rural scenes here and landscapes. Many of the photos are people-less, which I like. I\u2019m not sure how active it is, but it\u2019s maybe worth checking out.\n\n[**If You Leave**](https://www.instagram.com/ifyouleavestagram/) **(#ifyouleave) (152k)**\n\nBig M O O D. Cinematic pics out the wazoo. Even the name is dramatic. This account has been around since 2009, before certain film cameras started costing more than cars. I like their curation.\n\n[**Film Photo Mag**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotomag/) **(#filmphotomag) (137k)** \n\nThere seems to be an emphasis on grainy photos on this page, some of which are underexposed (but who cares!). Moody stuff. Lots of cities, lots of silhouettes. That kind of thing. \n\n[**Tainted Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/taintedmag/) **(#taintedmag) (9k)**\n\nLots of fine art portraiture, sometimes of famous people. The curation seems to favor innovative poses and composition that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a fancy MFA program. Think Ryan McGinley, or someone whose work is more abstract than that. The photos here look like they could be in NY Mag or the NYT magazine. Or a museum, really. \n\n[**Film Shooters Collective**](https://www.instagram.com/filmshooterscollective/) **(#heyfsc) (80k)** \n\nThis account has been around for quite some time, and you\u2019ll notice that some of their curation highlights photos that embrace the imperfections of film. By this, I mean photos shot on expired film, or photos with light leaks. If you like double exposures, this might be a good hashtag for you to use. \n\n[**Photo Filmy**](https://www.instagram.com/photo.filmy/) **(#photofilmy) (74k)**\n\nThere tends to be a focus on geometrically-pleasing images here. Lots of beautiful old buildings, some Americana-influenced stuff. There\u2019s an interesting mix of curation here, and a number of the photos are densely layered. \n\n[**Ain't\u2013Bad**](https://www.instagram.com/aintbad/)  **(#aintbad)  (70k)** \n\nThis is less of a feature account and more of a real-assed magazine/publisher. There\u2019s more of an emphasis here on body of work (photo essays, photo books) than singles, which I really like because a cohesive body of work is what eventually sets you apart from the kind of photographers who just take pretty pictures. \n\n*NOTE: I found out after writing this that there are some* ***serious underlying issues with Ain\u2019t Bad****, which you can find out about on Instagram. Notably, they have failed to support people of color and lack diversity in their programming. There are also accusations of sexual assault that have been brought up against people involved with Ain\u2019t Bad. It\u2019s* ***really*** *disappointing and disheartening to read about because I\u2019ve found some great photographers through their site. Consider not using this hashtag.* \n\n[**Back 2 the Base**](https://www.instagram.com/back2thebase/) **(#back2thebase) (44k)** \n\nA mixture of Ian Howorth-esque emptiness, portraiture, and street photography. Quite artsy. I like their logo. \n\n[**Drive By Film**](https://www.instagram.com/drivebyfilm/) **(#drivebyfilm) (31k)** \n\nSpoiler alert: there are a lot of beautiful cars on this account\u2019s page, along with some gas stations, and a little bit of night work. It seems to be very focused on American scenes, though to be fair, so are many other accounts. \n\n[**Restore from Backup**](https://www.instagram.com/restorefrombackup/) **(#restorefrombackup) (31k)** \n\nI\u2019m biased in my love for this account because they\u2019ve shared my photography on multiple occasions (and more than other feature accounts have), but they place a really high value on community-building, and in that way it\u2019s like a mixture of r/analog and r/analogcommunity. From what I can tell it\u2019s run by good people who don\u2019t have a superiority complex about photography. They also do a nice job of showcasing work from smaller accounts. \n\n[**Burbs on Film**](https://www.instagram.com/burbsonfilm/) **(#burbsonfilm) (26k)**\n\nThere are plenty of photos of suburbs on this page, but they\u2019re not exclusively shot in suburban settings. A number of these photographs subvert traditional stereotypes of the United States, though some are pretty straightforward in their scope. Lots of these photos feel like they\u2019re from another era.\n\n[**Make Me See Mag**](https://www.instagram.com/makemeseemag/) **(#makemeseemag) (24k)** \n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed with the photos that this account features is that they mostly feature photographs that have a dynamic subject that your eye zeroes in on immediately. There\u2019s a little bit of flash photography thrown into the mix, which is nice. The curation is pretty varied and some of the photos are shot in quite innovative ways. It\u2019s a great account that deserves a larger following. \n\n[**The Film Stead**](https://www.instagram.com/thefilmstead/) **(#thefilmstead) (11k)** \n\nSoothing, beautiful photography with a focus on architecture and landscapes. In a world where so many photographs are moody and dark, it\u2019s nice to see photos that have a happier, more positive vibe.\n\n\\-----\n\n**Accounts with less than 10k followers that might be worth your time:** \n\n[**Every Day Rural America**](https://www.instagram.com/everydayruralamerica/) **(#everydayruralamerica) (6k)**\n\n[**Rural Exposures**](https://www.instagram.com/ruralexposures/) **(#ruralexposures) (6k)**\n\n[**The Film Renaissance**](https://www.instagram.com/thefilmrenaissance/) **(#thefilmrenaissance) (5k)**\n\n[**Film Leaders**](https://www.instagram.com/filmleaders/) **(#filmleaders) (4k)**\n\n[**Observation Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/observationmag/) **(#observationmag) (3k)**\n\n[**Seasoned Film**](https://www.instagram.com/seasonedfilm/) **(#seasonedfilm) (2k)** \n\n[**Analog Drive**](https://www.instagram.com/analogdrive/) **(#analogdrivemag) (1.5k)**\n\nFeel free to post more accounts that you like in the comments, or share your thoughts on these accounts.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not involved with running any of these accounts.

I love r/analogcommunity and I hope this helps somebody out.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ghmxxr/a_guide_to_film_photography_feature_accounts_on/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": true, "Selector": "tagged", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "a guide to film photography feature accounts on instagram /!/ this list is in no way meant to be exhaustive, as that would be impossible, but for those of you who are starting out with film photography and wondering how to share your work, there are a number of accounts that have their own hashtags, and mostly feature photos that are -----> tagged !!!  with those hashtags. there are so many of these accounts that it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell them apart, so part of why i wanted to write this is to help demystify their differences. \n\nsome of these accounts are legitimate print outlets, though some of them just exist on instagram. some of them \u2013 particularly the larger accounts \u2013 may not rely on hashtags for discovering work at all, even though it seems like they do. your mileage may vary, and to be honest, it\u2019s sometimes a popularity contest, especially with accounts that have more than 200k followers. but other photographers may follow these hashtags and discover your work as a result. \n\nthere\u2019s a lot of crossover with these accounts. you\u2019ll see certain photos and photographers that are featured on multiple accounts, which is i guess the film photography version of going viral. you know the kind of photos i\u2019m talking about \u2013 the kind that are peppered throughout instagram\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section, or the ones that hit the top of r/analog. the kind that win contests. the ones that make you wish that you too were a master of nailing exposure and stumbling across (or creating) scenes that take your breath away.\n\nanyways, here\u2019s a rough guide to curated feature accounts, sorted by the size of their follower-base. instagram pages are linked. as a disclaimer, i think that curation is more important than popularity, and some of the smaller ones are run by people who are more involved in the analog community. most of them are focused on film photography, but they\u2019re not all exclusively analog. some featured photos just have a film \u201cvibe\u201d or aesthetic, which may annoy some people here. lastly, these are just my opinions. this is a subjective guide. i'm not an expert -- i'm just a fan. \n\none thing i want to say is that you should **never pay for features**. i know it's tempting, everybody wants to get their work seen, but these accounts are popular because of other people's work. if anything, they should pay you for the use of your photography. i haven't mentioned certain accounts here because of this. \n\nanyways...\n\n**\\~ \\~ a list of film photography feature accounts \\~ \\~**\n\n[**somewhere magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/somewheremagazine/) **(#somewheremagazine) (861k followers)**\n\nsomewhere magazine is one of the larger accounts out there. there\u2019s a nice mixture of cinematic scenes and more abstract lens-based art on this page, and it lives up to its claim of being a \u201cmood board\u201d.\n\n[**film wave**](https://www.instagram.com/film.wave/) **(#filmwave) (275k)** \n\nthis account has a tendency to post photos that are in some ways related to the act of analog photography in a meta kind of way. you\u2019ll find analog self portraits, photos of cameras, etc. on here. there\u2019s obviously more to their curation than that, as it is a large account with a large fanbase, but if you have a beautifully shot gear pic, this might be the account for you to tag. \n\n[**nowhere diary**](https://www.instagram.com/nowherediary/) **(#nowherediary) (257k)**\n\nlots of night scenes and foggy, moody photography. lots of beautiful, empty scenes with no people in them, though some photos do feature people. what i like about this account is their tendency to pair some of their posts with lengthy written blurbs about photography. they have a series of nowhere diary legend posts where they introduce their audience to famous photographers, which is a cool way to find out about significant photographers if you\u2019re new to photography and/or less plugged in to the historical side of things. \n\n[**film photographic**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotographic/) **(#filmphotographic) (204k)**\n\none of the founders and curators is jason lee, which is cool. also a gallery and book publisher. there\u2019s an emphasis on more rural scenes here and landscapes. many of the photos are people-less, which i like. i\u2019m not sure how active it is, but it\u2019s maybe worth checking out.\n\n[**if you leave**](https://www.instagram.com/ifyouleavestagram/) **(#ifyouleave) (152k)**\n\nbig m o o d. cinematic pics out the wazoo. even the name is dramatic. this account has been around since 2009, before certain film cameras started costing more than cars. i like their curation.\n\n[**film photo mag**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotomag/) **(#filmphotomag) (137k)** \n\nthere seems to be an emphasis on grainy photos on this page, some of which are underexposed (but who cares!). moody stuff. lots of cities, lots of silhouettes. that kind of thing. \n\n[**tainted magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/taintedmag/) **(#taintedmag) (9k)**\n\nlots of fine art portraiture, sometimes of famous people. the curation seems to favor innovative poses and composition that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a fancy mfa program. think ryan mcginley, or someone whose work is more abstract than that. the photos here look like they could be in ny mag or the nyt magazine. or a museum, really. \n\n[**film shooters collective**](https://www.instagram.com/filmshooterscollective/) **(#heyfsc) (80k)** \n\nthis account has been around for quite some time, and you\u2019ll notice that some of their curation highlights photos that embrace the imperfections of film. by this, i mean photos shot on expired film, or photos with light leaks. if you like double exposures, this might be a good hashtag for you to use. \n\n[**photo filmy**](https://www.instagram.com/photo.filmy/) **(#photofilmy) (74k)**\n\nthere tends to be a focus on geometrically-pleasing images here. lots of beautiful old buildings, some americana-influenced stuff. there\u2019s an interesting mix of curation here, and a number of the photos are densely layered. \n\n[**ain't\u2013bad**](https://www.instagram.com/aintbad/)  **(#aintbad)  (70k)** \n\nthis is less of a feature account and more of a real-assed magazine/publisher. there\u2019s more of an emphasis here on body of work (photo essays, photo books) than singles, which i really like because a cohesive body of work is what eventually sets you apart from the kind of photographers who just take pretty pictures. \n\n*note: i found out after writing this that there are some* ***serious underlying issues with ain\u2019t bad****, which you can find out about on instagram. notably, they have failed to support people of color and lack diversity in their programming. there are also accusations of sexual assault that have been brought up against people involved with ain\u2019t bad. it\u2019s* ***really*** *disappointing and disheartening to read about because i\u2019ve found some great photographers through their site. consider not using this hashtag.* \n\n[**back 2 the base**](https://www.instagram.com/back2thebase/) **(#back2thebase) (44k)** \n\na mixture of ian howorth-esque emptiness, portraiture, and street photography. quite artsy. i like their logo. \n\n[**drive by film**](https://www.instagram.com/drivebyfilm/) **(#drivebyfilm) (31k)** \n\nspoiler alert: there are a lot of beautiful cars on this account\u2019s page, along with some gas stations, and a little bit of night work. it seems to be very focused on american scenes, though to be fair, so are many other accounts. \n\n[**restore from backup**](https://www.instagram.com/restorefrombackup/) **(#restorefrombackup) (31k)** \n\ni\u2019m biased in my love for this account because they\u2019ve shared my photography on multiple occasions (and more than other feature accounts have), but they place a really high value on community-building, and in that way it\u2019s like a mixture of r/analog and r/analogcommunity. from what i can tell it\u2019s run by good people who don\u2019t have a superiority complex about photography. they also do a nice job of showcasing work from smaller accounts. \n\n[**burbs on film**](https://www.instagram.com/burbsonfilm/) **(#burbsonfilm) (26k)**\n\nthere are plenty of photos of suburbs on this page, but they\u2019re not exclusively shot in suburban settings. a number of these photographs subvert traditional stereotypes of the united states, though some are pretty straightforward in their scope. lots of these photos feel like they\u2019re from another era.\n\n[**make

vibe.\n\n\\-----\n\n**accounts with less than 10k followers that might be worth your time:** \n\n[**every day rural america**](https://www.instagram.com/everydayruralamerica/)
