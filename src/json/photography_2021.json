As you may have recalled, [I wrote a piece last month on Milky Way photograpghy basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/lwucza/milky_way_core_season_is_right_around_the_corner/). Today I am going to continue this series and tell you about a game changing technique that you have probably maybe have already heard about. It is known as \u201cimage stacking.\u201d The idea is to take several images over time out in the field and then use processing software later on to reduce the noise as a result of a darker, higher ISO image. **This tutorial uses a program called StarryLandscapeStacker. It is a paid Mac app**. *Rest assured, a Windoge version is coming soon, as is a version to do this in Photoshop*. **Plus, the most important part of stacking starts with getting it right when shooting.**\n\nTake a look at [this example of a 1:1 crop of what an image looks like before and after stacking.](https://i.imgur.com/lBqJKsT.jpg)\n\nThe technique requires more work, but as you can see the results speak for themselves. Some phones even have sophisticated programming to compute this process for you. Stacking is becoming more common with computational photography today, but it has been around since the film days of astrophotography. \n\nFirst of all, if you have not done so already, please [read my post](https://danieljstein.com/tutorials/milkywaybasics) on how to find and shoot the Milky Way to familiarize yourself with the techniques we will be discussing here. (Oh yeah and pls shoot RAW ok) Now, let\u2019s move onto stacking, from start to finish. I will first be going over the core basics and describing parts of the process, then I will put everything altogether and summarize. Here we go00oo0000ooo:\n\n# Planning:\n\nStacking requires you stick to a shot for a few minutes. In other words, with single exposures, you can shoot one composition and move on to another immediately thereafter. But with stacking, you will need to setup your shot and shoot several exposures of it over time. This means leaving your camera in the same position for minutes at a time. It\u2019s like standing in a line at a coffee shop or something.\n\nYou will really want to make sure you nail your composition before you begin this process, so take a few quick test shots before shooting your stack sequence to ensure you will be happy with the outcome. These don\u2019t need to be long, just a few seconds with a ridiculously high ISO to understand your framing will do. Like crank it up to sandpaper levels and just do a 3 second shot.\n\nYou may have seen or heard of something called an \u201c[intervalometer](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?InitialSearch=yes&amp;N=0&amp;Ntt=intervalometer&amp;sts=ma).\u201d Complicated fancy word I know, but basically this is just a programmable remote that can control your camera\u2019s shutter. They come in all different shapes and sizes. #realintervalometershavecurves Some cameras today even have this built in. Having one of these will greatly assist in this process.\n\nIf your camera has a built-in intervalometer, it is best if you familiarize yourself with this function prior to shooting your stack. Most Canon\u2019s and Nikon\u2019s have this built-in, as well as some Sony\u2019s (I think?). They all operate differently, so I suggest you consult your camera\u2019s manual or some YouTuber tutorials on how to use yours.\n\nI personally still prefer using an external intervalometer. I feel like the interface is a lot easier to control my camera versus the built-in ones. Plus, I can always see how many more shots are left in the stack. But, no pressure to get one of these if you have the function built in, use what makes you feel the most comfortable. If your camera does not have a built-in intervalometer however, I really do highly recommend getting one as it will make shooting stacks fully automated. Doing this process manually can be annoying af.\n\n# Calculating how many shots you need\n\nThe more shots you take, the cleaner the output stacked image will be. But, there is a point where diminishing returns kicks in. To keep things simple for this post though, I do not think that is something to worry about. Focus on shooting anywhere between 2 minutes to 30 minutes worth of shots, depending on what and how you are shooting.\n\nUse your intervalometer to figure out how long the sequence will take.  So let\u2019s say according to the [NPF Rule](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/advanced-astrophotography-shutter-time-calculator/) you are going to have a 15 second shutter speed at f/2.8 and ISO 3200. If you dial in that you want 7 shots with a 1 second interval in between, that would be 112 seconds spend shooting. That is a pretty good chunk of data, but you can still get some more and get an even cleaner shot.\n\n**A few hot notes:** \n\n* Like I said, the more shots you get the better. If you find you are using a higher ISO like 6400 and above, it would be wise to get more shots.\n* If you are pressed for time in any way. For example clouds are rolling in, you gotta leave, you want to take other shots, you sandwich is getting cold, etc. then shoot less.\n* The tradeoff of shooting more shots is less noise and thus more detail.\n* If I personally am stacking I will usually go for 10-30 minutes of data for my nightscapes. Deep space is whole other ball game. For the purposes of this tut, we are focusing on nightscapes and the Milky Way with a wider lens.\n\nOnce you have toyed around with your intervalometer, shoot! Let the technology do the work for you. Set it and forget it. This is where not having the intervalometer will be dingly, because you will need to trigger the camera manually for each shot. \n\n### Now the biggy, programming your camera to shoot!!!1111!!!111!!1!11011001!!!!\n\nThere are two ways to do this as discussed. Either use your external intervalometer or your cameras built-in one. I will go over both, but just know that many intervalometers and cameras work differently. This is intended to be a guideline and the methods discussed here may not directly correlate to your setup. However, the concepts are very similar between cameras and remotes and this should help give you an idea of how to program. \n\n### Method 1: external remote:\n\n1. [Plug in your remote and set your camera to bulb mode](https://i.imgur.com/rQMkmoj.jpg). We want to give all shutter control to the remote.\n2. **Ensure long exposure noise reduction and self-timer are both off.**\n3. Dial in your other settings, such as ISO, aperture, white balance, and make sure your lens is in focus.\n4. Head over to your remote and power it on. [The first screen may indicate a delay.](https://i.imgur.com/bKeToa9.jpg) We do not need that for this so make sure everything shows a \u201c0.\u201d\n5. [The next screen](https://i.imgur.com/SjHtrZT.jpg)may show as \u201clong\u201d like my dog. He is long. This is your shutter speed. Dial it in according to the NPF rule.\n6. [The following is the interval.](https://i.imgur.com/VEnFq0Y.jpg) This is the duration between each shot. We want this as short as possible for easier processing. I set mine to \u201c01\u201d for 1 second.\n7. [The final screen is marked as \u201cn.\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/W43uaLq.jpg) This is the number of shots to do. I will do 20 for this round, giving me a total of 100 seconds of data. Eh, should probably do more.\n8. Press start and sit back while the technology does the work for you. \n\n### Method 2: Built-In\n\n1. Built-in intervalometers work a little differently to external. We want the camera to have full control here, so first step is to dial in your shutter speed.\u00a0\n2. **Ensure long exposure noise reduction and self-timer are both off.**\n3. [Then dial in all your other settings, again ensure you are in focus.](https://i.imgur.com/So2MHhk.jpg)\n4. [Navigate to where the interval timer function is in you camera.](https://i.imgur.com/QOabPly.jpg)\n5. Make sure the time is set to[the time now](https://i.imgur.com/eEGnOG1.jpg)if your camera has that option. \n6. [Programming the interval is a bit different here](https://i.imgur.com/sABGQ2t.jpg). Unlike with the remote where the shutter speed was separate from the time between each shot, here it is integrated and can be a little confusing. In other words, my shutter speed is 5 seconds, but I sill want a 1 second interval beteen each shot. This means the total interval needs to be set to \u201c6 seconds\u201d\n7. [Set the number of shots to do, in my case again, 20.](https://i.imgur.com/EQqi714.jpg)\n\n# Processing\n\nAfter the shoot it is time to process. I mean yeah that is normally how it works but you get what I mean. There are loads of different pieces of free and paid stacking softwares out there. I personally use StarryLandscapeStacker (SLS), which is a **paid Mac application**. I will be creating an additional tutorial to use the Windoge free equivalent, Sequator as well. Both pieces of software are very similar however so if you have a basic understanding of a processing workflow you may be able to easily transfer this tutorial over to that one.\n\n1. First, we need to catalog everything in Lightroom or another similar raw image processor. While SLS can read RAW files, it is often easier to make some minor adjustments in something like LR or CaptureOne prior to loading into SLS.\n2. According to the SLS user guide, it is best to lower the contrast all the way, as well as turn off any sort of lens and vignette corrections. You also need to turn off noise reduction and sharpening. **My take:** Turn off sharpening and noise reduction, yes. But as far as contrast goes I find that sometimes dropping it down all the way and then trying to add it back in again later creates strange artifacts in the image. I would just leave this at 0. For lens corrections, your mileage may vary. Sometimes I get unwanted results with them on, sometimes with them off. You will need to experiment with this. I would first start with them **off.**\n3. I would also lower your highlights a bit and bump up the shadows a bit. I would adjust the exposure here as well if your image is too bright or too dark. **Do not** add any sort of clarity/texture/saturation adjustments however.\n4. Select all your images and apply your adjustments. \n5. Export as 16 bit TIFFs in the ProphotoRGB color space. **Do not resize your images!** Below are my export settings. If I were you, group your set of shots in a folder. This makes file management much easier to work with.\n6. Once complete, open up StarryLandscapeStacker and it will automatically prompt you to import your images. Locate the folder you made in the previous step and let em rip.\n7. SLS will automatically analyze your shots. If it detects any discrepancies, it will prompt you. It may ask you to select dark/light/flat frames. Don\u2019t worry about these for now. Everything here is considered a \u201clight\u201d frame. I will talk about these other frames in a future tut.\n8. Once complete, you will notice red dottts all over your image. Red dots are what SLS uses to determine where the sky is and isn\u2019t. With that in mind, you need to erase red dots where they are present in the foreground. Do this by clicking \u201cerase red dots\u201d over on the left. Wild, I know.\n9. The next thing that needs to be done in order for the software to work properly is some red dots actually need to be drawn back in following the horizon. Do so by clicking add red dots on the left. Draw your dots following your horizon line. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. What we are doing here is telling the software where the foreground stops and the sky begins. This will improve how it aligns and stacks your images.\n10. Now it is time to make the sky mask. Click the \u201cFind Sky\u201d button on the left and watch SLS do magic.\n11. The mask will most likely not be clean right outta the box, so it needs to be cleaned up. At this point, we need to use the blue paint to make sure the entire sky is covered. Likewise, the ground needs to be completely blue free. Eifel 65 would not be proud of the ground. The sky on the other hand\u2026\n12. If you are familiar with Photoshop, the brush works similarly to the one found in there. You can use the brackets to increase or decrease the brush size. You can also increase or decrease the opacity of the blue overlay if that helps you clean up the mask.\n13. In the end, only the sky should be blue. Try your best to clean up the horizon. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect (unlike my dog, who is perfect), there just needs to be absolutely no blue in the foreground. If you are not sure if you missed a spot, crank up the opacity of the blue. Missed a spot.\n14. Once the mask is ready to rave, mash that \u201cAlign and Composite\u201d button on the left and let the show begin.\n15. At this point, SLS has used the mask to create two different photos which have been seamlessly blended together. The first is the sky photo, which has been aligned using the stars in each photo. Since the stars move relative to the Earth\u2019s rotation, they need to be aligned.\n16. The second image is the foreground which does not move. There is no need to align these images. Doing so relative to the star layer would actually cause it to be blurred. Thus, it is stacked separately.\n17. There is a lot going on in the background of this software. In my opinion I feel like it is crazy how quick and effective it is. 2021 man. (altho pretty sure this joint came out in 2014)\n18. At this point, the software presents several algorithms you can choose from over on the left. If you hover over them, you will find a brief explanation of what they do. Play around with these and see which algo fits your image best. **My take:** I have had the best results with \u201cMean Min Horizon Noise,\u201d and \u201cMean Min Horizon Star Dupe.\u201d Again play around with these, your mileage may vary.\n19. Use the \u201cZ\u201d key to zoom in 100% while messing with these. This can help determine which one works best.\n20. Once complete, press \u201cSave the Current\u201d image. You can also save the mask you created with the blue paint. This can be helpful if you are masking in a different foreground image, for example if you took a blue hour foreground shot.\n21. Images will be saved as a 16-bit TIFF. Once you are done, continue with your edits by importing in an image editor of your choice.\n\n# Let\u2019s Recap\n\nOkay so here is what we learned in boating school today kids. \n\n1. Plan out your shot by taking quick test compositions of what you want to shoot.\n2. Figure out how long it is going to take to shoot your stack. The more shots you shoot, the cleaner your image will be, but the longer it will take.\n3. Use an external intervalometer or your camera\u2019s built-in function to take your shots.\n4. Once you get back to your computer, apply the same edits to each RAW file and export.\n5. Open the files in StarryLandscapeStacker and let it work its magic.\n6. Erase the dots in your foreground, and add dots in your sky and horizon where applicable.\n7. Find the sky and refine the mask with your brush, ensuring nothing in your foreground is painted.\n8. Composite your image and select an algorithm that works best for your shot.\n9. Save your image and enjoy an astro image that has significantly less noise than a single exposure.

It is a paid Mac app**. *Rest assured, a Windoge version is coming soon, as is a version to do this in Photoshop*. **Plus, the most important part of stacking starts with getting it right when shooting.**\n\nTake a look at [this example of a 1:1 crop of what an image looks like before and after stacking.](https://i.imgur.com/lBqJKsT.jpg)\n\nThe technique requires more work, but as you can see the results speak for themselves. Some phones even have sophisticated programming to compute this process for you. Stacking is becoming more common with computational photography today, but it has been around since the film days of astrophotography. \n\nFirst of all, if you have not done so already, please [read my post](https://danieljstein.com/tutorials/milkywaybasics) on how to find and shoot the Milky Way to familiarize yourself with the techniques we will be discussing here. (Oh yeah and pls shoot RAW ok) Now, let\u2019s move onto stacking, from start to finish. I will first be going over the core basics and describing parts of the process, then I will put everything altogether and summarize. Here we go00oo0000ooo:\n\n# Planning:\n\nStacking requires you stick to a shot for a few minutes. In other words, with single exposures, you can shoot one composition and move on to another immediately thereafter. But with stacking, you will need to setup your shot and shoot several exposures of it over time. This means leaving your camera in the same position for minutes at a time. It\u2019s like standing in a line at a coffee shop or something.\n\nYou will really want to make sure you nail your composition before you begin this process, so take a few quick test shots before shooting your stack sequence to ensure you will be happy with the outcome. These don\u2019t need to be long, just a few seconds with a ridiculously high ISO to understand your framing will do. Like crank it up to sandpaper levels and just do a 3 second shot.\n\nYou may have seen or heard of something called an \u201c[intervalometer](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?InitialSearch=yes&amp;N=0&amp;Ntt=intervalometer&amp;sts=ma).\u201d Complicated fancy word I know, but basically this is just a programmable remote that can control your camera\u2019s shutter. They come in all different shapes and sizes. #realintervalometershavecurves Some cameras today even have this built in. Having one of these will greatly assist in this process.\n\nIf your camera has a built-in intervalometer, it is best if you familiarize yourself with this function prior to shooting your stack. Most Canon\u2019s and Nikon\u2019s have this built-in, as well as some Sony\u2019s (I think?). They all operate differently, so I suggest you consult your camera\u2019s manual or some YouTuber tutorials on how to use yours.\n\nI personally still prefer using an external intervalometer. I feel like the interface is a lot easier to control my camera versus the built-in ones. Plus, I can always see how many more shots are left in the stack. But, no pressure to get one of these if you have the function built in, use what makes you feel the most comfortable. If your camera does not have a built-in intervalometer however, I really do highly recommend getting one as it will make shooting stacks fully automated. Doing this process manually can be annoying af.\n\n# Calculating how many shots you need\n\nThe more shots you take, the cleaner the output stacked image will be. But, there is a point where diminishing returns kicks in. To keep things simple for this post though, I do not think that is something to worry about. Focus on shooting anywhere between 2 minutes to 30 minutes worth of shots, depending on what and how you are shooting.\n\nUse your intervalometer to figure out how long the sequence will take.  So let\u2019s say according to the [NPF Rule](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/advanced-astrophotography-shutter-time-calculator/) you are going to have a 15 second shutter speed at f/2.8 and ISO 3200. If you dial in that you want 7 shots with a 1 second interval in between, that would be 112 seconds spend shooting. That is a pretty good chunk of data, but you can still get some more and get an even cleaner shot.\n\n**A few hot notes:** \n\n* Like I said, the more shots you get the better. If you find you are using a higher ISO like 6400 and above, it would be wise to get more shots.\n* If you are pressed for time in any way. For example clouds are rolling in, you gotta leave, you want to take other shots, you sandwich is getting cold, etc. then shoot less.\n* The tradeoff of shooting more shots is less noise and thus more detail.\n* If I personally am stacking I will usually go for 10-30 minutes of data for my nightscapes. Deep space is whole other ball game. For the purposes of this tut, we are focusing on nightscapes and the Milky Way with a wider lens.\n\nOnce you have toyed around with your intervalometer, shoot! Let the technology do the work for you. Set it and forget it. This is where not having the intervalometer will be dingly, because you will need to trigger the camera manually for each shot. \n\n### Now the biggy, programming your camera to shoot!!!1111!!!111!!1!11011001!!!!\n\nThere are two ways to do this as discussed. Either use your external intervalometer or your cameras built-in one. I will go over both, but just know that many intervalometers and cameras work differently. This is intended to be a guideline and the methods discussed here may not directly correlate to your setup. However, the concepts are very similar between cameras and remotes and this should help give you an idea of how to program. \n\n### Method 1: external remote:\n\n1. [Plug in your remote and set your camera to bulb mode](https://i.imgur.com/rQMkmoj.jpg). We want to give all shutter control to the remote.\n2. **Ensure long exposure noise reduction and self-timer are both off.**\n3. Dial in your other settings, such as ISO, aperture, white balance, and make sure your lens is in focus.\n4. Head over to your remote and power it on. [The first screen may indicate a delay.](https://i.imgur.com/bKeToa9.jpg) We do not need that for this so make sure everything shows a \u201c0.\u201d\n5. [The next screen](https://i.imgur.com/SjHtrZT.jpg)may show as \u201clong\u201d like my dog. He is long. This is your shutter speed. Dial it in according to the NPF rule.\n6. [The following is the interval.](https://i.imgur.com/VEnFq0Y.jpg) This is the duration between each shot. We want this as short as possible for easier processing. I set mine to \u201c01\u201d for 1 second.\n7. [The final screen is marked as \u201cn.\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/W43uaLq.jpg) This is the number of shots to do. I will do 20 for this round, giving me a total of 100 seconds of data. Eh, should probably do more.\n8. Press start and sit back while the technology does the work for you. \n\n### Method 2: Built-In\n\n1. Built-in intervalometers work a little differently to external. We want the camera to have full control here, so first step is to dial in your shutter speed.\u00a0\n2. **Ensure long exposure noise reduction and self-timer are both off.**\n3. [Then dial in all your other settings, again ensure you are in focus.](https://i.imgur.com/So2MHhk.jpg)\n4. [Navigate to where the interval timer function is in you camera.](https://i.imgur.com/QOabPly.jpg)\n5. Make sure the time is set to[the time now](https://i.imgur.com/eEGnOG1.jpg)if your camera has that option. \n6. [Programming the interval is a bit different here](https://i.imgur.com/sABGQ2t.jpg). Unlike with the remote where the shutter speed was separate from the time between each shot, here it is integrated and can be a little confusing. In other words, my shutter speed is 5 seconds, but I sill want a 1 second interval beteen each shot. This means the total interval needs to be set to \u201c6 seconds\u201d\n7. [Set the number of shots to do, in my case again, 20.](https://i.imgur.com/EQqi714.jpg)\n\n# Processing\n\nAfter the shoot it is time to process. I mean yeah that is normally how it works but you get what I mean. There are loads of different pieces of free and paid stacking softwares out there. I personally use StarryLandscapeStacker (SLS), which is a **paid Mac application**. -----> -----> I !!!  will be creating !!!  an additional tutorial to use the Windoge free equivalent, Sequator as well. Both pieces of software are very similar however so if you have a basic understanding of a processing workflow you may be able to easily transfer this tutorial over to that one.\n\n1. First, we need to catalog everything in Lightroom or another similar raw image processor. While SLS can read RAW files, it is often easier to make some minor adjustments in something like LR or CaptureOne prior to loading into SLS.\n2. According to the SLS user guide, it is best to lower the contrast all the way, as well as turn off any sort of lens and vignette corrections. You also need to turn off noise reduction and sharpening. **My take:** Turn off sharpening and noise reduction, yes. But as far as contrast goes I find that sometimes dropping it down all the way and then trying to add it back in again later creates strange artifacts in the image. I would just leave this at 0. For lens corrections, your mileage may vary. Sometimes I get unwanted results with them on, sometimes with them off. You will need to experiment with this. I would first start with them **off.**\n3. I would also lower your highlights a bit and bump up the shadows a bit. I would adjust the exposure here as well if your image is too bright or too dark. **Do not** add any sort of clarity/texture/saturation adjustments however.\n4. Select all your images and apply your adjustments. \n5. Export as 16 bit TIFFs in the ProphotoRGB color space. **Do not resize your images!** Below are my export settings. If I were you, group your set of shots in a folder. This makes file management much easier to work with.\n6. Once complete, open up StarryLandscapeStacker and it will automatically prompt you to import your images. Locate the folder you made in the previous step and let em rip.\n7. SLS will automatically analyze your shots. If it detects any discrepancies, it will prompt you. It may ask you to select dark/light/flat frames. Don\u2019t worry about these for now. Everything here is considered a \u201clight\u201d frame. I will talk about these other frames in a future tut.\n8. Once complete, you will notice red dottts all over your image. Red dots are what SLS uses to determine where the sky is and isn\u2019t. With that in mind, you need to erase red dots where they are present in the foreground. Do this by clicking \u201cerase red dots\u201d over on the left. Wild, I know.\n9. The next thing that needs to be done in order for the software to work properly is some red dots actually need to be drawn back in following the horizon. Do so by clicking add red dots on the left. Draw your dots following your horizon line. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. What we are doing here is telling the software where the foreground stops and the sky begins. This will improve how it aligns and stacks your images.\n10. Now it is time to make the sky mask. Click the \u201cFind Sky\u201d button on the left and watch SLS do magic.\n11. The mask will most likely not be clean right outta the box, so it needs to be cleaned up. At this point, we need to use the blue paint to make sure the entire sky is covered. Likewise, the ground needs to be completely blue free. Eifel 65 would not be proud of the ground. The sky on the other hand\u2026\n12. If you are familiar with Photoshop, the brush works similarly to the one found in there. You can use the brackets to increase or decrease the brush size. You can also increase or decrease the opacity of the blue overlay if that helps you clean up the mask.\n13. In the end, only the sky should be blue. Try your best to clean up the horizon. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect (unlike my dog, who is perfect), there just needs to be absolutely no blue in the foreground. If you are not sure if you missed a spot, crank up the opacity of the blue. Missed a spot.\n14. Once the mask is ready to rave, mash that \u201cAlign and Composite\u201d button on the left and let the show begin.\n15. At this point, SLS has used the mask to create two different photos which have been seamlessly blended together. The first is the sky photo, which has been aligned using the stars in each photo. Since the stars move relative to the Earth\u2019s rotation, they need to be aligned.\n16. The second image is the foreground which does not move. There is no need to align these images. Doing so relative to the star layer would actually cause it to be blurred. Thus, it is stacked separately.\n17. There is a lot going on in the background of this software. In my opinion I feel like it is crazy how quick and effective it is. 2021 man. (altho pretty sure this joint came out in 2014)\n18. At this point, the software presents several algorithms you can choose from over on the left. If you hover over them, you will find a brief explanation of what they do. Play around with these and see which algo fits your image best. **My take:** I have had the best results with \u201cMean Min Horizon Noise,\u201d and \u201cMean Min Horizon Star Dupe.\u201d Again play around with these, your mileage may vary.\n19. Use the \u201cZ\u201d key to zoom in 100% while messing with these. This can help determine which one works best.\n20. Once complete, press \u201cSave the Current\u201d image. You can also save the mask you created with the blue paint. This can be helpful if you are masking in a different foreground image, for example if you took a blue hour foreground shot.\n21. Images will be saved as a 16-bit TIFF. Once you are done, continue with your edits by importing in an image editor of your choice.\n\n# Let\u2019s Recap\n\nOkay so here is what we learned in boating school today kids. \n\n1. Plan out your shot by taking quick test compositions of what you want to shoot.\n2. Figure out how long it is going to take to shoot your stack. The more shots you shoot, the cleaner your image will be, but the longer it will take.\n3. Use an external intervalometer or your camera\u2019s built-in function to take your shots.\n4. Once you get back to your computer, apply the same edits to each RAW file and export.\n5. Open the files in StarryLandscapeStacker and let it work its magic.\n6. Erase the dots in your foreground, and add dots in your sky and horizon where applicable.\n7. Find the sky and refine the mask with your brush, ensuring nothing in your foreground is painted.\n8. Composite your image and select an algorithm that works best for your shot.\n9. Save your image and enjoy an astro image that has significantly less noise than a single exposure. Continue working with your shot in your processing software of choice.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ms3bv1/tired_of_pesky_noise_messing_up_your_milky_way/"}, {"autor": "SunnyFlower_k", "selftext": "Disclaimer, I am a total noob when it comes to photography and I have no idea how to use the settings on any camera; I'm like a grandma, I have anxiety when it comes to technology.

And my cam has a nifty feature, automatically creating those, but I wanted more control. So I switched to interval shooting and then batch-edited the raw-images to my liking. But then I didn't want to use a full-on Video Editor to create the timelapse, yet I wanted to have full control. FFMPEG does that wonderfully, but getting the details right was a bit of a pain..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after a few days of trial and error and testing the featureset of FFMPEG I resorted to saving my presets to a batch-file. A few days later and that batch-file has grown into a script that offers high quality preset as well as full granular control. All you have to do is put it inside a folder with a sequence of images and run it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of right now it can encode prores (intermediate codec for editing in 10bit), h264, h265 and gifs (because why not!?). It presets (and lets you adjust) the Dimension/Aspect ratio, framerate, file-container, quality (profile/crf), bitrate, keyframe-interval, and maximum file-size (for gifs). If rendering in Prores it also automatically creates an identically-named proxy file in 720p for editing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought I would share this so I started using [github](https://github.com/Jan-Weigang/Timelapse-Creator) for this.\n\n**Questions for you:** \n\nWould this fit your workflow?

FFMPEG does that wonderfully, but getting the details right was a bit of a pain..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after a few days of trial and error and testing the featureset of FFMPEG I resorted to saving my presets to a batch-file. A few days later and that batch-file has grown into a script that offers high quality preset as well as full granular control. All you have to do is put it inside a folder with a sequence of images and run it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of right now it can encode prores (intermediate codec for editing in 10bit), h264, h265 and gifs (because why not!?). It presets (and lets you adjust) the Dimension/Aspect ratio, framerate, file-container, quality (profile/crf), bitrate, keyframe-interval, and maximum file-size (for gifs). If rendering in Prores it also automatically creates an identically-named proxy file in 720p for editing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought I would share this so I started using [github](https://github.com/Jan-Weigang/Timelapse-Creator) for this.\n\n**Questions for you:** \n\nWould this fit your workflow? Do you think I am missing an important feature or got something wrong?

Or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. Why should you listen to me? With the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; I am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. I am not claiming I am the smartest person in the world, but I do feel confident in what I am saying here.\n\nThe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. In fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions I have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nThe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. A value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nFor example: If I am running a lemonade stand, I buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. If that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know I am creating ($200-$100)/(1+3+1) = $20/hour. We also know how much value each step creates. If I wanted to hire a buddy to set up the stand, then we know that unless they are priced at below $20 its not worth it. If I want to make my little brother run the stand, then unless they are priced at below $60, its not worth it.\n\nWhy does this apply to photography? Because like any business making the \"lemonade\" is just one step in the process. You also need to do: business functions, like billing, marketing functions like advertising, process functions like editing, and other small things like transportation. People forget these, or under estimate them, and it will ruin your profit margin.\n\nLets look at some example of how you can apply this to your every day.\n\nExample 1: a friend is asking you to shoot their product/event/person/dog, how much should your friends and family discount be?\n\nMany people do not realize this, but there is actually a business case to give a friends and family discount. When you look at your value chain, look at all the steps you do not need to do because they are a friend. You don't need to advertise, because they came to you. You don't need to network because you were already friends. Your communication time is less because you can get some of the details worked out when you normally hang out with them. Lets say you normally charge $900 for a specific job, and you add up all of these savings and it is $300. If you are struggling to get clients, then you can offer them the job for $600, which saves them $300 and gets you profit you would not have gotten otherwise. If you are packed full time with clients, you can offer them the job for $750, saving them $150, and earning you $150 more than you would normally earn since you saved all these costs.\n\nIn either case having your value chain, and knowing what your needs are (more clients, more money, etc.) lets you make a financially sound decision when offering a discount. More importantly it is a win-win situation as both of you are better off had you not made the deal.\n\nExample 2: You hear about this new app that will help you get clients, should you join?\n\nSimilar to the lemonade stand example, except it is slightly reversed, instead of hiring someone and setting the financial boundaries, you are being hired and the boundaries are set for you. Once again your value chain can come to your rescue and help you decide. Now I am going to assume anyone considering this type of gig is new to the business, as they always are in my experience. What you first need to do is quickly think about any red flags from your value chain perspective. In previous jobs, how much time was spent getting the client vs shooting/editing? If networking is 70% of your time, then when you outsource that task you are outsourcing 70% of the profits.\n\nAs a new shooter you may think that 70% is an absurd number but a quick google search of how long pros spend actually shooting will validate it.\n\nhttps://www.thephoblographer.com/2015/07/30/how-professional-photographers-actually-spend-their-time/\n\nFrom this link you can see that most photographers spend ~15% of their time shooting an editing, with one spending as little as 6% of their time on it. So if the only thing you want to do is shoot/edit, then you will only see 15% of the profits. How does that app sound now? For most photographers (let alone new ones) you can expect a small restaurant to pay &lt;$400 for an average food shoot. This means if you work for an app on this gig, you can expect to get paid &lt;$60 for your work. Dividing that by the time to travel to the site, get set up, shoot the food, tear down, travel home, and edit for your hourly wage and you are probably netting &lt; $15/hour. Maybe that's worth it to you, maybe its not, but you at least have the information to make the decision yourself.\n\nSo how do you create a value chain?\n\nI know it might be tempting to steal the % off the link above, and while that is a good starting point it wont work. Your work is different and takes different efforts. Your clients are different and require more/less work. Your location is different and needs more/less time to get around. Most importantly you business model makes a huge difference, are you trying to sell prints? Are you trying to sell to individuals? Are you trying to get repeat customers? Make your own value chain.\n\nFor a small new photography business what you should probably do is\n\n1. List out every step you need to take for a profit. Include things like advertising, networking, doing your finances every month, harassing clients for payments.\n2. Record the time it will take at every step. If you don\u2019t know, ask some pros for advice, if everyone hates you, take your best estimate and adjust, but use this as a last resort.\n3. Come up with a reasonable hourly rate for each step. Think of it this way, dont ask what you want to be paid for each step, ask what you would be willing to pay per hour to have someone else do it. The reason is because this sets up your mind to think of these as the minimum costs, which is what you want.  \n4. Multiple your hours by hourly rate, and total up\n\nExample of a value chain:\n\nTask 1: recruiting clients. 20 hours per week. $10/hour. $200 total.  \nTask 2: shooting/editing. 3 jobs per week, 3 hours per job. $20/hour. $180 total.  \nTask 3: transportation. 3 jobs per week, 1 hour per job. $10/hour. $30 total.  \nTask 4: business operations (e.g. billing). 10 hours per week. $10/hour. $100 total.  \n\nWhat does this tell me?\n\n1. I will be expecting to work 42 hours a week\n2. I will be expecting to have $510 in \u201ccosts\u201d per week\n3. For 3 jobs I need them to pay at least $510/3 = $170 a job\n4. If I outsource client acquisition I lose $200/$510 = 40% of the potential profit\n5. If I find a client that does not require transportation (e.g. in my building) I can offer them a $30/$510 = 6% discount\n\n*Note that these are made up numbers with no real relation to the real world*\n\nKeep in mind that these are the breakeven points of everything. So I would not, for example, price a client at $170 because that would be \u201ccost plus pricing\u201d which is generally considered bad. Pricing is a whole different demon to tackle and would have to be its own post.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more from people much smarter than me, I would suggest starting with this HBS article. Do keep in mind, however, that Porter's more refined and detailed value chain analysis is meant for companies, with different departments.

Not sure if this is a technique you guys are familiar with / have tried before, so here's a quick summary: when you're shooting macro photos with a macro lens, your \"depth of field\" is very shallow - it's hard to get an entire object in focus, unless it's perfectly flat and 90 degrees to the lens. For 3D objects, that isn't usually going to be the case. \n\nSo, to get a really sharp macro photo where the whole subject is in good focus, you need to shoot a bunch of photos in sequence, either adjusting your focus slightly each time, or leaving your focus as-is and move the camera forward (or backwards) for each pic. I tried doing the first technique (adjusting focus slightly over and over) but my results were always kinda crappy, probably due to my inexperience + the fact that I'm using a very old / cheap macro lens. I found I was over-adjusting each time and the output looked weird, with stripes that were in focus and stripes that weren't. Not great. \n\nI did more research and learned that I could improve my results by using a 'macro focusing rail' - basically, a piece of hardware you mount your camera to, which allows you to move the whole camera (and thus your focal point) forwards/backwards by microscopic increments. After my sweetie and I took our son on a Cub Scout hike in the Marin Headlands yesterday, we met up with a dude I found on Craigslist over in Sausalito, and he sold me his barely-used macro rail, and I've just done my first test shoot with it. \n\n[This pic shows my setup](https://i.imgur.com/JiIw8DD.jpg): Basically, the macro rail sits on the tripod, and the camera sits on a small carriage mounted to the rail and attached to a long threaded screw in the center. By turning that little crank at the back, the screw turns, which scoots the carriage forward/backward by tiny amounts.\n\nMy first test subject is my grandfather Frank's old pocket watch, which (if I remember correctly) he was given by his father when he and his twin brother Albert graduated high school. I got the macro lens [focused on the front edge of the pocket watch](https://i.imgur.com/AX06kuh.jpg), snapped a photo, turned the crank once (moving the camera forward a tiny bit), snapped a photo, turned the crank once, snapped a photo, etc. etc., all the way to the [very back of the watch.](https://i.imgur.com/Yr1YXI3.jpg) I used my remote trigger to avoid jostling the camera too much between shots. When all was said-and-done, I ended up with 38 photos, each with a slightly different portion of the pocket watch in focus.

Not sure if this is a technique you guys are familiar with / have tried before, so here's a quick summary: when you're shooting macro photos with a macro lens, your \"depth of field\" is very shallow - it's hard to get an entire object in focus, unless it's perfectly flat and 90 degrees to the lens. For 3D objects, that isn't usually going to be the case. \n\nSo, to get a really sharp macro photo where the whole subject is in good focus, you need to shoot a bunch of photos in sequence, either adjusting your focus slightly each time, or leaving your focus as-is and move the camera forward (or backwards) for each pic. I tried doing the first technique (adjusting focus slightly over and over) but my results were always kinda crappy, probably due to my inexperience + the fact that I'm using a very old / cheap macro lens. I found I was over-adjusting each time and the output looked weird, with stripes that were in focus and stripes that weren't. Not great. \n\n-----> I !!!  did more research and learned that -----> -----> I !!!  could improve !!!  my results by using a 'macro focusing rail' - basically, a piece of hardware you mount your camera to, which allows you to move the whole camera (and thus your focal point) forwards/backwards by microscopic increments. After my sweetie and I took our son on a Cub Scout hike in the Marin Headlands yesterday, we met up with a dude I found on Craigslist over in Sausalito, and he sold me his barely-used macro rail, and I've just done my first test shoot with it. \n\n[This pic shows my setup](https://i.imgur.com/JiIw8DD.jpg): Basically, the macro rail sits on the tripod, and the camera sits on a small carriage mounted to the rail and attached to a long threaded screw in the center. By turning that little crank at the back, the screw turns, which scoots the carriage forward/backward by tiny amounts.\n\nMy first test subject is my grandfather Frank's old pocket watch, which (if I remember correctly) he was given by his father when he and his twin brother Albert graduated high school. I got the macro lens [focused on the front edge of the pocket watch](https://i.imgur.com/AX06kuh.jpg), snapped a photo, turned the crank once (moving the camera forward a tiny bit), snapped a photo, turned the crank once, snapped a photo, etc. etc., all the way to the [very back of the watch.](https://i.imgur.com/Yr1YXI3.jpg) I used my remote trigger to avoid jostling the camera too much between shots. When all was said-and-done, I ended up with 38 photos, each with a slightly different portion of the pocket watch in focus. Just for fun, I also [combined all 38 photos into a GIF](https://imgur.com/bGNjuow), so you can see the focal point moving from one end to the other.\n\nSo, getting to the point: after combining all 38 photos using a *completely insane* shareware program called Helicon Focus, [I got a final output, combining the in-focus portions of each of the 38 photos](https://i.imgur.com/opfm5vU.jpg).

From the very beginning, I cared about color, forms, shapes, grids. But that's all motion. No action, yet.\n\nCoincidentally, as soon as I get the camera,  I go on a family vacation.

Sigh, I know... \n\nAt the time I liked probably one or two images from that trip. Now I like a few. Classic as-time-goes-by-you-understand-better sorta thing.

I walked and I walked and I walked endless kilometers and...nothing. Okay, still good, came back home bummed almost every day. Repeated the process. Nothing much at all. I realized I'm just not comfortable shooting in congested places. The street photographers mostly that I follow on Instagram and Twitter, none of them also, are the kind to take photos of a lot of people. Wide, empty, towns, minimal compositions. When I say I don't have such places to go to, I mean it. It's not cliche. Please understand this. I can even give you proof of the subreddit here to show you how most places from here actually look. I cannot force myself to shoot something that I don't like just for the sake of clicking it. That makes zero sense. If you don't like it, you don't like it. These things come naturally.\n\nThen I thought, oh street is difficult, I'm gonna do portraits. So that started alright. Now I mostly do that. I'm known for that. I've improved on that. \n\nBut,\n\nI really, really,  feel like I'm not doing enough. All the photographers that I look up to, shoot so so much. I, on the other hand, shoot so little. I currently have a job that I have to do to support myself financially (Ironically that's a graphic design job and I happen to have job experience in it prior). So all I get are my weekends where I plan stuff. Either some portrait work; which is serious and mostly out of my control since external factors are huge in this category and when that does not happen, I go out in previously picked out places and \"attempt\" to do street photography. I repeat the sad process as told above and I come back with...nothing.

I have had two odd jobs before the current one. I'm getting sadder and sadder. I'm not practicing enough. I'm young, I want to give all my effort, all my time, but it doesn't seem to happen that way. I don't know what to do. I know the kind of work I like. I don't know how to get to them. I like lifestyle/travel/editorial/outdoors.... the kind of work that gets printed in a cover magazine story. I want my work to be story-driven. I gradually want to be able to make a photobook of mine. I'm trying every day to seek/ask for specific opportunities but it seems like, the whole photography market is so different here, that the stuff you want is not there. I get it. If you want to earn, you have to follow what the market cares about. I know what I want to work on now. Unlike a few years ago, I've changed. \n\nI know one thing for certain. Previously, just like graphic design, I wanted to do something cool. Photography is cool. So I wanted to do that. \n\nNow it matters to me. It has changed me personally. Cool or uncool, it is insignificant.

But can I offer a thousand quality images that find potential buyers to earn me a measly $100 a year, or even a month? Isn't it just quantity over quality and hoping to \"hit the spot\"? What about potential \"reputation damage\" when your stock photography portfolio does not \"feel right\" to you, but you just try to make an extra income with that? Tailored to perceived needs of a buyer?\n\nI really don't know, I am unsure if it's worth it and something to be pursued or just a total waste of time. And yet, I keep on contemplating on pursuing the idea of uploading 1000-2000 images, solely to have the \"chance\" of getting that pocket money over the years.\n\nDo you have an opinion on that?\n\nIf so, please share it. Right now, I am just torn between potential money out of unused images (or even directly trying to pursue images directly for Stock photos) *or* just leaving it entirely because it's a waste of time. Not sure if anyone can relate to that.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/l4qbs6/your_opinion_on_stock_photography/"}, {"autor": "DontWuzzlerTheTIger", "selftext": "nan", "title": "Join the wuzzl.pic - Photography Discord Server! ~ Hey Guys, I wanna let you now that I created an discord server for photographers!

I also shot night time stuff and architectural frames. Post Covid, I have started to shoot more documentary/landscape stuff. I am not sure what particular style I should pursue. My favourite photogs are probably don McCullin and Robert Capa. \n\n\n\nI am also interested in the cinematography featured in Felini\u2019s films. I watch his films on occasion to gain inspiration. \n\nI have recently quit sharing all of my photos on Flickr, Reddit and Instagram, as I found the experience very disheartening. I have started to buy photo books and other stuff (such as the photographer\u2019s eye) to learn my skills. I watch a lot of YT stuff to try and learn more about the art of photography, by looking at the frames taken by the greats (T.

All cams are CLA\u2019d. I believe I have reached a point where I do not want to buy any other gear, as I want to work on own skills.\n\nPrior to Covid, I worked in a capital city and would take my camera with me everywhere, so I was mainly a street photographer. I also shot night time stuff and architectural frames. Post Covid, I have started to shoot more documentary/landscape stuff. I am not sure what particular style I should pursue. My favourite photogs are probably don McCullin and Robert Capa. \n\n\n\nI am also interested in the cinematography featured in Felini\u2019s films. I watch his films on occasion to gain inspiration. \n\nI have recently quit sharing all of my photos on Flickr, Reddit and Instagram, as I found the experience very disheartening. I have started to buy photo books and other stuff (such as the photographer\u2019s eye) to learn my skills. I watch a lot of YT stuff to try and learn more about the art of photography, by looking at the frames taken by the greats (T. Hopper\u2019s channel is great for this). \n\n\nTLDR; I am at a fork in the road with my photography. It is my main passion and a hobby for life.  \n\nmy question is this - how do you guys develop your own skills to improve your photography?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/q11fjy/the_end_of_gas_and_the_beginning_of_my_studies/"}, {"autor": "Quantum_Noodles_", "selftext": "nan", "title": "First time doing night photography (sorry if it is bad I'm a complete beginner) ease criticise so I can improve :)", "num-comments": 2, "score": 1, "date": "2021-10-18 16:22:53", "content": "First time doing night photography (sorry if it is bad -----> I !!!
