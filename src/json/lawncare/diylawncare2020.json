Then I threaded a metal wire through the middle of the roll, so it poked out on each end. I took another wire and attached it to some holes in the side of the mower. Using the wire from the roll, I wound the ends around the second wire, to create a secure way to attach the roll to the mower. It took some playing around to get the lengths of the wires right to center the striper on the mower. Lastly, I tied a rope around the center of the roll, and attached the other end to the bar where the starter cord is. The purpose of this is to aid in reversing. Normally with a striper you can't roll the mower backwards, as it gets caught in the striper.

Each yard is approx. 2200 sq feet, with a 600 sq feet side yard. I aerated last fall and put down an application of weed and feed this spring, but was really planning to attack this fall.

I'm not trying to make it flat, but maybe lessen some immediate dips and holes from pulling weeds and critters digging. \n3. I will seed. Not sure what type of seed or how yet. Use a spreader? Get that green mossy seedy stuff? Something else? \n4. I will fertilize with Scotts Weed and Feed. I can do something else instead, or in addition to the weed and feed. I know you\u2019re supposed to follow the prescribed directions and not use illegal substances, but if there is like a steroids of lawncare, I\u2019d inject it. I don't necessarily know how often or in what order to apply various treatments if I combine multiple.   \n5. I will water. And then water some more. And then water more.

Also know I have no axe to grind with companies that want to sell premixed solutions.  If you want to buy that product from the famous youtuber or next day Amazon Prime product, God bless.  For those that want to DIY for cheaper, this is for you.\n\n**What is Humic Acid** Humic acid is a product of Leonardite coal which is mined from many parts of the world.  It is arguably the world\u2019s best organic material for use in a lawn.  It is both a terrific product as a soil amendment and for root development, a real two trick pony.\n\n**What is kelp** Kelp is a product of the sea which is harvested from many parts of the world.  It is arguably the world\u2019s best organic material for use in a lawn.  It is both a terrific as a soil amendment and for root development, a real two trick pony.\n\n**Did you just copy/paste those definitions** Basically.  Both are natural.  Both are terrific alone.  If you wish to learn more, please visit google, but be warned:  the well of nerd runs very deep on these so you best screw on your propeller cap tight.  A nice general primer about these type of products, also known as biostimulants, may be found via [this link](https://archive.lib.msu.edu/tic/tgtre/article/2001aug6.pdf).\n\n**What about fulvic acid** Fulvic acid is part and parcel of humic acid.  You must be part geologist, materials scientist and attorney to know the difference.  You cannot name and/or sell fulvic acid in some states due to legal reasons.  If want to know more, have fun falling down the google mineshaft on that topic.  It is only mentioned as you see those words peppered everywhere online with biostimulant/humic/kelp products.\n\n**Who can use and are there any interaction warnings** You can.  Humic and Kelp do not care about your USDA Plant Hardiness Zone, your elevation, your grass type, your sun/shade ratio, your rain/moisture, if you have new sod, new seedlings, live on a watershed, have animals, have kids, raise bees, or have great or poor soil test results.  You may apply on the same day as herbicide, fungicide, pesticide, fertilizer, seed or any other soil amendment in temperatures from 0 degrees Kelvin to 50 degrees Celsius.  Tank mixing other liquids or combing other granular products in a spreader is verboten.\n\n**Use separate or together and what ratio** Use of either alone is a great thing for your lawn.  Together is even better.  Mix them into a 5:2 ratio of Humic:Kelp and you have the greatest root development tool in the history of the world.  [Famous 10 year Virginia Tech study on the 5:2 topic](http://www.aapfco.org/presentations/2015/2015_AN_biostimulant_research.pdf).\n\n**How much to apply** This is the $64,000 question as there is no answer.  There are 100+ makers of humic/kelp products and they don\u2019t agree as there are many concentration levels with the liquid and granular application form factors.  Since both products are organic, you cannot over apply unless maybe you decide to level your lawn with granular humic acid.\n\n**Any Canada/Organic options** These products have no restrictions in Canada and may be used during fertilizer blackout periods.  Since they are natively organic, they have no chemical restrictions.  And use of the word organic here does not imply OMRI/USDA certified organic as that\u2019s a whole other ball of wax, but a general term meaning not man made.\n\n**When to use** Groupthink says the best time for these products would be at seed/sod/overseed followed by the active growing period for your grass type.  You can also apply during no fertilizer periods some localities have.  About the only universal \u201cno period\u201d might be when there is literal snow on the ground.\n\n**Granular or liquid for purchasing** Both humic and kelp come in both form factors.  Liquid is the least wise choice as you are paying for water to be shipped, you have no control over the concentration and you must spray it.  Granular means you are in control of the concentration and you can spread it or turn into a liquid and spray it.\n\n**How do I make liquid humic acid** Most commercial liquid humic products you see are 12%, so let\u2019s use that as the standard.  Eight ounces of dry humic mixed in 1 gallon of water becomes a 12% humic acid solution.  Most commercial liquid humic products recommend you spray this at a rate of 2oz/gallon.  You can follow this, use less or spray at full strength if you so desire.\n\n**How is DIY saving me money** One DIY humic example, you can do your own math on the other products:  [The Andersons Humic DG]( https://www.amazon.com/Andersons-Humic-Granular-Soil-Conditioner/dp/B00D9F3QY0/) is $65 for 40lbs.  One bag will net you 80 gallons of 12% humic acid solution.  $65/80 gallons is $0.81/gallon.  Most commercial liquid humic products are $20/gallon at a minimum.\n\n**How do I make liquid kelp** Same as humic.  Or mix a 5:2 blend or custom blend with whatever amount you have on hand.  Do ratios by weight as it\u2019s the most accurate method for ratios.  Be crazy\u2026make a 50/50 blend at 30% concentration\u2026have fun with it.\n\n**Any sprayer advice** If you are making a liquid for a sprayer application, you have to do so with a high degree of concentration.  Perhaps get a garage sale blender to aid in refining the product dry and/or wet.  Invest in a mixing attachment for your drill if bulk mixing.  Use a chinois with cheesecloth for a final straining before use.  These extra steps should ensure a clog free spraying experience.\n\n**Granular or liquid for use** This is another question without a great answer.  These products are soil amendments and root development products, so one might say granular application is best, but it would be easier to get the liquid ratios correct for those seeking the perfect 5:2 or custom ratio.\n\n**Do I need to water after application** If you feel like it.  Rain tomorrow or next week will get it into the soil eventually.\n\n**Other uses of these** The hydroponics folks, the marijuana cultivators and the tomato dorks are all huge fans of these products.  If you have a garden or just about anything that is green, feel free to spray/deep soak/granular apply as you desire.\n\n**Where do I buy** These are the cheapest options I have found.  If you find a cheaper option, please let me know and I\u2019ll add it here but keep in mind:  This request is only for shipped options as Sally in Sacramento don\u2019t care that you can get kelp in person for 99 cents a pound at your local hydroponics store.

[famous 10 year virginia tech study on the 5:2 topic](http://www.aapfco.org/presentations/2015/2015_an_biostimulant_research.pdf).\n\n**how much to apply** this is the $64,000 question as there is no answer.  there are 100+ makers of humic/kelp products and they don\u2019t agree as there are many concentration levels with the liquid and granular application form factors.  since both products are organic, you cannot over apply unless maybe you decide to level your lawn with granular humic acid.\n\n**any canada/organic options** these products have no restrictions in canada and may be used
