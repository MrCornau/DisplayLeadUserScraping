They have all helped me tremendously as I start my journey to having the best yard on the block.\n\nI wanted to share what I've done so far this year with you all to get your feedback/guidance/recommendations as I continue forward! Side note, yard work is a very expensive hobby lol.\n\nAs for some background info on my yard. My yard is roughly 7500 sqft. I have the main yard in these photo's and then a side yard thats next to my drive way but I forgot to take those picture's so I'll upload them at a later date. I'm honestly not sure what 'zone' I'm in but I'm in the Chicagoland area so whatever zone that would be considered, obviously cool season grass. I'm not sure what grass types I currently have since I just moved into this house in 2019 and the yard's been around since 1999 but I'm assuming a combo of fescue/rye/kbg.\n\nSo a timeline of what I've done so far this year.\n\n**April:**\n\nIn early April I had my lawn aerated by a landscaper.\n\nIn Late April/Early May, I purchased a weed puller ([something like this](https://www.amazon.com/Walensee-Stainless-Strength-Permanently-Dandelion/dp/B07GDBY3YS/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=weedpuller&amp;qid=1625462240&amp;sr=8-3)). I pulled all weeds I could in the front and back yards. The majority of which were dandelions which were real bad this year but weren't a problem last year for some reason. I'm honestly not sure what other species of weeds I pulled since I'm still learning them.\n\n**May:**\n\nIn Early May, I purchased a dethatcher ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_aps_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;adId=A06453882W1V9505Z9PPZ&amp;url=%2FGreenworks-14-Inch-Corded-Dethatcher-27022%2Fdp%2FB0030BG1HM%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fcrid%3D1L90X22I8CLXU%26dchild%3D1%26keywords%3Ddethatcher%26qid%3D1625462308%26sprefix%3Ddetatcher%252Caps%252C185%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26psc%3D1&amp;qualifier=1625462308&amp;id=8208689853126403&amp;widgetName=sp_atf)) and dethatched my yard. (I'm currently using an 8yo Craftsman push mower and I rarely bag since it triples my cut time and this mower doesn't mulch so after a year of doing this, I had a good amount of thatch build up that I removed).\n\nOn Memorial day I overseeded (purchased seed from a local nursey, it was their 'commercial mix' of  40% KBG, 25% Kenblue KBG, 25% Laredo II Perennial Ryegrass, 10% Blackhawk Creeping Red Fescue). I put about 35lbs of seed down. (I'm using the Scott's Elite Spreader). I then covered the yard as best as I could with peatmoss (god that's a dirty workout). I didn't buy enough peat imo (bought 10 2.2cu bags from Menards). I spread as best as I could with a shovel toss and then went back over the area's of concern or that were really thin to give it a little extra protection. I then followed up by laying down some Lesco Starter Fertilizer (18-24-12). I ended up using the whole 50lb bag (probably a mistake).\n\nFor irrigation, I did a DIY irrigation system using 6 Orbit Voyager II mounted on sprinkler spikes and connected with 5/8 garden hoses. I'm using the stock nozzle which puts out .5 gpm (it's the stock/preinstalled nozzle tip). I have them run twice a day for 15 minutes at 8am and 7pm (controlled by a Melnor 76280). This was mainly set up to keep my seeds wet, I'll likely adjust the schedule now that I have germination. I would eventually like to bury these but one project at a time lol. I did buy some poly pipe and 3/4\" blu-lock fittings so I'm starting to build it out.\n\nAbout 1.5 weeks later, I started to see germination, and then after a week of rain I had a ton of germination and a bunch of mushroom come up, especially where the peat was (I read that mushrooms are good).\n\n**July:**\n\nToday I cut the grass for the first time (most of the mushrooms cleared up by now). It took me this long to cut it since A, it wasn't growing very long/high for the first week or two, and B, We've had about 2 weeks of rain and whenever I was finally off work early enough to cut it, it would rain. Here are the before and after photo's. I'm proud of the work so far and can definitely see some improvement but still got a lot of work to do. It's kind of like getting a C on a test you were expecting an A. Still solid progress, but you want to do better lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Misc/Things I know I did 'wrong':**\n\nI probably aerated too soon in the season but the ground was wet and my landscaper said it would be a good time as it'd core nicely which it did.\n\nI know I seeded/fertilized way too late in the season but between my limited off days and the weather, this was the only time I could do it and I wanted to get started on the project instead of wasting another season. (I like seeing progress, even if tiny progress, because it keeps me motivated to move forward)\n\nI probably laid down too much fertilizer based on my square footage (I only burned 3 spots, so there's that, though to be fair, those spots were already rough before I seeded/fertilized).\n\nI didn't lay down any pre/post emergent since I didn't want to interfere with my seeding and I'm still learning about what to use and when to use it.\n\nI know my watering probably isn't ideal and now that I have germination, I should switch my watering times/lengths/frequency. I'm thinking of doing it at 5am for 30 minutes, every other day.\n\nI'm thinking of getting some Humic Acid and Kelp. I'm torn between Humic DG or the Humic Acid/Kelp Mixture from Simple Grow solutions. I was also gonna check out my local nursery to see what they have. I was gonna put that down in the next week or two, as well as seed some of the burned/thin spots again.\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Honda Mower to replaced my old mower. I feel like it would help my yard in terms of a less stressful cut/better mulching and help me by being far more enjoyable and easy to use.
