It used to have a giant evergreen right in the middle of it.  a wind storm a couple years ago blew it over and destroyed my fence, as well as the fences of my neighbours beside me - very thankful it didn't fall on the house! The tree has since been removed.  For the past two years, there has been a dirt mound in the middle of my backyard, of where the stump used to be.  It has actually grown, and has affected the slope of my backyard - rainfall actually drains towards the house now.  So, I was tired of looking at this eyesore and so I took it upon myself to fix the slope of the backyard. \n\nI researched and know the basic steps I need to take to complete this task:\n\n1. Remove top layer\n2. Till the top soil\n3. Rake and even out grade of top soil\n4. Add new top soil and sand mixture - using sand to help with drainage and new roots to grow\n5. Covering with sod\n\nUpon removing the top layer I've come into a problem:\n\nAlthough the giant evergreen was removed, the roots remained and continued to grow underground, growing over most of my backyard - including existing planters built by stacking old bricks and stones.  As I dug and removed the top layer, I would come up with shovels of dirt, stones and broken bricks, while encountering the network of roots that has formed and taken over my backyard.\n\nI have not finished removing the top layer, but I foresee that what I will be left with is a dirt layer filled with shards of broken bricks and stones/ pebbles, with roots of an evergreen underneath.  My question is this:\n\n1. How will this affect my ability to till the soil using a till machine/ tool?\n2. How will this affect the laying of new sod?\n3.
