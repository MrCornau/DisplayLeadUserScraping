It is bearable for me and I still like the photos, but is there any real way to improve it? I\u2019ve seen some quality results on the internet, but no substantial information on what works best for this film, and I know it is all personal preference and one can't expect fine grain from 3200 iso film and whatnot but as far as I understand there is a way to develop it with a finer grain and more overall \"smooth\" look. \n\nP.S. Also any info on Xtol dilutions would be super helpful. I read that the more you dilute it, the more grain you get. True or false? Or maybe is there any kind of a guide or something on major developers/dilutions/agitation methods that i'm not aware of?

When you change the ISO on a digital camera you are changing BOTH the sensor sensitivity AND the in camera meter (they will match). The compensation function will leave the sensitivity unchanged but allow for intentional under and over exposure for the frame(s) for which it is used. This is not typically used to meter exposure for an entire frame, but to meter a select area of a frame, such as highlights or shadows. Because the ISO setting directly controls the sensitivity of the sensor, you can easily change ISO from one frame to another without and adverse effects.\n\nIn the case of analog (film) photography, the film itself is rated at a particular ISO. This is a physical function of the film/emulsion and CAN NOT BE CHANGED.\n\nIf a film camera has an ISO button/dial, and the ISO is set or changed, either via automatic DX coding or manually via an ISO dial, you are NOT setting or changing the ISO of the film, you are setting the sensitivity of the METER on the camera. \n\nWhen the meter is set at the same ISO as the film, this will give you the proper exposure, and is considered shooting at BOX SPEED. When you set the ISO to something different than the ISO of the film, the FILM ITSELF does not change, but the sensitivity of the meter does. This means that the frame(s) shot in this manner will either be over exposed or under exposed.\n\nWhen you INTENTIONALLY set the ISO to a value that is different from the film itself, it is called PUSHING or PULLING the film. This can be useful if the film you have is either too fast (Higher ISO = Faster film) or to slow (Lower ISO = Slower film) for your lighting. Pushing film is done when your film is too slow for the lighting conditions. As an example say you are shooting in a dark club, but only have TRI-X 400. You can set the camera ISO to 1600 and shoot the film. You have now PUSHED the film 2 stops. (400 to 800 = 1 stop, 800 to 1600 = 1 stop, for a total of 2 stops). The same would be true if you have loaded 800 speed film but are shooting on a bright sunny day. You can set your camera ISO to 200 and shoot the film. You have now PULLED the film 2 stops. (800 to 400 = 1 stop, 400 to 200 = 1 stop, for a total of 2 stops). It is important to remember, however, that the ISO of the film did not change. The film will need to be developed differently than if it were developed at box speed. The different development process is what will allow the images to come back more or less properly exposed. This is called PUSH or PULL developing. When you send your images to the lab you MUST give instructions to push or pull the film the appropriate number of stops. Failure to so so will lead to over or under exposed film.\n\nIt is also crucially important to understand that because the ISO on a film camera controls the meter and NOT the film, changing the ISO from one frame to another to get a better exposure WILL NOT WORK, but will result in a random mix of over exposed, under exposed, and properly exposed images. If you remember from above, pushing and pulling works because of a change in DEVELOPMENT. Because we must develop an entire roll at once, you can only push or pull and entire roll, and not individual frames. This is where exposure compensation comes in.\n\nRemembering that the ISO of the film never changes, compensation is useful for properly exposing specific areas of a frame WITHOUT changing the ISO setting on the camera (preventing accidental improper exposure of future frames if you forget to re-set it). For example, say you are shooting a picture of a friend agains a bright sky. Your meter will likely meter the ENTIRE scene. This means that your friend may very well be in shadow, and the final image will end up with the sky more or less exposed while your friend looks dark. If you use exposure compensation, however, you can fix this. Say you think your friend will be 2 stops parked than the background. Set the exposure compensation to +2 for that frame only. The meter will then adjust the reading for THAT FRAME. The background will likely be down out, but your friend will be properly exposed. The return the compensation to 0 for the remaining frames. This will allow you some control over adjusting frame to frame exposure even though you can not change the ISO of the film.

I can only hope that I'm an idiot and this is an easy fix, because right now I'm breaking about 2/3 of the rolls I shoot. Hoping someone might know why this keeps happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kotfthsq9ti41.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=511a66278863a77e5bd6f47f54a7fe3bc862deed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8fuuv4bs9ti41.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e813f1cbdb938905535eddfd366f9b269c8e8e5", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/f8mthj/olympus_om1_breaking_film_during_rewind/"}, {"autor": "LordPurloin", "selftext": "Just want to confirm... if I develop 2 rolls of film at once I take 2 off of the life span of my developer?

This was the first time i realised that not only the developer and the filmstock each for themselves but especially the combination of both can have a dramatic effect on the amount of grain, the sharpness and the contrast of the resulting image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoooo since i'm more or less stuck inside like everyone else i ordered some black and white films and developers and tested every possible combination.\n\nI wanted to check three questions i had:\n\n1. What is the best film/developer combination if you are on a budget and how does the result compare to something like Delta 100?\n2. Are most \"cheaper\" filmstocks - like CHM 100 // Kentmere 100 // RPX 100 // really the same emulsion, just resleeved and rebranded?\n3. Are Fomadon Excel and Kodak Xtol the same? \n\nI tested 12 Filmstocks (6 at asa 100 and 6 at asa 400) and 5 developers (in overall 9 different dilutions).   \nIn order to get at least a bit more similar development times i added/subtracted at most 15 sec if necessary. I still ended up with 40ish separate developments.. perfect thing to do in summer.\n\nSince it was such a tedious work i thought i share my results in case some of you have the same questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If it comes to ASA 100 film the best budget-solution is the more or less cheapest one you can find. I really was astonished how little grain even the cheaper emulsions produce while still retaining a more than acceptable amount of sharpness. Keep in mind, all of this still comes at a price. Most cheaper stocks lack the dynamic range, dry quite curly or aren't that scratch-resistant.    \n(Kentmere 100 for example sadly still curls after 24h of drying and scratches way to easy)  \nIn the case of ASA 400 film it's about the same. The only thing that becomes more evident is, that developers like A49 // Atomal49 // Xtol // Ultrafin really do a way better job in keeping the amount of grain at an acceptable level.  \nSo tldr:   \nCheapest film + Xtol // Atomal will give better results than expensive film + Rodinal  1+50 // FX39.  \n\n2. Yes and No..   \nCHM 100+400 // RPX 100+400 // APX 100+400 are most likely the same film.  \nKentmere films on the other hand show a similar dynamic range and grain structure compared to FP4+/HP5+.

This was the first time i realised that not only the developer and the filmstock each for themselves but especially the combination of both can have a dramatic effect on the amount of grain, the sharpness and the contrast of the resulting image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoooo since i'm more or less stuck inside like everyone else i ordered some black and white films and developers and tested every possible combination.\n\nI wanted to check three questions i had:\n\n1. What is the best film/developer combination if you are on a budget and how does the result compare to something like Delta 100?\n2. Are most \"cheaper\" filmstocks - like CHM 100 // Kentmere 100 // RPX 100 // really the same emulsion, just resleeved and rebranded?\n3. Are Fomadon Excel and Kodak Xtol the same? \n\nI tested 12 Filmstocks (6 at asa 100 and 6 at asa 400) and 5 developers (in overall 9 different dilutions).   \nIn order to get at least a bit more similar development times i added/subtracted at most 15 sec if necessary. I still ended up with 40ish separate developments.. perfect thing to do in summer.\n\nSince it was such a tedious work i thought i share my results in case some of you have the same questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If it comes to ASA 100 film the best budget-solution is the more or less cheapest one you can find. I really was astonished how little grain even the cheaper emulsions produce while still retaining a more than acceptable amount of sharpness. Keep in mind, all of this still comes at a price. Most cheaper stocks lack the dynamic range, dry quite curly or aren't that scratch-resistant.    \n(Kentmere 100 for example sadly still curls after 24h of drying and scratches way to easy)  \nIn the case of ASA 400 film it's about the same. The only thing that becomes more evident is, that developers like A49 // Atomal49 // Xtol // Ultrafin really do a way better job in keeping the amount of grain at an acceptable level.  \nSo tldr:   \nCheapest film + Xtol // Atomal will give better results than expensive film + Rodinal  1+50 // FX39.  \n\n2. Yes and No..   \nCHM 100+400 // RPX 100+400 // APX 100+400 are most likely the same film.  \nKentmere films on the other hand show a similar dynamic range and grain structure compared to FP4+/HP5+. Although the film base isn't the same i wouldn't be surprised if the emulsion is.   \nFomapan 100+400 = Lomography Earl Grey+Lady Grey  \n\n3. Even though Fomadon Excel and Kodak Xtol behave similarly, Xtol still has a small lead. The only annoying thing is, that it's only sold in packages for 5L of solution.

I got a lot of great advice here (and even a few donor cameras... thanks u/mochaNava!), and it really helped out. I felt very supported by this amazing community, so I felt it warranted a bit of an update.\n\nThe class - I've done two class rotations so far (the first was 5 weeks, the second was 4 weeks) and had 30 minutes per day with the students to work. I will be doing three more rotations between now and June. Each class has about 27 students in it. To get it approved by the administration, the class also has a written requirement, so their final project is featuring an important person at our school (student or adult) that has had a positive impact on them and doing a portrait series of them to go with it.\n\nThe time goes by really quickly and it has been difficult to cover all of the basic principles of photography in such a short time while also taking the students through the writing process. What I tried to do was go over the basics the first week and get every student to take a few shots so I could develop the rolls over the weekend. This way the students could be excited about the results, see how their focus is, etc. Then they could plan their portraits over the next two weeks.\n\nI am funding this project myself, so I am bulk rolling Kentmere 400 and developing and scanning at home over the weekend. This, unfortunately, limits the number of times students can photograph, see the results, and learn from their mistakes. I'm currently DSLR scanning with a Lomography Digitaliza, which is great, but I'd like an option to slide a whole roll through to get done more quickly. I'm currently looking for access to a 3D printer so I can print something like u/bradbrok created [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/dy79es/i_designed_a_thing_to_make_dslr_scanning_easier/).\n\nTakeaways:\n\n* Students quickly grasp the concept of shutter speed. The 5th graders have done especially well with it, since they do a lot of work with fractions this year. They notice the pattern of the fraction doubling/halving every stop and can articulate that photos are dark because they let in less light and bright because they let in more light. They also have a solid grasp on motion blur and why they shouldn't hand hold below 1/60.\n* Students struggled a bit more with aperture. They understand the idea of a bigger opening letting in more light, but with the time constraints they didn't have much time to see its effects on depth of field. The numbers also seem somewhat random to them since they don't double every time.\n* Focusing is HARD. We practiced with every camera, but I really thought that a split prism would be easiest for them to focus with, so we did the majority of our work on Canon AE-1's, Minolta X-700's, and Pentax MX's. A large portion of their first shots missed focus, so I found myself checking focus for nearly all of their final portraits. We will continue to practice with all of the cameras, but during the next unit I am going to push cameras with microprisms - Pentax K1000's and Spotmatics. My next rotation is 6 weeks long (yay!) so if I have time I'd like to give students the option to choose what is best for them.\n* This is brand new to them, and they love it. Most of them have no clue what film is on the first day (they mainly think it means movies) and they ask where the memory card goes, but they love getting to use old/vintage cameras. I've had students come up to me after the course is over and say they miss photography, or even ask where I got the cameras because they want one for themselves.\n\nI'm excited to see what the next few months bring as I continue to adapt the course for incoming students.

I got a lot of great advice here (and even a few donor cameras... thanks u/mochaNava!), and it really helped out. I felt very supported by this amazing community, so I felt it warranted a bit of an update.\n\nThe class - I've done two class rotations so far (the first was 5 weeks, the second was 4 weeks) and had 30 minutes per day with the students to work. I will be doing three more rotations between now and June. Each class has about 27 students in it. To get it approved by the administration, the class also has a written requirement, so their final project is featuring an important person at our school (student or adult) that has had a positive impact on them and doing a portrait series of them to go with it.\n\nThe time goes by really quickly and it has been difficult to cover all of the basic principles of photography in such a short time while also taking the students through the writing process. What I tried to do was go over the basics the first week and get every student to take a few shots so -----> -----> I !!!  could develop !!!  the rolls over the weekend. This way the students could be excited about the results, see how their focus is, etc. Then they could plan their portraits over the next two weeks.\n\nI am funding this project myself, so I am bulk rolling Kentmere 400 and developing and scanning at home over the weekend. This, unfortunately, limits the number of times students can photograph, see the results, and learn from their mistakes. I'm currently DSLR scanning with a Lomography Digitaliza, which is great, but I'd like an option to slide a whole roll through to get done more quickly. I'm currently looking for access to a 3D printer so I can print something like u/bradbrok created [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/dy79es/i_designed_a_thing_to_make_dslr_scanning_easier/).\n\nTakeaways:\n\n* Students quickly grasp the concept of shutter speed.

They notice the pattern of the fraction doubling/halving every stop and can articulate that photos are dark because they let in less light and bright because they let in more light.
