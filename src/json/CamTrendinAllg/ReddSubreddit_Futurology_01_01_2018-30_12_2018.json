I will state this here to give a perspective of our past and our future selves.\n\nImagine that you have an implant that allows you to communicate online with all of the knowledge we have accessible to us.  You visit the year 1980.  Back at that time, the closest to the compendium of human knowledge you would encounter would be an encyclopedia; however, if you had access to the Internet and visited that time frame, these people would view you as quite possibly one of the most intelligent people in the world.\n\nThat is, you would have instant access to encyclopedic knowledge about just about everything.  A simple question of who directed any movie, the years wars were fought, the meaning of any word and knowing how to spell it, symptoms for various diseases, and the ability to quote any verse from any religious text.  You could do mathematics and have knowledge of sports.  Now, I am not saying this for the purpose of time travel.  I am saying that in terms of basic knowledge, our ability to access any information at our fingertips (and in my example, interfaced directly into our minds) would make us more than remarkable to people that only know technology from the 1980s.\n\nI say this to compare us to the future of humanity 40 years from now.  Just as we are a giant leap from 1980 to 2020, humans from 2060 will be so advanced of us to appear like geniuses in virtually any field.  So, let us say this future person visits us, and they are just a regular hairless monkey like the rest of us.  However, the augmentation of this person allows them access to answer questions we cannot dream of having instant access to now.\n\nThey see your tattoo, and they are fairly sure you are a writer.  They look at your face, and jewelry, and they know you were born in the year 1992 and the month you were born was in February.  They will not need to know the name of an actor or director.  They can simply see a picture to know their entire filmography.\n\nYou ask them what color to paint the wall of your house for your decor, and they answer with a precise color that will be preferred by at least 75% of all people asked.  They have already diagnosed you with a disease you did not know you had and have recommended a treatment protocol.  A real life Sherlock Holmes is before you.  Even more impressive most likely.\n\nA website design based on a description of what you want.  They may even be able to immediately create a movie of your liking just by you describing what you want to watch.\n\nThis is one of the next steps just after recording and preference guessing.  Just as we have the advantage of knowledge, the future human will have the advantage of application of that knowledge.  All of the heavy mental lifting will be handled by -----> machine learning !!!  algorithms.  It will be able to know your age simply by pattern matching your face.  When you are 60 years old, it will be able to recognize you from a crowd of people based a -----> photo !!!  taken when you were a baby.  It will be able to use sensitive instruments to diagnose illnesses.  Perhaps perform analysis simply by measuring bacteria and viruses while shaking your hand.  It will know your age by your face.  It will guess you were born in February because you are wearing an amethyst stone.  It will be sent a picture of your bedroom and choose the best color to paint it automatically.\n\nThese are the types of advances we will see in the future, and while it might seem incredible to us now, the future human is going to consider it mundane.  They will not need to be smart, but to us now, they would appear as geniuses.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9tgadp/we_are_genius_level_if_we_lived_40_years_ago/"}, {"autor": "Prankster_Bob", "date": "2018-10-07 02:26:27", "content": "When did you realize a lot of the people you're talking to online are -----> AI !!! ? /!/ This idea had long been a joke, but I didn't think -----> AI !!!  were advanced enough to talk like a human being.

To me as an observer of art, as a rule I don't know what the motivations of the artist are. And I bet that most people don't.

Multiple endings are touted as a feature, xyz thousand lines of dialogue and NPCs with behavioural routines to give them a 'daily life' with the aim to seem more life like.\n\nThis creates a very \"theme-park-esque\" style world which when explored via WSAD,  mouse and monitor, may feel full and vibrant, can often feel flat and empty in virtual reality. Modding has fixed this 'empty' feeling to a degree, however the heavy time investment in modding, especially with animations and the limited access modders have to the game, make high quality mods the fewer of the whole. That said, there is probably several hundred high quality mods for skyrim and it's pretty well covered.\n\nStill though, citizens seem like puppets and the world seems very static. \n\nWhen iterated, dialogue is repetative and limited. Gossip, news about town/rumors, local affairs, relationships all feel quite scripted after the first run through and while certain games like the Witcher, ES series and others have done great with making this a focus point, it's still quite lacking.\n\nI would like to be able to have a conversation on any in-universe topic I wish, and if the character has relevant life experience/education, we could talk about it as such. Combat and fighting is again limited by the ability to 'create' enough variations as well as balancing game play. Crafting, gathering, business and the general economic elements of RPG worlds are often quite underwhelming too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand there are trade-offs in game development, and I'm only pointing these out as areas that are *examples* of factors contributing to the empty/lifeless feeling of RPG games. Some do better than others.\n\nThis is all understandable, given the way video games have evolved and the limits of resources when developing new games.\n\nBut what would be required to, for instance, consume the entire canon regarding a particular fictional world (e.g: LoTR, Star Wars, the Marvel or DC universe), and represent it virtually as an explorable, living virtual world. An -----> AI !!!  that 'patches' up the missing areas, and authoring new material that matches the style and flair of the original canon, innovating enough to be interesting yet familiar enough to feel part of the canon. For instance, imagine all of the histories in A Song of Ice &amp; Fire that is unwritten/never to be documented. I believe at some point an -----> AI !!!  could author an entire auxiliary history of ASOIAF that would \"patch\" in with the established canon seamlessly, to the point where GRRM would have difficulty remembering if elements were from his own writing or that of the -----> AI !!!  author.\n\nI've seen technology procedurally generate music and art, I've seen it mimic artistic styles and techniques and convert -----> photo !!! s into paintings in the style of famous artists. I've seen linguistic -----> AI !!! s that can rewrite news articles, describe the scene in a -----> photo !!! , translate in real time between languages etc. There are many other examples of procedural \"art\" and other -----> AI !!!  applications in the creative domain. I don't think it's unbelievable to consider software that could do this, but whether it's 100+ years away, or 10+ years away leaves me wondering.\n\nDo you see any potential solutions that might be feasible in the short term (10-15 years) or is this kind of technology beyond any tangible prediction or estimate?\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8rfn1v/discussion_what_technology_is_required_for_truly/"}, {"autor": "cryptoz", "date": "2018-10-12 21:44:26", "content": "Weather apps in 2018 are a wreck. Most are ad-filled, few offer any innovations and the potential is unlimited. Devices even have weather sensors! What modern tech frustrates you because it isn't being used right? What futuristic apps could be built but nobody has? /!/ There is a lot of talk about weather apps right now, partially because of hurricanes, but also due to outrage over accuweather, and the unpublishing of WT, etc. If you look at the top weather apps I find most of them to be appalling. They almost never attempt a good display of weather data, which is hard; but you'll see entire screen's worth of information to just show empty precip hour by hour. There has got to be a better way to display that information. And often apps will show a 30% chance of precipitation and show a rain icon; but that's misleading since it's likely partly cloudy with a *chance* of rain. I know this can be hard to do, my own weather apps aren't perfect at it, but it's these kinds of improvements we should expect from weather apps today. To be honest the state of weather apps is quite dismal, with some exceptions of course - good weather apps do exist, but there are not many and, in my opinion, they are still not good enough.\n\nA big challenge is to display the right weather data in an easy &amp; fast package to the user. But different people want to see different data at different times, so there are lots of challenges in making just a weather app that displays the same data that everyone else does, but in a better way. It's not easy but there should be more apps trying.\n\nBut I don't want to stop there. With how powerful phones are these days and with how many sensors they have it is such a shame that the phones themselves are not contributing to the weather forecast. \n\n-----\n\n\nI make [All Clear Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android) \n (Android, US-only for now, see below for why) because I demand better of weather apps. Many of the [top weather apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/WEATHER/collection/topselling_free) do nothing but display sometimes-outdated weather data in poorly formatted tables. Frankly the top 20 look exactly the same. I'm making a new weather app because it's 2018 and the category is stagnant. I love the weather and I'm sick of weather apps that don't do anything interesting. Here is what I am passionately dedicated to bringing to a weather app to make it *interesting* and useful at the same time:\n\n1) Your phone probably has a barometer in it! Most Android phones do because Google likes to use it as an altimeter to give you better indoor directions. So with iPhones also having barometers (for the iPhone health app), there are now *billions* of phones around the world are carrying barometers that next to no weather apps are using. Yeah WU and Dark Sky have a toggle, but what does it do? Do they talk about how they are using the sensor data? I don't think so. With All Clear you can at least *see* the sensor data from the weather sensors in your phone and *know* that it is being analyzed and processed into 'virtual weather stations' so it can be eventually included in the main weather models. You'll know this because you'll be able to see it happen in the app as I make progress. Here is a [quick graph I made](https://imgur.com/gallery/IPj6w7N) of Hurricane Florence's pressure recorded by phones in North Carolina a few weeks ago. It may take some imagination to see how the data could be useful (it needs cleaning, privacy protection, quality control, etc) but you can *see* the data in there and I know it can be extracted into useful numerical weather model inputs.\n\n2) All the phones in the world have cameras. These cameras are taking -----> photo !!! s of the sky and the weather all day long but nobody is using this data in weather forecasting. That's obviously because it is difficult to extract meaningful numeric weather data from a -----> photo !!! , but I believe it can be done. All Clear has a feature to let users send in -----> photo !!! s of the sky with tags, and I am going to use this data as a training data set to a -----> machine learning !!!  classifier. If it works, it should be able to automatically tag weather information in *any* outdoor -----> photo !!!  - assuming the training dataset is good and my ML is good.\n\n3) Current conditions in a lot of weather apps are out of date, since the source data is out-of-date. A lot of the US MADIS stations update only hourly, and they can miss updating in intervals when significant weather happens. Sometimes they update and sometimes they don't. But I think it's so frustrating to look outside and see it is raining while your weather app just happily denies the existence of that rain and tells you it's just partly cloudy. So I let you fix it, for yourself and for others nearby. If enough people all submit the same weather condition, contrary to the station reports, the app will start showing that condition as the Truth for current conditions in that area. (safeguards built in to protect against cheating).\n\n4) I'm sick of the same UI in all the weather apps. I get that the UI in All Clear isn't perfect yet (it's a new project! and it's a hobby! and I'm not a UI designer!) but I am absolutely going to try new things in terms of *how* the optimal weather data can be displayed to a user to maximize quick-check understanding. It's too easy to be misled by the text, icons, and gridded numbers in most weather apps.\n\n5) I am dedicated to open source. While the whole app isn't open source yet (it will be!) the main sensor code that does the barometric pressure data collection along with other sensors, is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/JacobSheehy/AllClearSensorLibrary). I would encourage other weather app developers to enable features in their apps to aide in the crowdsourcing of potentially very useful weather data that is otherwise idle in phones. \n\n6) It's in the details. The US NOAA Forecast API that the app uses only returns its text forecasts with F and mi built-in as units. I wrote an algorithm (regexes mostly) to convert the text forecast units on-the-fly so you can be reading it and see it as C and km if you like, it's seamless. Well there is one error I know about, sometimes it will say \"quarter of an inch of rain\" which is a bit of a pain to parse, but I'm working on that too! \n\nAnother detail worth mentioning is the smart retry. During development I discovered that the API returned errors (or didn't return at all) and so rather than just showing the user a failure screen, the API does a nice backoff-retry to try really really hard to get the data for you. And if it can't do that? It knows that probably that forecast office or station is just *down*. So it changes the location parameters a bit and tries again, hoping to catch a different station forecast that would still be relevant to you. I don't have the numbers for how often it fails to load vs. other weather apps (I hope it's not worse!). But I know this: I put in some serious effort to try my best to show you the weather no matter what. On that topic...\n\n7) Another feature of the app is that it does a lot of work to attempt to pick accurate icons. I find that the icons shown in a lot of weather apps are misleading at best when it comes to describing the weather. It turns out that it's really hard to show the user the right weather information in just an icon. So this is the main reason for the animations in the app: to make the visuals more correct and more engaging. There is logic in the app to not show the default icon that comes from the weather API: if it did do that, then a 30% chance of thunderstorms shows you just the thunderstorm icon. Most apps do this. But chances are? The weather will be just partly cloudy, no thunderstorms. So the app shows a partly cloudy animation with a faded, flashing lightning bolt to indicate the probability. Further work is being done in future updates to the app to make this even more accurate.\n\n-----\n\nAlright, there's what All Clear can do that other weather apps can't. Maybe it should be your next weather app but maybe it is missing a critical feature for you. **What's that feature?** What do you need or want in a weather app that nobody is delivering today?\n \nAll of that above featureset is free by the way. Part of the problem with not enough original and quality weather apps is that they each cost money to run and users are often unwilling to pay. So for All Clear it is free to use all the features of the app; You can pay $1/month if you like to extend the forecasts from 3 days to 6, and extend other features in the app like the number of visible weather pictures (from 10 to 100). The subscription will help pay for the servers that run all the custom weather data code as well as future development of neat weather experiments using smartphone sensors. \n\nHere's the link to All Clear again: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android\n\nAnd a note about it being US-only. I tried to make this international from the get-go, and wasted months using IBM's API from WU that barely worked at all. Then they yanked the payment form off the web the week I was going to publish the app and buy their $400/month package. No longer an option. Now you have to wait for a phone call, might be weeks, and the prices are like $3,000 for the equivalent data (or something, hard to say). If you want to read some of the drama about this, check out this [WeatherUnderground thread](https://apicommunity.wunderground.com/weatherapi/topics/weather-underground-api-changes)  where people are describing the confusion as WU cuts off their keys and makes the service dramatically more expensive.\n\nSo the app is using the US NOAA data for free and I am investigating alternatives for international weather data.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9nogje/weather_apps_in_2018_are_a_wreck_most_are/"}, {"autor": "KadaBen", "date": "2018-09-24 15:10:50", "content": "You wanna know why -----> AI !!!  will kill us...

If you think I'm mistaken and there must be corrections, tell me :)\n\n*******\n\n2020s\n\nDeep Learning and other machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple. It's not hard to write them down into bizarre math but this simplicity negatively correlates with the ability of a human mind to understand what happens as a whole inside this kind of software. In the same way, we can't enumerate all the reasons why we love so much this guy/girl or why we like to play guitar solos. I mean, we can guess some reasons but the overall cognitive process remains a mystery for our \"limited Consciousness\". I guess there's a point there, maybe only the tip of the iceberg must be visible in order to be able to use such monstrous computer power representing our Subconscious. \n\nToday, science says that the cortex is composed of separated and statict modules made of hierarchized layers of neurons so connections can change between these modules (neuroplasticity). Sounds like sociology don't you think? The fact is that our unified experience is a sum of unchanging and very similar units interacting in a dynamic and adaptable way, but for sure more shit is happening there... \n\nThis modules then form specialized regions able to do things like riding a bike or be an expert on something. What's the problem with this? Maybe it's not very obvious but, what if we can have the best possible specialized region able to everybody instead of having to rely on others brain regions (let me explain)? Today there are -----> AI !!!  apps able to do in seconds what a human takes decades of work and some luck to be the best. I\u2019m talking about apps that can detect skin diseases or tumors in X-rays better than the best doctors in the world combined or to drive with 0 mistakes in a F1 race. What I\u2019m saying is, why should I rely on a single person instead of accessing the best one with less limitations? This is the true revolution: now there\u2019s no need for armies of humans trying to be available and good, with one single app we can do it the best way and make it ubicous. We are unifying expertise and learning in a few single entities.\n\nBut, why aren\u2019t these apps available now? I like to think that with integrated circuits we achieved to mimic those brain modules but we were unable to link them in a dynamic and organic way. Now we have this three things: powerful -----> AI !!!  GPUs, the Internet and Neural Algorithms. Sounds like the best context. There\u2019s only one limitation: this [one](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MooresLaw2.png). We need more Titan V chips, more silicon into the equation and, of course it must be a lot more cheap. I\u2019m not sure when, because I don\u2019t know how to do the maths (ask Nvidia, Intel, AMD\u2026) but I\u2019ll bet that by the end of the next decade, we will have a lot of this weak -----> AI !!!  apps as services, products etc. A legal problem? Let\u2019s look for a good app\u2026 Oh yeah, this one uses -----> AI !!! \u2026 \u201cIs this contract legally valid?\u201d; \u201cA cop is saying me that I can\u2019t use my -----> camera !!! \u201d; \u201cMy boss said me that\u2026\u201d. Answer: \u201c Ok, Will, (I have used a giant -----> AI !!!  server to read billions of cases, documents etc, I\u2019ve even read the full paper you\u2019re talking about, I\u2019ve compared it to other\u2019s users cases and documents maintaining legal secret, I\u2019ve done all the stuff that requires 1 billion years to do by 1 billion \u201cbest\u201d lawyers in just 6 seconds) This clause is invalid so you can cancell your relations with this agent. Best approach considering my database is to\u2026\u201d. I mean you get what I mean. OMG I\u2019m wrinting too much\u2026\n\nSo, by 2029 we will live in a world were specialized intelligence is the best possible, ubicous, cheap and fast as light (with AR glasses fuck yeah!). BUT, the sum of all these weak -----> AI !!! \u2026 No! We can\u2019t link them in order to make a human mind! Or\u2026 can we?\n\n*****\n\n2030s\n\nNow, after all the shit you\u2019ve read (sorry for that), I\u2019ll make my main point: we will achieve Super -----> AI !!!  (ASI)/ god like -----> AI !!!  before or at the same time we reach AGI (human level -----> AI !!!  / General) and this is gonna happen in the 30s if, and only if, the same step of making posible dynamic communication between \u201cmodules\u201d in order to create \u201c expertise regions\u201d is made at a region level. How can we do this? I don\u2019t know but as I said in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7b1quc/the_10_years_cycle/), it\u2019s very likely to neural links to be a thing. So, imagine a world where we have the best specific intelligent apps possible in the cloud and we can connect our mammal brains to them via brain wifi. It\u2019s very hard to imagine, I know, but I\u2019ll make a bet again.\n\nI want to think that progress is congruent: things happen if the context allows it. So, I think ASI will be a thing at the same time we connect our brains to it. We will build this new God as a part of us, not a separated one, we will be this God and I can\u2019t wait for feeling that orgasm.\n\n********\n\nThanks for reading, this is a shitpost in the sense that I\u2019m not an expert on anything and I just like to think about useless stuff xD I hope you enjoyed [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNCEj6D8CAM)!\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8kostp/ai/"}, {"autor": "SolidVegetable", "date": "2018-10-01 11:22:49", "content": "White engineers = racist -----> AI !!! ? /!/ \"Sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are being built into the machine-learning algorithms that underlie the technology behind many \u201cintelligent\u201d systems that shape how we are categorized and advertised to.\n\nTake a small example from last year: Users discovered that Google\u2019s -----> photo !!!  app, which applies automatic labels to pictures in digital -----> photo !!!  albums, was classifying images of black people as gorillas.

For example, let's say that a main character has a friend and that friends dies but then is brought back to life. This is a scenario that we just can't experience. But what if you were put in the shoes of that main character and your brain was subtly tricked to feel the way \"you're supposed to feel\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes when I play a game or watch a movie I;m actually disappointed with myself that I don't feel the way I want to. Sometimes I want to be in awe when something glorious and magnificent happens and sometimes I want to feel sad, but often I'm just in a bad mood, or maybe some background noises distracts me. This is why I think an option to influence our feelings would be very appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou'd also be able to regulate the dose of specific emotions and sensations. For example if you wish to you'll be able to get rid of pain, fear, but if you want a more realistic experience with less tricks you can just leave them as they're supposed to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother feature would be that you could either choose whether -----> AI !!!  does the simulation purely on its own or if it's allowed to analize your brain to see how you aleady visualize this world and use it as a support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI make some assumptions here:  \n\n\nComputer graphics will improve to the point where it's impossible for a human to discern between real and artificial image.  \n\n\nFully immersive virtual reality will be created.

This is probably going to happen anyway. With those enhancements it would likely be possible to simulate long periods of time in such a way that only minutes pass in real world.  \n2. We won't have anything better to do than virtual reality so we will spend our lives there anyway. Look, the real world is cool, but virtual world will allow us to become gods. It's imaginable that majority of humans will choose to spend their lives in perfect vitual words instead of real ones. This may sound creepy now but this almost certainly will happen.  There are already individuals spending their whole time in virtual worlds despite of how crappy and unrealstic they're in comparison to what I talk about so it's really a matter of time. I think it can happen before the end of this century. After all, think about what -----> AI !!!  can do using only one PC or one supercomputer. Now think about the processing power of the entire world. What if all of it, all smartphones, supercomputers, laptops, what if all were combined and working on just one project? What could we possibly achieve assuming no performance loss? Now imagine that in 40 years a box the size of your PC will feature more processing power than the entire world currently combined and then the same thing will likely happen in the next 40 years... well, I think this may just do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9goq8l/in_the_future_ai_will_be_able_to_turn_any/"}, {"autor": "ShmickleShmock", "date": "2018-02-24 13:45:47", "content": "Is strong -----> AI !!!  loose on the internet? /!/ Everybody has seen ads based on things they've searched, things they've mentioned that their phone mic has picked up, or things their -----> camera !!!  has seen.   \nI have seen one or two ads for things I have only THOUGHT about.
