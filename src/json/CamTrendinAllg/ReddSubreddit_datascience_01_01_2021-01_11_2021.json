Everyone was convinced it worked, but basically under the hood it just looked for lines, and wrinkles and since we were all white and asian that is what it used as reference, and it guessed our age pretty accurate. When I got a darker skin student who's lines were less noticeable under the light, it wouldn't reliably work. I just remembered being worried if that was put into some other system to authenticate age etc and how it would fail for certain people, even if technically the math worked out and it mostly worked for a large amount of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow come there isn't more research into some sort heuristic(instead of speed it solves for bias) algorithms or theoretical equation(Think time complexity but bias complexity) that can identify a model and it's inefficiencies or potential biases and generate a better model without human interaction to atleast give a counterpoint to fallible humans. I spent a few hours(ive been up ince 3 writing code for work) looking at scholar articles about this and their seems to be no real research going into this. All I see is a few data scientists sounding the alarm to an ignorant public that can't do HS algebra, let alone understand advance statistical methods.

How do I transition into a Tech Company? /!/ In the past few years, I finished school with a statistics degree (bachelor), taught myself programming (Python, R, shell scripting), built portfolio on data analysis, data visualization and statistical analysis, worked as a programmer/math assistant at a lab for about a year during school, worked as a data analyst intern for about 4-5 months towards end of school and now working as a quantitative analyst for a government organization a little over a year (my \"first real job\" after graduation). Recently, I've been focusing on applying jobs at tech companies and reaching out to people (including recruiters) on LinkedIn for networking. For most of the application, I wrote a tailored cover letter and cv (one page summarizing my work exp - about 3 years in total - as well as 3-4 personal projects) and reached out to people who work at those companies for insights. I've been doing everything I could to improve my chances of getting interviews, but was not successful (I've gotten only one phone interview recently but was rejected for a data analyst role because I was less experienced compared to other candidates).\n\nI've been feeling depressed at my current work. I find myself restricted from doing more data science-related projects due to bureaucracy and office politics. I like taking initiatives and going out my way to improve things (like inefficiencies in data transfer, analysis, etc.) but noticed that colleagues are tech-averse and hate changes (even if it provides more efficiency), which doesn't offer a lot of learning/growing opportunities - everything that I stand against - and I don't see myself being at this company long-term. I have a strong interest in ecommerce and have been applying to companies (big and small/startup) related to it but I feel that recruiters may be biased against my non-engineering degree, the fact that I don't have 4 co-op internships and that I work at a government (I've been told by someone who works as a recruiter at a very well known ecommerce company that when they see someone working at gov't, they just throw out their cv). \n\nI spend most of my evenings after work applying to jobs, networking online, learning new data science skills, and working on personal projects (currently working on a raspberry pi project with motion sensor and -----> camera !!!  so that I can detect this outdoors kitty in my neighbourhood using -----> machine learning !!!  - image recognition with CNN - and send mobile notification so I can pet kitty everyday). I think I'm doing everything I can but not seeing much progress. I'm starting to wonder if there's something that I'm not doing enough or if I should go back to school with co-op option or do some bootcamp with a job guarantee just so I get my foot in the door and have a better chance transitioning into a tech company. Any advice?\n\nAlso, I'm not necessarily looking for \"you should try Udemy/Coursera/\\[insert some bootcamp for beginners\\]\" unless you have a fantastic recommendation - I am already using DataCamp for learning. If you have similar experiences as me or is someone working as a senior/recruiter hiring for data-related roles and can give an honest opinion of how I can make my application stronger, I'd appreciate it :) Cheers", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nbjp1g/help_i_work_at_a_government_how_do_i_transition/"}, {"autor": "OnlyProggingForFun", "date": "2021-01-23 15:32:51", "content": "THE -----> AI !!! -POWERED ONLINE FITTING ROOM: VOGUE.

Of course, it's not up to par with MIT but most people compare it to Northeastern University. I'm from the Boston area so it's easy to get to their campus if needed.\n\nI have a BA in CS minoring in math in undergrad and I attended a small private university. I'm currently working full-time as a Data Engineer at a consulting company in NYC that piggybacks off of bigger firms such as Microsoft and Accenture. My current and past projects have used Python, SQL, Azure, GCP, big data pipelines with Pyspark, Spark, Databricks, Data lakes, Snowflake, Big Query and Power BI.\n\nMy plan is to stay at this company for about 3 more years and finish a masters online while working. Probably a pace of one course a semester is manageable for me. That way I can gain experience in many different industries solving real world data problems and move my way up in the company as I get a master's. Then the plan is to apply to bigger companies and maybe some FAANG or MSFT in the Boston and NYC area.\n\nFor flexibility I would like to do a master's degree online and fortunately, cost is not a concern. I was accepted to the online MS DS program at WPI. They're one of the few schools to have a PhD in data science as well (but not interested in that currently)!\n\nWhen doing some research it seems like there are other good programs out there as well like Georgia tech's OMSCS and OMSA, UC Berkeley's MIDS, Northwestern's MS DS, John Hopkins' MS DS, and University of Illinois' MCS DS. Are there any others that I'm forgetting? Will it really benefit me to go to one of these \"bigger name\" programs instead of WPI?\n\nAlso content wise, what should I be looking for in a DS program? What I'm currently looking for out of a program is building critical thinking skills, the competitive -----> lense !!!  for solving data problems as they apply to the business, to fill in the gaps learning some basic -----> machine learning !!!  algorithms (I learned many SWE algorithms in undergrad and even took NLP, but don't have much practice/experience with building data models and ML algorithms), networking opportunities and the master's degree title for a manager position/salary boost.\n\nOut of SWE, DS, ML, BI, data visualization and DE, I enjoy DE the most and especially constructing and optimizing big data pipelines/cleaning and preparing data! But I don't want to make the mistake of locking myself into one area career-wise either especially because job market changes and inevitable (over the next 3 years).\n\nAs a job applicant with about 3-4 projected years of experience with DE, some BI development, visualization and reporting as a business tech consultant, does it really matter where you go to graduate school for a MS DS if you just want to be a data engineer, manager and/or a tech lead one day?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox87tz/does_it_really_matter_where_you_go_to_graduate/"}, {"autor": "ptoews", "date": "2021-09-21 16:19:15", "content": "Choosing a setup: GPU count vs. per-GPU memory /!/ We are finalizing our plans for a -----> deep learning !!!  machine but are unsure about the best GPU choice. It will be used on -----> camera !!!  image and point cloud data in parallel with a few classification heads, so the network will be rather large (but still as small/fast as possible).\n\nWe can either get 3x (Quadro) RTX A6000 or 6x RTX 3090 for the same price. According to benchmarks, the 3090 based setup should be about 1.8x faster. On the other hand, the A6000 has double the memory per GPU which allows larger batch sizes per GPU. However I'm not sure how big of an advantage this is compared to the distributed batching with multiple GPUs (data parallelism).\n\nAnother possibility is of course to parallelize experiments, however I don't think there will be running more that two experiments at the same time that often. So data parallelism would come into play either way.\n\nAnother topic is of course power and thermal management. We would use a crypto-style open rig for the 6x setup, for the 3x one the mainboard is able to take them all. However we would probably need two PSUs with the 6x setup. PCIe lanes should be no problem as we have 128 of them.\n\nWhich of the two options would be more effective for this task? Would the 3090 setup be too limiting for large models or increase workflow complexity?
