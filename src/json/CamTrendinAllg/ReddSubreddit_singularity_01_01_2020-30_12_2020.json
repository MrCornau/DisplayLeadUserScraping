If people are interested I'll keep going with more.\n\nSome notes before we begin. First, I stayed away from predictions that had an indefinite or wide range of time (for example, there's one section on the predictions page labelled \"2020 - 2050\" and another labelled \"the early 2000's\"). Obviously it's meaningless to rate the latter because it's not precise, and meaningless to rate the former because we're only part way through 2020 at the time of this writing. Next, we're going to count any prediction as accurate if it happens within two or three years of the prediction year. I think this is fair given the difficulty of predicting future tech trends and given the fact that many of his critics said at the time of his predictions that these technologies would not be available until decades after his prediction dates, if at all. Also, I stuck mostly to predictions made about the early 2020's (for which I include 2019 as this is within a couple years). For each prediction I include an explanation and verdict, but for some I also include an explanation (esp. if the verdict was inconclusive). And I also skipped predictions that were extremely similar or derivative of previous predictions (to save space). Lastly, each section is labelled by the book to which it belongs next to which I put the year the book was written. \n\nWithout further ado we'll start with *The Age of Spiritual Machines*:\n\n##The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999):##\n\n**Prediction:** The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the human brain (20 quadrillion calculations per second).\n\n**Verdict:** Inconclusive. \n\n**Explanation:** The problem with this is that it can have many different interpretations. With the advent of tensor cores and -----> ML !!!  it's difficult to say whether we've reached a point where a computer has the essential *computational* capacity of the human brain. In order to prove definitively that a machine has the hardware to run human brain level software, we'd need human brain software (AGI). So no matter what we do we will only really know in retrospect once we have achieved that. \n\nOn top of this, I could not find a straight answer to this question no matter where I looked or what numbers I crunched. It was difficult even to establish precisely how much computational power you can buy for 6,300 usd ($4000 usd circa 1999). In reality this deserves its own post. I may do so at another time if no one else is interested. \n\n\n**Prediction**: The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.\n\n**Verdict:** Inconclusive. Difficult to determine this, esp if things like phones, game systems, and smart televisions count as \"computers\". See above.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).\n\n**Verdict:** True. [Smart rings](https://www.wareable.com/fashion/best-smart-rings-1340), watches, picture frames, [smart furniture](https://www.wayfair.com/keyword.php?keyword=smart+recliner) , [smart clothing](https://www.wareable.com/smart-clothing/levi-commuter-trucker-jacket-2-google-price-release-date-specs-7657) are all in existence and have been for some time.\n\n\n**Prediction:** People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.\n\n**Verdict:** Yes. VR is obviously here with the Second generation being announced just recently (Oculus Quest 2). As for contact lenses read [this](https://www.fastcompany.com/90441928/the-making-of-mojo-ar-contact-lenses-that-give-your-eyes-superpowers). They're probably another year or two off, essentially correct by the standards laid out above.\n\n\n**Prediction:** People communicate with their computers via two-way speech and gestures instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.\n\n**Verdict:** True. Every time you swipe on a touch screen, whether you're unlocking your phone with a gesture code or scrolling up with your thumb, that's gestures. As for the second part, well, I'd say Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa have fairly different (and customizable) personalities.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.\n\n**Verdict:** Sort of. It depends on what you mean by \"simulated person.\" We know he doesn't mean an advanced, human-like A.I. because his prediction for that is a decade hence. So a series of pages with which you select things you want to buy might count as a \"simulated cashier\" for example, as the interaction you have with it is much the same. Definitely debatable, but I think this one's grey. \n\n\n**Prediction:** Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a \"computer\" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.\n\n**Verdict:** Yes. Smart phones, laptops, tablets, Nintendo Switches... I don't think we'll have many arguments here.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.\n\n**Verdict:** Yes, mostly. There *are* wireless mice, keyboards, speakers, etc. Technically you *could* have an entirely wireless setup. Moreover, if you look at it from a percentage perspective, this is the case for most devices and most people (more laptop owners and phone owners than dedicated graphics PC owners). \n\n\n**Prediction:** Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.\n\n**Verdict:** Wrong. Ray put himself in a corner, here. If he had said: \"rotating computer hard drives are almost entirely gone\" then he would have been right. Again, this has to be seen from a percentage vantage point when taking all \"computers\" into account. \n\n\n**Prediction:** Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.\n\n**Verdict:** Wrong. They just became possible, but it likely won't be until mid to late decade until they become dominant, if ever: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/processors/modern-microprocessor-built-using-carbon-nanotubes.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.\n\n**Verdict:** Essentially right. Remember, Ray was talking in 1999 terms. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other forms of A.I. weren't in the public consciousness. But they are the children of parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.\n\n**Verdict:** Difficult to tell. Outside of companies like Open AI their studies and methods of development have been mostly secret. That's why Open AI was made in the first place. I'll betting there's a lot of this going on behind closed doors, however.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Pinhead-sized -----> camera !!! s are everywhere.\n\n**Verdict:** Yes. The -----> camera !!!  in most phones and laptops is close to being pinhead sized (especially if you don't count the casing of the -----> camera !!! ). Compared to 1999 they could be considered to be \"everywhere\".\n\n\n**Prediction:** Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. \"Nanoengineered machines\" begin to be used in manufacturing.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. It [does exist](https://www.nanotech-now.com/current-uses.htm), but isn't in mainstream use. There are some medical applications being researched as well. https://phys.org/news/2020-08-nanoengineered-biosensors-early-disease.html\n\nThis is the end for part one of my review of Ray Kurzweil's predictions for 2020 as they stand.
