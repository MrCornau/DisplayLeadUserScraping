The root of all the technology and its applications emerges from human needs. The same is with the \"PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor\", and PiXL Document Reader\". The idea of these two products arises from our financial sector client's needs. The \n\n# The story begins here...\n\nWe are in a time where the technologies enable machines to simulate and augment human intelligence. Banking sectors are also inside the circle of intelligence age or else within a short time we can see a drastic change in financial services especially in manual works. They are the world of computers and networks that store the world economy in databases. PixDynamics had a trusted relationship with a prominent bank where they find difficulties in KYC form extraction and classification. Banks are the place where they handle a bulk of paper documents. We have to submit our proofs say Adhar cards, voters ID or any other means of Id proofs. This had to be entered into the system by a bank employee. Imagine how difficult it is to do these works manually. This is a practice that had been followed for years. Even though we address banks are in the path of -----> AI !!! , a lot of manual works are still an ongoing process. This gives us the idea of \"PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor\", and PiXL Document reader \". Our developing team developed the product under DL and ML proficiency. After implementing the product our client bank classify and extracts the documents with less time and thus gets the documents scanned with 99 percent accuracy. And now we had a trusted relationship with a couple of banks where they realize the product's efficiency and quality.\n\nIt was a hard work of one and a half years effect within the hands of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. The flow of the project was \n\n**Data collection -&gt; Train the system -&gt; Optimization**\n\nThe first real step to train our system is **gathering data**. This step is very important because the quality and quantity of data that you gather will directly determine how good your predictive model can be. A few hours of measurements later, we have gathered our training data. Now it\u2019s time for the next step of machine learning: **Data preparation**, where we load our data into a suitable place and prepare it for use in our machine learning training. Now we move onto what is often considered the bulk of machine learning \u2014 the T**raining**. In this step, we will use our data to incrementally improve our model\u2019s ability to predict whether a given drink is wine or beer. Once training is complete, it\u2019s time to see if the model is any good, using **Evaluation**. This is where that dataset that we set aside earlier comes into play. Evaluation allows us to test our model against data that has never been used for training.\n\n# Our Products................\n\n#### PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor\n\n-----> AI !!! -based solution specially designed to address KYC form extraction and classification issue, faced by the financial organizations in recent times.
