She just tested the shutter and film advance and said they're functioning, but she hasn't put a roll of film in and developed it, so can't give any more info than that on functionality (e.g. shutter clearing). Lens is clean, cosmetics are pretty decent (minor scuffs, a bit of the wrap peeled away). She hasn't used it in a while, but she still pulls it out regularly and works the shutter and film advance to make sure they don't seize up. She's told me she doesn't want to part /w the body, lens, and accessories for any less than $1500 all told, but obviously feel free to make offers and I'll pass them along. Let us know if you have further questions and if you had advice on testing further for functionality, we'd accept it. I just sold my first camera to [u/interesting\\_material](https://www.reddit.com/u/interesting_material/) if you want a reference.\n\nEdit: Looked up serials on request of someone.
