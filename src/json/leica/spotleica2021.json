My favorite time to shoot is when traveling.\n* Q2 was my first Leica, it's about a year old now and mint.

They're growing on me, but I do find composition more difficult than shooting with an SLR. I will be sad to say goodbye to the amazing EVF on the Q2.\n* I don't feel I need the M10-R because 40mp is not important to me. Same with the Q2, I won't miss the 47mp too much because I'll be able to go between a 28, 35, and 50 on my M10 and I don't feel the added resolution is important since I am mostly making small prints or zines.
