And is Leica for me at all? /!/ Leica. It's a name that so many know, but an item which relatively few ever get their hands on. I got into photography around 2008/9 and remember attending a big show where I held my first Leica. I didn't know anything about anything at that point, but knew that what I was holding was special, at least as far as inanimate objects-- especially cameras-- go. It was markedly better feeling than any other camera I'd owned/held up until that point. There's people out there who equate weight and rigidity to quality-- heavier the better-- and I get that. I handled a Pentax 67 that same day and while it was undoubtedly solid, it didn't exude the same level of finesse as the Leica. Truth be told, I don't think I've ever held an item in any category which felt as good/high quality. For years I toyed with the idea of one, but without the ability to try before buying I just couldn't pull the trigger on such an expensive item. \n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago when I visited the Leica store in Vienna. I finally got to spend some hands-on time with an M6 and it felt just as incredible as whatever M-series it was I held a decade earlier. It handled so beautiful and completely flawlessly. After only a few minutes with it, I seemed to be completely dialled in and one with the camera- it was like an extension of me. Focusing was an absolute joy. I was sorely tempted to pick up that M6 with a matching 50mm, but a quick eBay search showed me I could find one substantially cheaper back home in North America, so I waited. \n\nJust today I picked up my dream camera-- a Hasselblad 503cw--, which reignited my love for analog photography. I previously used to shoot a Mamiya RZ67 Pro II and Sinar F1, but sold them a few years ago as the expedited workflow of digital hijacked all my attention. Now with the Hasselblad by my side I'd like a great 35mm counterpart and of course it only seems natural that a Leica be it. I'm trying to be as objective as possible about this and figure out if a Leica even has any place in my arsenal in the first place... I'm a fashion-portrait photographer, shooting 50/50 studio/location. I generally prefer shooting 85mm (in full frame/35mm), but am thinking the Leica might be better for more 'environmental' portrait work where you bring more of the surroundings into the frame. \n\nAlso, I know there's no shortage of threads on the subject, but could someone perhaps give me a brief summary regarding the different analog M-series cameras. I'll likely go the M6 route, but am curious how the MP compares. Is it better in any way? I don't really understand the price difference. Also, which magnification M6 is best to get? What's standard? I know people love the double stroke M3's, but I'd really prefer something newer. Also, which are the best/most popular lenses?
