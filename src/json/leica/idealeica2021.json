After years of wanting to get into film photography I\u2019m finally in a position to dabble a bit but I\u2019m still very new. I bought a Pentax K1000 that came with its traditional lens but I was always enchanted with the Leica iiif, and after some eBay shopping I was finally able to snag one in good condition. However the lens it came with is a Nikkor 135 (https://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/nikkoresources/RF-Nikkor/RF135mm/index1.htm)\n\nLuckily it came with a viewfinder for that length and also one for 35mm for some reason.\n\nMy question is this: I\u2019ve been told I should probably get a 50mm lens since 135 is mostly for portrait and I really would like to do street/landscape/and nature so a 50mm lens would be good. I like the idea of a collapsible lens since it would make the camera a little easier to transport, but the Summicron and Summitars are pretty pricey. I intend for this new lens to be my daily driver so I\u2019ve seen forums where they say they\u2019re more collector items and something like a 50 Elmar 3.5 lens would be better. I\u2019ve also seen YouTube reviews by Matt Osborne who likes the Cannon 50 f/1.8 LTM lens a lot. I guess my question is what do you all recommend for someone starting off but a lens that will grow with me? I can\u2019t afford a Summicron but am willing to spring for a Summitar if that gives a general idea of price point.\n\nAlso, any thoughts on wide range? Is that a lens I would need for nature or landscape? I included info on the K1000 because maybe I could use both cameras for different things?\n\nThank you all!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/nrs02m/help_with_beginner_ltm_lens/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "leica", "result": true, "Selector": "[idea, make]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "Help with beginner LTM lens /!/ Hi all!
