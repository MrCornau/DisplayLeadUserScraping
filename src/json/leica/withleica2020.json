So far I love it. It's small, takes beautiful pictures, and I love all around the building quality of the camera. \n\nI do have a question, however, about recording on the CL. Two things:\n\n1. I noticed when I want to record in 4k30fps, the camera crops the image? Why is this? Is this a setting in have yet to find? If I shoot in any lower quality I get an uncropped image. \n\n2. The camera doesn't come with audio jack, so I have to come up with a work around. Is there anything anyone would recommend when it comes to mics, or anything for audio? \n\nI love street photography and vlogging, so recording is a big one for me, but the rest of Leica's lineup doesn't really align with what I'm looking for, which is compact. \n\nThanks", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/jbllj4/question_about_recording_video_with_cl/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "leica", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "question about recording video with cl /!/ hello,\n\ni'm still new to using leica, with my cl being my first, and only having it a few days. so far i love it. it's small, takes beautiful pictures, and i love all around the building quality of the camera. \n\ni do have a question, however, about recording on the cl. two things:\n\n1. i noticed when i want to record in 4k30fps, the camera crops the image? why is this? is this a setting in have yet to find? if i shoot in any lower quality i get an uncropped image. \n\n2. the camera doesn't -----> come !!!  -----> with !!!  audio jack, so i have to -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  a work around. is there anything anyone would recommend when it comes to mics, or anything for audio? \n\ni love street photography and vlogging, so recording is a big one for me, but the rest of leica's lineup doesn't really align with what i'm looking for, which is compact. \n\nthanks", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 11548, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "mark_paterson", "date": "2020-08-26 19:33:17", "content": "I came up with a cheap and effective solution to stop my strap rings scratching my Q2 body.
