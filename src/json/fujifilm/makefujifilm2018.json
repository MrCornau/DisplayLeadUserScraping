I LOVE the Fuji system and images I am getting.\n\nMy main reason for switching was that I would never take my D7100 with me and when I did it was an \u2018event\u2019 due to it\u2019s size and bag. That ..and PRICE .. was why I went with the X-T20. \n\nFast forward to today and while I am very happy with the XT20, I have had to make some tweaks for it to fit my hand well. I have added the half-grip from Fuji (it\u2019s quirk is it blocks in-camera charging), a wrist strap and I have a Lensmate thumb grip on the way.\n\nSo while I have my \u2018small\u2019 solution .. I have had to work to make it work.\n\nI will say I like the touchscreen but I prefer to change focus points with the camera to my eye so the joystick works better. I tried it on an X100F and really liked it. I didn\u2019t have to \u2018menu\u2019 in for it to work.. I just moved the joystick and bam.. nice.\n\nNow it seems that the price of the XT20 has come down significantly. I can find new for under $1,300 and used in great shape for about $1,000. I estimate I can get around $800 for my XT20 kit but I lose the zoom lens.\n\nIn this case.. what are the thoughts here on selling the XT20 and going to the XT2 if I can do it for under $400?\n\nAlso, how close are we to an XT3 as that may drive my decision?\n\nMy wife and I are going to Italy in August so I would like to have the best option I can for that trip.\n\nThank you for any feedback and guidance you can provide.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/8g9o1q/upgrade_to_xt2_advice/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "fujifilm", "result": true, "Selector": "i have had to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "upgrade to xt-2.. advice. /!/ i know this has been debated all over the information superhighway but was hoping to get some current perspective here.\n\ni sold my nikon d7100 and lenses recently and moved to the fuji system, x-t20, 16-50 and 23 f2. i love the fuji system and images i am getting.\n\nmy main reason for switching was that i would never take my d7100 with me and when i did it was an \u2018event\u2019 due to it\u2019s size and bag. that ..and price .. was why i went with the x-t20. \n\nfast forward -----> to !!!  today and while -----> i !!!  am very happy with the xt20, -----> i !!!  -----> have !!!  -----> had !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  some tweaks for it -----> to !!!  fit my hand well. i have added the half-grip from fuji (it\u2019s quirk is it blocks in-camera charging), a wrist strap and i have a lensmate thumb grip on the way.\n\nso while i have my \u2018small\u2019 solution .. i have had to work to make it work.\n\ni will say i like the touchscreen but i prefer to change focus points with the camera to my eye so the joystick works better. i tried it on an x100f and really liked it. i didn\u2019t have to \u2018menu\u2019 in for it to work.. i just moved the joystick and bam.. nice.\n\nnow it seems that the price of the xt20 has come down significantly. i can find new for under $1,300 and used in great shape for about $1,000. i estimate i can get around $800 for my xt20 kit but i lose the zoom lens.\n\nin this case.. what are the thoughts here on selling the xt20 and going to the xt2 if i can do it for under $400?\n\nalso, how close are we to an xt3 as that may drive my decision?\n\nmy wife and i are going to italy in august so i would like to have the best option i can for that trip.\n\nthank you for any feedback and guidance you can provide.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 75, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "isolerphoto", "date": "2018-06-12 20:12:51", "content": "A mini-documentary series shot on X-H1 and X-T2. /!/ Hey folks,\n\nI just finished the first episode of a docu\\-series about career transitions.

Currently, my bag usually contains a D610, a 35 f/1.8 (this lens is on the camera about 80% of the time), a 70-300VR, and a Tokina 16-28 f/2.8. It does everything I need, but after hiking a couple miles up a steep hill with that bag I'm about ready to throw it into a river. Now that tax returns are coming, I'm looking to make the jump and save my future self some back pain. Below is what I'm looking at to fill the roles of my current gear with something smaller and lighter, but I still have some questions and am open to other suggestions.\n\nBody: X-Pro2 - Pretty firm on this choice. Part practicality and part taste, I need an optical viewfinder. This is the reason I didn't jump to mirrorless cameras years ago. The EVFs are fantastic, and for most usage scenarios I have no problem using them exclusively. However, when it comes to shooting in a pitch black location in the middle of the night, it's nearly impossible to compose a shot with an EVF that is only resolving a handful of point sources from the brightest stars. I also just prefer seeing things optically, and especially with the histogram overlay in the X100S I find myself using the OVF in most cases.\n\nWide Angle: Samyang 12mm F2 or 10mm F2.8 - Here's a spot where I'm looking for some input. The wider angle of the 10 is appealing, but so is the faster optics and lighter weight of the 12. I'm currently leaning toward the 12, but I'm curious what others think. Manual focus is fine, this lens will be used mostly at night when autofocus stops being useful anyway. I was considering the Fuji 10-24 for a while, but its coma and lower speed along with higher cost made it less appealing.\n\nGeneral purpose: Fuji XF23mm f/2 - This would fill the role of my 35 f1.8, which is the lens I use the vast majority of the time anyway. I've also been eyeing the larger f1.4 version and am not opposed to saving a bit more if it's worth it, but as a lens that'll be going everywhere with me I think that the weather resistance will come in the more useful than the extra speed.\n\nTelephoto: Fuji XF55-200 or XC50-230 - Another spot where I'm having trouble deciding. For those of you who have tried them, is the aperture ring and build quality of the XF worth the drastic cost increase? This lens would get the least use of the three, but I don't want to give up on image quality if I'm already springing for an X-Pro2. Thoughts on this one? \n\n\nI'm open to suggestions on any of these. I think I've done enough research to have a good idea of what I'm getting into, but as with any big purchase I'd like to get a second opinion from those with experience before pulling the trigger.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/80cgfd/nikon_convert_looking_for_suggestions/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "fujifilm", "result": true, "Selector": "i'm looking to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "nikon convert looking for suggestions /!/ i've shot nikon for 10 years, but after buying a used x100s a while back and not shooting my d610 at all since then, i'm now looking to jump into the fuji system and begin selling my nikon gear.\n\nsome background: i primarily shoot landscapes and wide field astrophotography, with some street photography and casual portraits thrown in here and there. currently, my bag usually contains a d610, a 35 f/1.8 (this lens is on the camera about 80% of the time), a 70-300vr, and a tokina 16-28 f/2.8. it does everything i need, but after hiking a couple miles up a steep hill with that bag i'm about ready to throw it into a river. now that tax returns are coming, -----> i !!!
