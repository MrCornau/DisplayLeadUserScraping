Following up from an earlier post I made, am now deciding between these two cameras for landscapes and general photography while hiking and trekking, and also some street while travelling. Weight and portability are most important for me, and I'm moving from a Nikon DSLR (D7000) and am a big fan of prime lenses which pretty much live on my current cameras: a 50mm 1.8 on my Canon SLR and a 35mm 1.8 on my D7000.

Read some reviews that weren't too happy with the EVF. \n* XT-20: The tilting screen could be useful for hiking, but I've never had a camera with a tilt screen so it's not a huge gamechanger. \n* Ergonomics of both are similar for me.

I don't forsee myself getting into larger lenses, if my previous photography experience is anything to go by -- I'm really into going as light as possible. \n\nMy 3 options are:\n\n(1) XE-3 with 23mm f.2 -- too narrow for landscapes while hiking?

With the cashback deal, which I was on the last day of, I effectively got the 1.4x TC for \u20ac50 as it worked out. I figured I'd get it, and sell it if it wasn't up to snuff. I mostly planned to use this lens for larger wildlife [like dogs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/155307394@N06/48108226933/in/album-72157691838507272/), or [birds in zoos and parks](https://www.flickr.com/photos/155307394@N06) (note: these were taken with the Nikon), and mostly for events. I wasn't aiming for the 100-400 because I need the faster aperture for my paid gigs.\n\nI used the lens with the 1.4x TC immediately after buying it, and have some thoughts to share:\n\n- It's god damn heavy. It's only 130 g, but it's so dense that it feels massive in the hand. \n\n- It's extremely tightly built. I never had an issues with it in that regard. Got caught in a massive rainstorm and the lens, TC, and camera were fine.\n\n- Finally, the reason I'm making this post: **It's not a good companion to the 50-140 except in the most extreme cases, at least for my use case**.\n\nI figured this *might* be the case, but again, it basically cost me \u20ac50, and I can sell it easily and make a bit. I wasn't happy with many of the shots from that first day, and decided to do a semi-scientific test.\n\n**Aim:**\n\n- To test whether the inevitable sharpness degradation of the 1.4x TC was more severe than the loss of resolution caused by cropping a shot taken without the TC to yield a similar field of view. \n\n- If the sharpness degradation is low, to investigate whether the sharpness loss is worth losing a stop of light.\n\n- To compare the background rendition between the effective 140 m f/2.8 and 196 mm f/4 lenses.\n\n**Setup/methods:**\n\n- Fuji X-H1 on tripod, 2s self timer\n\n- ISO 200, wide open (f/2.8, f/4), manual shutter speed\n\n- 140 mm lens focal length only, as I only use the TC when I need range.\n\n- Subject: Hair gel on my desk. \n\n- Two sets of shots: 1 m focus distance, and a bit less than 2 m focus distance (ish). Just wanted to eyeball how much of a difference focus distance made, but I didn't want to check 10 m or 20 m as most of my wildlife shots are within a 5 m range. It's more \"animal portraiture\" than classical wildlife photography, but I digress.\n\n- Imported as-is into LR\n\n- Non-TC shots duplicated, and the latter copies were cropped visually to match as closely as possible. **This yields an approximately 12-13 MP image depending on the precision of your crop**: One was 12.0 MP, the other 12.9 MP.\n\n**Results:**\n\n- [Full album here](https://imgur.com/a/2bvvQjU)\n\n- [Two original shots at ~1.8-2 m focus distance, with TC shot on the right](https://i.imgur.com/WJqZSRB.png)\n\n- [The non-TC shot is now cropped to more or less match the TC shot](https://i.imgur.com/tvtxxHr.png)\n\n- [At 100%, the TC shot is noticeably, and in my opinion, significantly softer than the non-TC shot that was cropped](https://i.imgur.com/71F9jA4.jpg). Bear in mind that the left is a 100% view at 12.0 MP, and the latter at 24 MP. I presume the difference in magnification here is the result of the 100% view amplifying slight differences in FoV caused by my imprecise cropping.\n\n- [Shots taken at 1 m, with the non-TC already cropped in](https://i.imgur.com/ytnQfon.png)\n\n- [Again, the TC shot at 24 MP is significantly softer than the 12.9 MP (in this case) shot](https://i.imgur.com/Av6rzPn.jpg).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The sharpness degradation at 100% is significant, and in my opinion, worse than simply cropping in. \n\n- The background rendition is different between the two, but negligible in my eyes except within a direct side-by-side comparison. The extra focal length does not significantly outweigh the slower aperture.\n\n- This test is limited by the range of focus distances tested. It is my opinion that in very extreme cases where the subject is *very* far away, the increase in resolution from (say) 2.5 MP to ~5 MP may overcome the softness when using the TC.\n\n- This test is limited by the fact that the lens was only tested wide open in both cases. My use case is: wide open; get close. For landscapes, I rarely shoot above 135 mm equivalent, so I would never use the TC in that scenario and am not interested in testing it. For events, lack of light means I'm often at ISO 3200 and f/2.8 anyway.\n\n- This test is also limited by the low ISO used. Noise at high ISO may decrease the difference in apparent resolution.\n\n**Further work:**\n\n- Set up a shot with fine detail (possibly my garden shed), repeat this test, and see if the difference is noticeable in print form. I'll do this just for the sake of it. The actual sharpness difference is too high IMO, and I never print larger than 12x8\", and the loss of light is significant for my purposes.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/cj998v/my_experience_with_the_14x_tc_and_50140_mm_f28_a/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "fujifilm", "result": true, "Selector": "i'm making", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "my experience with the 1.4x tc and 50-140 mm f/2.8 - a test /!/ hi all!\n\nwith the money earned by selling my nikon 70-200, the recent cashback deal, a gift card i got for my birthday, and my lcs confirming that the cashback deal applied to the 50-140 **and** 1.4 tc kit (~\u20ac300 savings vs. buying separately), i decided to buy said kit. with the cashback deal, which i was on the last day of, i effectively got the 1.4x tc for \u20ac50 as it worked out. i figured i'd get it, and sell it if it wasn't up to snuff. i mostly planned to use this lens for larger wildlife [like dogs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/155307394@n06/48108226933/in/album-72157691838507272/), or [birds in zoos and parks](https://www.flickr.com/photos/155307394@n06) (note: these were taken with the nikon), and mostly for events. i wasn't aiming for the 100-400 because i need the faster aperture for my paid gigs.\n\ni used the lens with the 1.4x tc immediately after buying it, and have some thoughts to share:\n\n- it's god damn heavy. it's only 130 g, but it's so dense that it feels massive in the hand. \n\n- it's extremely tightly built. i never had an issues with it in that regard. got caught in a massive rainstorm and the lens, tc, and camera were fine.\n\n- finally, the reason -----> i !!!

The XF16-55mm &amp; XF16-80mm. \n\nI currently shoot with 2 prime lenses; 35mm &amp; 50mm.  I have managed to make due with these two lenses for quite sometime on my X-T20 &amp; X-H1. However, I have been running into a wall regarding my next lens. I have been a prime shooter for sometime, and was thinking of getting a few more prime lenses over time that would be as low as 16mm, and fill in the gaps as needed for other focal lengths. However, I have come to my senses, and began giving the Fuji zoom lenses consideration. The thought of not having to swap lenses as frequently, and travel with less. Would be very nice. \n\nAfter doing some research, I find the XF16-55mm very appealing. It has a low aperture for a zoom lens, professional grade class lens, sharp focus, and is highly revered amongst photographers. The lens doesn\u2019t have IOS, but I have a camera body with IBIS (X-H1). \n\nI have also had recommendations to look into the XF16-80mm as well.

I've been looking at Fujifilm for a while now, and I've recently found an outstanding deal, specifically on the Fujifilm X-T20 with the 16-55mm for USD 450. I'm making this to ask if switching to the X-T20 will be more beneficial to me. I've always wanted to go mirrorless, as they tend to be way smaller than DSLRs and are easier to travel with, and I find Fuji's EVFs as a massive plus over a traditional viewfinder.

Though I've been stalking the Fujifilm subreddit for quite some time. Looks like a great community and I thought maybe someone here has went through something similar that I'm going through as of right now. \n\nA couple years ago I switched from Nikon to Fujifilm, mainly because of the weight reduction and to make photography more fun by bringing the camera with me more often (which hasn't been true). I also wanted better video capabilities for my YouTube channel. \n\nSo I had the Nikon D610, 20 1.8G, 50 1.8G and the 70-200 f/4 VR all which I absolutely loved and just made sense to me. I had fun with it but at the time I decided to make the switch I was getting kind of bored with it. I don't know why. I just wasn't \"seeing\" things anymore.\n\nI made a change of camera equipment for the reasons stated above in hopes that maybe it spark my interest and it did spark my interest again. I had a blast throughout 2018 shooting with my new Fuji system.  But yet here we are at nearly the end of 2019 (this year gone by TOO fast) and I'm feeling the same way I did when I had my Nikon system. Like I'm just not having fun anymore.\n\nI've bought and sold many, many Fujifilm lenses. I've owned the 35 f/2, same with the 23 f/2. I've sold the 18-55 and then bought it again and thinking about selling it again. I've bought the 10-24 and then sold it (although it was because of money issues), I've also bought the 35 1.4, didn't like it much and got rid of it a couple months later. I bought the 60 2.4 macro when I first got my XT2 kit and still have it now. A lot of my best photos were taken with that lens but I'm kind of bored of it now and hate the mechanics of it. The lens has pissed me off more than once. I even bought a cheap Meike manual focus lens but found it meh. Just recently I bought the Rokinon 12mm f/2 and I hate it. I can't stand the sunstars it creates, horrible and distracting. Although, the lens is amazing for astrophotography which I rarely do. I also miss having the 10-24 for that crazy UWA distortion at 10mm, its something I haven't experienced before. \n\nSo currently in my bag I have a XT2, 18-55, 23 f/2, 60 2.4 and the Rokinon 12mm f/2. Sounds like a well rounded kit, right? It is honestly. It shouldn't hinder my creativity at all, but every single time I feel like I want to go out and shoot, I never know what lens to use and I ended up getting stressed over the decision or wish I had brought something else or wish I had this bought this lens instead or whatever.\n\nI just feel like my passion and interest in photography is slipping away. I want to have fun with creating photographs again. It's always been a way of therapy for me as I deal with depression. Lately its been making me further depressed. Once in a while I'll have a good day or two when I actually enjoy shooting but those days are getting far and far less.\n\nI've thought about just selling it all and picking up a X100F and just rolling with that for a while and shoot the heck out of it and maybe I'll find my way again. I also thought about just taking a break from photography and focusing on other projects in the meantime and maybe it will come back to me when the time is right or maybe it just won't. Yet others also said to just keep pushing through.\n\nThe issue is being a generalist, I don't have one particular subject I enjoy shooting. I like shooting anything that sparks my interest and lately it hasn't been much.\n\nI know for a lot of photographers who switched to Fujifilm really made them have fun with photography again and that was my intent when I switched but it only worked for a year. I don't if it's just time for another change or I'm stressing out over the gear that I have and neglect sometimes? Lately I seem to be only using the 23 f/2. \n\nI'm hoping others have been through something similar and could give me advice on what you did that helped.

Whenever I'm in a EVF/LCD mode that should split between them, the eye sensor initially realises I don't have my face up top it.

Sorry is this is alot or these seem basic, im just struggling a bit with the amount of things I feel like I dont know.  Feel free to answer as many as you can/would like to.\n\n*So far I've been shooting jpegs just because I wanted to experiment a bit without diving into RAW.  I have Capture One for editing, (more so when I start messing around with raw) are there meaningful edits I can make with Jpegs? I've been messing around with a few a bit and i'm struggling with what exactly to do.  Are there certain adjustments that should be made everytime that are pretty standard? Are there certain edits that should be made taking into account what type of camera and lens combo you are using/focal length?  Or is it really by individual photo?  Is there a good guide for making adjustments to photos that someone can point me to?  Not just a how to, but also why.  Like how to adjust something, but also how to recognize what needs to be adjusted in a photo, and why that adjustment produces a better image.\n\n*I would like to start shooting Jpeg+RAW so I can start messing around with RAW.  My understanding of RAW is that it saves more image data so that you have more info with which to work with/edit later?  How much time editing does this require?  Is there a workflow or common set of setting that you can apply to all your RAW photos when you download them from your camera? Is RAW that much better than Jpeg?  Or does it depend on the image/how you are shooting?\n\n*Is anyone aware of just a general XT-20 guide (bonus for info about using XF18-55mm) beyond just the standard Fuji manual?\n\nCamera Gear and such\n*Camera came with a micro sd card in a standard sd adapter.  Is there any reason to use a micro?  I would like to pick up a second SD card, at lest 64gb but preferably 128gb.  What is a good card?  I was looking at the san disk extreme pro SDXC.\n\n*Is there any sort of regular maintenance I need to do with the camera?  Is there any reason that I should ever clean the sensor?  Any particular way I should be cleaning the lenses?\n\n*Is there any other \"must have\" gear that you would recommend?  I already have a small camera bag and L plate grip.  I'm interested in getting a adjustable camera strap that I can switch from wearing high up on my chest to around my hip, seems like the peak straps are pretty popular.  I'm also interested in a small packable tripod, just something I can use to set up for time lapse and such, any recommendations?   Any thoughts on value of thumb grips, shutter buttons?\n\nThanks for the help everyone!
