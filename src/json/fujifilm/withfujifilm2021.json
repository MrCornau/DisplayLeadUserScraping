I came up with the decision to get a compact camera as grab&amp;go option when I'm going to places where I'm not sure I will have the chance to shoot or not, or for the occasions in which I wouldn't bring my heavier FF camera for a variety of reasons. I'm talking about trekkings, museums, walks around the city, boat trips... You name one. I don't have any specific use in mind, on the contrary I just want something that does not make me regret of leaving the camera at home (which happened a lot in the past years because FF is bulkier/heavier/I need a specific bag/etc). I don't like using the smartphone for taking photos, and I care about photo quality.\n\nI would probably use it for street photos, but also landscapes, portraits. I'm not scared by the fixed lens because many times I just use the Sony 35mm f/1.8 on the FF, and I used APS-C before, so I'm aware of the differences in terms of low-light performances&amp;co. I don't need something that fits a jeans pocket (I usually have a little backpack with me - or girlfriend's purse).

Fortunately it dropped onto carpet, but unfortunately it hit the edge of my desk on its way down. There were no external signs of damage and some quick testing at the time didn\u2019t indicate anything was wrong with it, however I didn\u2019t do any extensive tests since I\u2019d gotten an X100V and wasn\u2019t using my X-T1/lenses much at the time. Fast forward to this weekend, I\u2019ve just replaced my X100V with an X-Pro3 and while playing around with the 35mm I started getting a \u201cTurn off camera and turn on again\u201d error while manual focusing. This only seems to happen while manual focusing and when the front element is extended at its furthest, and not during any AF functions but I did notice it hunts a bit more in AF mode than I remembered (though again it\u2019s been a while since I used it regularly). I\u2019ve tested the camera with other lenses as well and the error only comes up with the 35mm.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to ship it to Fuji\u2019s repair center in NJ for inspection and repair and was wondering what people\u2019s experiences have been when sending in damaged lenses. More specifically, what is the average turn-around time and is there any chance I\u2019ll have this back before my trip in a month? Also, there\u2019s an option to have them send you a replacement unit rather than repairing it.
