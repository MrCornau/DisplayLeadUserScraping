Normal Behaviour? /!/ Quick question. I just recently bought a Fujifilm X-T3 camera today and I just noticed how much auto white balancing this thing does. I am in a room with dim light (it's dark outside currently), so I don't have great light, but when I unboxed my camera and look through the EVF or LCD screen, I see that my auto-balancing makes constant changes in the color. So when I turn to left in a certain spot in my room it always turns to orange (as if im using the fluorescent WB filter), when I move to the right (to the white wall) the WB is much better again. When I move to the third spot in the room everything becomes a little bit - only a little bit - more magenta. Is there something I'm missing here? Because I didn't remember my X-T20 making such huge changes to my white balance; it was much more subtle then. The auto WB changes on my X-T3 look a bit overkill to me. It really feels like I am using some 'spot metering' equivalent but then for the white balance instead of the exposure.\nSo I was thinking. Is this normal behaviour? I updated my firmware to 3.0.0 and it's still the same, but when I hardcode my whitebalance or when I lock my white balance the colors do not change at all. It's when I'm releasing the shutter and set my white balance to auto, the huge 'color tone shift' fires off again.
