I currently own a Canon 5D (original model) and a bunch of EF primes (20mm, 28mm, 50mm, and 100mm).

Here are a couple of thoughts about it:\n\n* I tend to prefer working with primes, as I really enjoy fast apertures. 35mm to 50mm  (in full-frame) is my sweet spot\n* I prefer mechanical controls and dials whenever possible, so cameras like the X100, X-T, X-Pro, etc. are quite attractive in that regard\n* I do end up cropping most of my photos in a ratio of 1:1 or 5:4, so any camera that would be able to show me crop lines for these proportions in the viewfinder would be an excellent plus (not sure if this is a feature as I never played around with these Fujifilm cameras)\n* I don't need the latest and shiniest camera; I am also hoping to be able to sell my lenses and camera and not have to put up more money on it\n* I tend to shoot raw but I am quite conservative with how much I edit my photos.

Contrast and color are just a tad bit better on the 35. I don't personally notice any significant differences in vignetting or distortion between the two. Color fringing appears a bit more of a concern on the 35. Sharpness at f/2 at the minimum focusing distance is poor on the 35. The 27, while not able to focus as closely and limited to f/2.8, is extremely sharp at the minimum.\n\n\n**Ease of Use**\nThe 27 does of course feel practically non-existent when mounted. There's basically no grip for the left hand, similar to the X100 series, so you'll be dependent on the right hand for stability. Makes modifying the shutter dial a bit of a pain. The 35 is wonderful to use. The weight difference between the two is pretty insignificant in use. The 27 focuses loudly and much slower than the 35.
