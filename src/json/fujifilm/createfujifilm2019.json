I decided on creating a prime only kit for the X-Pro2, as the point is mostly to cut down on weight and size while maximizing image quality, that's why I won't be thinking of the XF 10-24mm f/4. Here are my choices:\n\n* **Fujifilm XF 14mm f/2.8 R:** This seems like the optically better lens out of the bunch, but I'm not sure if I will be happy with the narrower field of view of the equivalent to 21mm focal length, but I also assume it will be easier to stitch panoramas with it.\n* **Zeiss Touit 12mm f/2.8:** This lens seems great as far as specs go, it seems to not be as sharp as the other two, but still pretty good. It's got a field of view that I like better than the 14mm. After searching for images made with this lens, I don't find all that many and am not particularly impressed with them, but maybe that's due to a lower adoption rate because of it's higher price tag to the other two.\n* **Samyang 12mm f/2 NCS CS:** Apparently this is sharper than the Zeiss, with the same field of view, and also much cheaper. Things I dislike about it are the fact that there's no communication to the camera (so no EXIF data), no autofocus (given the focal length, this is probably not an issue anyways), but I'm much more worried about lateral chromatic aberration, which is according to lens tip the higher of the three and also the 5 apperture blades in this lens produced rather bad looking sun stars which I'm not a fan of. On the other hand, the images I've seen created with this lens look great.\n\nI'm particularly interested in the Zeiss lens, but am rather skeptical due to the fact that I'm not all that impressed by the images I've seen created with this lens.
