I have been shooting in 4k 25FPS at 100mbps and I am absolutely loving Eterna and its post production potential.\u00a0\n\nI never missed the 4k 60FPS to be fair. However, recently I got a project where I had to have some slow motion shots overlapping with normal-speed shots so I have now to record at a higher frame rate, and the way I usually do it is recording in 50FPS. First thing I did obviously was to revert back to 1080p and shoot there with 50FPS at 100mbps, and then I had some issues while uploading the footage to YouTube in 1080p. The quality dropped significantly so I had to upscale the footage to 1440p in order to preserve the quality, but I could tell that the image is defintely obviously upscaled and doesnt have that certain crisp to it like the 4k does, and this is when I started missing the 4k 50FPS.\n\nI made some tests and I started noticing some odd things. First thing is, the frame rate does not affect the size of the video file neither in 4k nor in 1080p, unlike the Canon cameras. With Canons, the higher the frame rate, the bigger the file size becomes and the faster the camera overheats. Go ahead try it yourself and you will see that the file size stays almost the same on the Fujis.\n\nSecondly, the video resolution does not also affect the video size at all. 4k at 100mbps has the same video size as 1080p at 100mbps. The only thing that changes the video size is the 200mbps feature. Other than that it stays the same which leads me to asking:\u00a0\n\nWhy cant we have the option of recording in 4k 60FPS on the X-T30? I really wish that this can be fixed because I really think it is a very unnecessary limitation. I can live with the 10 minutes recording limit, that is absolutely fine as to not go crazy with the camera, but the 4k 60FPS being left out like that is just odd in my opinion because the camera is very much capable of recording in 4k 60FPS... or is it?\u00a0\n\nFrom what I am seeing, since the frame rates and the resolution do not affect the file size it means that the camera is putting the same amount of efforts into recording them? It is just a small haunch. Correct me if I am mistaken please!\u00a0\n\nAnd the other annoying thing is that slow motion playback of high frame rate videos... I mean why. Why cant we just review the video normally without the extremely slow playback?

I feel like it's important to know for prospective buyers that even cameras purchased in June of 2020 could still potentially face this issue.\n\nI'm not trying to disparage Fujifilm at all (I would consider myself a pretty vocal supporter of Fujifilm amongst my friends/colleagues when recommending cameras). Rather, the point of this is to hopefully add some visibility into this issue, and confirm that it is still happening more than 6 months after product launch, because I am not seeing that messaging in the documentation, dealers, blogs/videos online, nor Fuji themselves. And $2700 CAD is alotta dough.\n\nThanks\n\n**Important PSA for new users**: The **very first thing** you need to do before even playing with the settings of your camera, is to update the firmware. You should literally not do anything else with it first. Fuji has since released a firmware update for the camera that PREVENTS this issue, but if the issue is already occurring, it *cannot fix* the issue. I just want to throw that out there because this isn't documented very much online, and there are certainly no warning labels on or in the box, and my Fuji dealer did not mention this at all. It needs way more visibility.\n\nI drove 2 hours to pick up my camera. I finally found a store in my approximate region that has one in stock. I've been dreaming of an X-Pro camera for a couple of years and after watching countless videos about the camera, decided the X-Pro3 is what I want.\n\nI got the camera, started playing around with the settings and setup in my car. Everything looked good! Finally got everything set up, then went to explore the city and try it out.\n\nI was having a good time getting used to how it worked, working out which knob/button did what, and had a good time shooting. At some point, probably about an hour after I first started shooting, I noticed that I could no longer activate the hybrid viewfinder mode. When I was setting the camera up before, it worked -- I saw the focus points in the bottom right. However, no matter which way I pushed the viewfinder selector, it wasn't switching anymore. This was kind of nagging at me, but I hoped there was something I was missing and would do more research when I got home and was able to use my computer to dig around.\n\nAbout an hour after that, I grabbed some lunch, and wanted to get a shot from inside the restaurant to outside. When I put the camera up to my eyes, the EVF was completely washed out with a bright gray/white. I could barely make out the subject in front of me. Prior to this, I noticed the low battery warning so I figured this washed out look was probably (hopefully) the result of the camera not having enough power. For the record, the OVF was also experiencing the same issue. Even though it's an optical viewfinder, there was a large square in the middle (inside of where you would normally see the electronic frame lines) that was completely washed out.\n\nWhen I got back to my car, I changed the battery with a new one. It didn't resolve the issue. I tried a second new battery, same issue. One of these new batteries was fully charged. After messing around with the Fuji mobile app, I realized I could update the camera's firmware via my phone connection to my camera. I downloaded the 46MB update on my phone, then connected to my camera via Wifi and the camera updated. Upon restarting, the issue was still persisting.\n\nIt was at that point that I looked online and found a small number of forum posts regarding this same issue. Fuji has stated this only affects a 'few' units but I'm not really too sure how realistic that is given the number of posts I've seen. The X-Pro3 is already a pretty niche camera, so even having 1000 affected units would translate to a pretty high percentage of total units. I also learned that Fuji has confirmed that the firmware update is confirmed to prevent this issue from happening, but it CANNOT fix a camera that is already experiencing the issue. It's shocking that given this important information, there is zero notice of how crucial this firmware update is immediately upon receiving the camera.\n\nI've been really happy with Fujifilm after switching from Canon a couple of years ago. I've liked their branding and philosophy -- their response to this strikes me as a bit odd and is definitely disappointing. I admire their design philosophy and overall craftsmanship that goes into their cameras and optics, and will continue as a fan. But I truthfully am finding it a bit harder to blindly trust that their products are going to be built with the utmost quality. Many products have defects, especially in the first run, but the reluctance to admit the full reach of it is a little concerning.\n\nFuji has asked for me to send it in to them, provide a copy of my receipt IF I want it covered under warranty (it was purchased yesterday..), and there'll be a wait time for the technician to determine if the issue can be repaired, or if a replacement needs to be sent out. The wait time is understandable with the current situation, for sure. \n\nI've decided to take an early drive tomorrow back to the dealer. They've set aside another camera, and I'm going to swap it -- this is my dream camera, so I'm going to try again. I'm going to update the firmware as soon as I get it.

finally got everything set up, then went to explore the city and try it out.\n\ni was having a good time getting used to how it worked, working out which knob/button did what, and had a good time shooting. at some point, probably about an hour after i first started shooting, i noticed that i could no longer activate the hybrid viewfinder mode. when i was setting the camera up before, it worked -- i saw the focus points in the bottom right. however, no matter which way i pushed the viewfinder selector, it wasn't switching anymore. this was kind of nagging at me, but i hoped there was something i was missing and would do more research when i got home and was able to use my computer to dig around.\n\nabout an hour after that, i grabbed some lunch, and wanted to get a shot from inside the restaurant to outside. when i put the camera up to my eyes, the evf was completely washed out with a bright gray/white. -----> i !!!

This was my first camera upgrade since 2013, and I bought a beautiful used X-T3 after many weeks of research trying to determine the best camera for me to buy. I was totally sold on the X-T3. It had the dials I wanted, a highly praised EVF, weather sealing, dual card slots, and my must-have feature, the tilting screen because I love shooting from the hip. The looks were just the cherry on top.\n\nI love this camera, but after shooting with it for a while, I realized I always had my 18-55 set on either 23mm or 55mm 99% of the time. I mainly shoot street and travel, and occasionally enjoy shooting portraits with my girlfriend and family. I figured the best move for me would be to buy the 23mm f2, and the 50mm f2, and I was content with picking those up over the next few months or so. I have not bought either yet, and continue to only use my 18-55.\n\nThe more I shoot with this camera, the bigger and heavier it seems. Don't get me wrong, I really love it, and its way smaller and lighter than my Canon DSLR, and feels fantastic in hand. However I NEVER use the EVF because it's still so strange to me looking at a screen compared to the OVF I am used to. I have no interest in the 27mm, and planned to rarely use the 18-55 after buying the 23mm and 50mm f2. As time goes on, I find myself going places that couldn't justify bringing a backpack or camera bag, and wishing my form factor would just fit in a coat pocket or fanny pack. I get to these places, without my camera, and see beautiful moments I wish I could have captured, but couldn't because I didn't want to be that guy bringing a full system to the grocery store, or that guy getting his camera stolen from his car because he left it in there when going into the grocery store. You get the idea.\n\nNow I'm realizing, that if I don't use the EVF, I only really want 2 affordable primes, and am not doing any paid work, I may have over-compensated for my needs in an attempt to future proof myself as much as possible. Would my needs be better fulfilled by a X100V and using the TCL on occasion?\n\nI know this seems like I've just kind of typed out the fact that I already know what I want, and that I should make the switch, but I also know how fantastic and feature packed the X-T3 is, and that me having it with me or not is my responsibility, and form factor is kind of a lame excuse for missing shots, especially when the camera isn't really that big. I just can't shake the feeling that even though I should be content with this camera body, it's just more than I need. Yet, on the other hand I feel like if I make the switch, I may miss the opportunities to use the tighter focal lengths when I want to take portraits. It's very possible I am just getting too obsessed with form factor, and I need to just shut up and take photos, but the temptation to be able to take the X100V with me literally anywhere, anytime, is killing me. I am generally a very conscious shopper, and almost never regret my purchases, but I'm so on the fence about this and don't really have any photography pals to talk me into or out of it.

I shoot landscapes, architecture and street photography. I've had entry level DSLR's, I've had Nikon FF cameras and plenty of great lenses. I gave all of that up because it was just too heavy and I bought the x100s.I loved it, everything about it was fantastic, but after 2 years of shooting I really started to miss the telephoto perspective even though I had the TCL converter. I sold it and got the XT-20 with the 18-55 kit lens. Something just didn't click for me, I never liked the images that came out the same as I did with the x100s. I even got the 27mm pancake to try and get a similar feel, it didn't work. The last attempt was getting the 55-200mm for a trip in California and that lens provided a different perspective but at that point my bag was insanely heavy and I didn't want to take it anywhere, so I sold everything again. 6 months later I find myself looking for another camera to try and spark my love for photography again... And here comes the dilemma. I know what the X100v will give me and I'm sure that I will love it, but the price is a bit steep. Looking at the second hand market, I can get the XT-3 with a lens for that money or an X-Pro2.

My fuji raws are blurry and distorted after processing /!/ Hi all, complete and total beginner with capture one (and off-camera post processing in general). I wanted to start using it for a few reasons, including organizing my shots, previewing film sims and edits on a larger screen, and learning to actually edit my raws. \n\nI'm shooting with a fuji xt30, and I'm not having any luck with getting the capture one jpgs to look anywhere near as good as the jpgs processed in-body on the camera.\nI was worried that capture one's reproductions of the film sims would be off, but they actually look 100% accurate, which is hype. But when I finally exported my first jpg it looked off. When I compared it to the one processed by the camera body, it's pretty dramatic. Not as bad as silkypix (at least there's no chromatic aberration), but still blurry and distorted.\n\nI haven't made any changes to settings, as I wouldn't know what to change... I also just assumed that the fujifilm specific version of the software would handle fuji raws optimally out of the box, in terms of sharpness and accuracy, at least. I'm processing raws and the software is picking up the correct lens and loading the correct lens profile. \"Diffraction correction\" wasn't checked by default, so I tried checking that, but no difference.\n\nHere's a pair of sample jpegs, one processed in the camera and the other in capture one, with no edits to either and the same film sim (yes, you have to zoom in a little to tell, it's not very noticable as a mobile thumbnail. It is very noticable full size or just full screen though =/): https://imgur.com/a/ugjNKZ0\n\nI read somewhere to try disabling hardware acceleration for processing, so I tried that, and it did indeed take longer, but no difference in the final image.\n\nFor some reason the default output resolution is 300 px/inch, so I tried changing that to 72 px/inch to match the camera jpgs, but didn't make any difference (what should it be set to, if not for print or web but just maximum jpeg quality?). The capture one output is slightly lower resolution, and I don't know what's up with that either? They clock in at 5959 x 3973, whereas the camera jpgs are 6240 x 4160.
