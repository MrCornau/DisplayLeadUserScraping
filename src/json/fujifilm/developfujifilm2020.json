I\u2019m a new Fuji boy; just got my X-T1 about a month ago. I\u2019ve been shooting with the 35 f/2, but it\u2019s time to broaden my horizons...and focal length. \n\nI\u2019m looking to go a bit wider, so I am looking toward my next lens purchase. I\u2019m considering either the 23mm f/1.4 or the f/2. Also considering the 18-55mm since it\u2019s so cheap and zoom lenses are so practical. \n\nMy long-term goal is to completely switch from Nikon to Fuji. I use Nikon for work right now and Fuji for fun, but once I\u2019ve developed a sufficient Fuji kit, I\u2019ll buy a newer body and migrate over completely. With that in mind, I\u2019d like my next lens purchase to be a permanent member of my future kit. \n\nWeather sealing isn\u2019t super important to me. Autofocus speed isn\u2019t super important to me. The 16mm 1.4 is a bit too wide for me right now. \n\nLet me know which of the three lenses you prefer! If you have any alternative suggestions, I\u2019d be glad to hear them.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/f2lc10/next_lens_purchase_seeking_advice_from_the_old/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "fujifilm", "result": true, "Selector": "i\u2019ve developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "next lens purchase? seeking advice from the old heads. /!/ hey folks. i\u2019m a new fuji boy; just got my x-t1 about a month ago. i\u2019ve been shooting with the 35 f/2, but it\u2019s time to broaden my horizons...and focal length. \n\ni\u2019m looking to go a bit wider, so i am looking toward my next lens purchase. i\u2019m considering either the 23mm f/1.4 or the f/2. also considering the 18-55mm since it\u2019s so cheap and zoom lenses are so practical. \n\nmy long-term goal is to completely switch from nikon to fuji. -----> i !!!  use nikon for work right now and fuji for fun, but once -----> i !!! \u2019ve -----> developed !!!  a sufficient fuji kit, -----> i !!! \u2019ll buy a newer body and migrate over completely. with that in mind, i\u2019d like my next lens purchase to be a permanent member of my future kit. \n\nweather sealing isn\u2019t super important to me. autofocus speed isn\u2019t super important to me. the 16mm 1.4 is a bit too wide for me right now. \n\nlet me know which of the three lenses you prefer! if you have any alternative suggestions, i\u2019d be glad to hear them.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 61306, "year": "2020"}], "name": "developfujifilm2020"}
