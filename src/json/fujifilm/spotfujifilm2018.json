I have two X-T2s and I had a X-T1 previously. The X-H1 is incredible. It takes everything I love about the X-T2 and makes it better in so many ways.\n\n**Size and Weight**\n\nFirstly, it is noticeably larger and heavier. The grip is much more substantial. Of course an increase in weight and size isn't really a positive, but I don't mind it. I came to Fuji from a Canon 5D MKIII, so the X-H1 is still small to me. This camera feels much better in the hand than the X-T2, and I love the X-T2!\n\n\n**Sub Monitor**\n\nBye-bye exposure compensation dial that I never used, and hello awesome sub monitor! I love having access to that information when looking down at the camera, and of course being able to see battery level and shots remaining while it's off is awesome. I know there are exposure comp fans out there, but don't fret - that feature is still available via a button beside the shutter button!\n\n\n**AF-ON**\n\nThe newly renamed AF-ON button feels great and it's in the perfect spot. I now have back button focus enabled and it's more comfortable than on the X-T2.\n\n\n**Strap**\n\nFinally a decent strap. It's very comfortable and much larger and more padded than the X-T1/X-T2. I'll still probably throw a Peak Design Slide Lite and anchors on it, but this will do for now for sure.\n\n\n**Touch Screen**\n\nNot a feature I thought I would use much, but I was wrong. Swiping through shots is nice, and so is pinching to zoom in. I love the quick swipes in the four directions to get to different functions, like swiping down to turn the level on. Touching to focus is awesome for video and tripod use!\n\n\n**IBIS**\n\nThe main reason I wanted the X-H1 is the IBIS and it's a dream. My 23/35/50/90 are now stabilized and it's incredible. My keeper rate on the 90mm when handheld wasn't that great when I was below 1/160s. This will boost my keeper rate through the roof. And of course it's absolutely amazing for video!\n\n\n**Video**\n\nSpeaking of video, I am so excited for these changes. They've DOUBLED the bit rate to 200Mbps. They've added the ability to record F-log to the card. They added 17:9. Eterna is gorgeous. Etc. Etc.\n\n**Grip**\n\nIf you buy the X-H1, buy the grip. IT COMES WITH TWO BATTERIES. At least in Canada, you get three batteries with the camera+grip kit. The batteries are expensive on their own, so the grip is totally worth it. It boosts performance, adds more video recording time, and gives you a headphone jack. I had the grip for my X-T1 and I have one for my X-T2. This one feels even more solid. No-brainer for me.\n\n\n**Closing**\n\nI still love the size and weight of the X-T2 and I will still use it, especially when I want to rock one of my small primes and keep it light. But the X-H1 is a dream. I really believe Fuji has listened to their users and has created an incredible camera.\n\nNow, it's a tiny bit buggy, so I'm hoping a firmware update is coming soon.
