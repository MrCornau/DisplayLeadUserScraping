I'll try to explain why and I will include a couple of comparisons AND the RAF files. Can we have a real discussion about this? /!/ First, I need to make it clear that the X-Trans sensor does not absolutely ruin any shots. And in some instances, its problems are not very visible at all. Its mostly when shooting landscapes that it starts to become annoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, **I am not here to make anyone feel bad for their choices in cameras!** This is mostly me venting a little bit. And I personally LOVE my X-T2, I just dont love the sensor it has.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, all of this is based on mostly landscape photography and on selling prints. Selling prints means I pixel peep to make sure things are sharp and in focus and to fix dead/hot pixels. I think that is valid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** I should also mention that yes, the way Lightroom handles X-Trans files is terrible. And if they could get their shit together I would be really happy. Maybe if they did that, some aspect of the X-Trans sensor would make it stand out. Or maybe it would just bring it up to the same quality as a normal sensor. But I would be happy if Adobe fixed LR, just to be clear!\n\n**EDIT2:** The more I think about it, the more I blame Lightroom. I might post these comparisons over on the Lightroom subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are the two big problems with the X-Trans sensor, in my opinion:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. There are swirly artifacts that look ugly and needs to be fixed in small details in the image. Like, if a tiny object has a different color to its surroundings, it looks desaturated and does not keep its color as well as it should.\n2. Colors look washed out. Meaning, there is less \u201ccolor definition\u201d in small details in the image. Like, if a tiny object has a different color to its surroundings, it looks desaturated and does not keep its color as well as it should.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither I can fix these issues by using the Enhance Detail feature in LR. The problem with that is that it requires more clicks, more time, and more disk space. And If I want to delete those files afterwards, to save up disk space, it requires even more clicking and time. With thousands of photos over several years, that adds up, and it does not feel like a good solution to me.\n\nOr I can fix them by using a different program to edit my RAF files in. But that is something that is very hard for me to do because I make a lot of panoramas. And I have yet to find any other RAW editor that lets me stitch RAW files and that outputs a panorama with all the dynamic range of the RAW files I stitched. For me, that is a killer feature.\n\nMaybe there are other ways of fixing these issues that I cant remember. But here is the thing, if the files from this sensor needs fixing, is this sensor even worth using? I\u2019m genuinely curious! What is it about this sensor that makes it worth it?\n\nThe X-Trans sensor has very few GOOD aspects that a normal sensor doesn\u2019t also have. Except 2 small things when compared to the X-T100 sensor. (Small for me at least). In the dark, high ISO shots look a less noisy (but even then the normal sensor shows fine detail and color definition better).  And X-Trans has less moir\u00e9 patterns. But that is very rarely an issue for me.\n\nMaybe I have overlooked something, but right now I can\u2019t think of any aspects of the X-Trans sensor that makes it worth it. At least not for me.\n\n**Here are the comparisons:**\n\nThese were shot with an X-T2 and an X-T100. I used a Laowa 65mm lens. Its fully manual, so that is why it says that the aperture is f1, but I shot all of these at f8. I used that lens because its very sharp and it has practically no chromatic aberrations.\n\nAlso, these are not very nice photos. I shot them only to highlight how the X-Trans sensor behaves. I did not want to take really nice shots and share those. Hope you understand.\n\n\\[The first comparison is a landscape. Look at how the X-Trans sensor looses the color in the grass and how the ground looks \u201cwrong\u201d. It\u2019s a little hard to describe, but it does not look good. The trees dont look right either IMO\\]([https://i.imgur.com/5Jku4oH.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/5Jku4oH.jpeg))\n\nHere are the RAF files:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaouEUmnoIOwshGcO9ZXgb8aTrHeP\\_7y/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaouEUmnoIOwshGcO9ZXgb8aTrHeP_7y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zye5uuCE3vfLnIgOumCTyoN-DBgz8l\\_D/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zye5uuCE3vfLnIgOumCTyoN-DBgz8l_D/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\\[Here is the other one.

I\u2019ve had this opinion (that X-Trans is worse than normal sensors) long before I shot these.

So I have seen the effects of the X-Trans sensor for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m not posting any of the other photos where X-Trans made them look bad only because I dont have a direct comparison with the X-T100 for them. **But if there is any interest in seeing single examples, I\u2019ll see what I can do.** (Can\u2019t guarantee anything ofc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nHere are some more samples. This first one is NOT a great comparison, just to be clear. Its not great because it was shot on different days from slightly different angles and the light and weather was different. Only the subject and the lens is the same.\n\n[I shot the X-T2 photo because I liked how the tree stood out from the dark background. When I got home and saw how terrible it looks, I decided I NEED to get an X-T100 to compare. So the second photo was shot several days later.

I've searched the internet for some type of lookup table for this stuff but for the one I found almost all of it was wrong for an image from an xtrans4 (new version) sensor.

Can someone test this by setting clarity to +1 and switching between S and CL modes and then report back if they see any difference in EVF smoothness (when panning, etc)? (CL mode force-disables the clarity setting, hence why it's one the easiest ways to test this).\n\nFor me, EVF with clarity at 0 is silky smooth (feels like 60 FPS?) and clarity at +1 is slightly choppy, 30-ish FPS, maybe? Boost mode doesn't seem to make any difference and neither do any other IQ options.\n\nThe lag isn't too bad and I assigned \"natural view\" to a button (natural view is consistently smooth) for quick switching, but I could've sworn there wasn't any lag before \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nQuick google search shows that I'm not the only one having this issue\n\n[https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4523071](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4523071)\n\nbut I wanted to double check to make sure.\n\nThank you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/pstrmh/xt4_low_fps_in_evf_w_clarity_setting/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "fujifilm", "result": true, "Selector": "i wanted to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "x-t4 low fps in evf w/ clarity setting /!/ hi,\n\ni'm not sure if it has always been like that or if it just started happening a few days ago but it's something that -----> i !!!  can't unsee now and it got me a bit worried so -----> i !!!  -----> wanted !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  sure that my unit isn't defective:\n\ncan x-t4 owners confirm that there is a noticeable difference in evf \"smoothness\" depending on the clarity setting? can someone test this by setting clarity to +1 and switching between s and cl modes and then report back if they see any difference in evf smoothness (when panning, etc)?
