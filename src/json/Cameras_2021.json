First post in this sub, but I've been doing photo/video for over 20 years now. I'm looking for a new 'B cam' and wanted to get some input. My 'A cam' is a Canon 80D with EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8, which is perfect for indoor photo/video (and I have a variety of other canon EF and EF-S lenses as well, all of which are lower quality). My other DSLRs are also Canons with Magic Lantern (SL1 and 50D), which I plan to sell or give away, probably with some of my older lenses. And my phone is a Pixel 4, which has a decent camera, but I only really use it for still photos of my kid, and work stuff.\n\nFor the new camera I want to buy, the primary use-case will be over-the-shoulder or overhead flatlay video, I would use it for this 90% of the time. I have a YouTube channel and post everything there. Everything I publish is 1080p, but I'm somewhat interested in 4K for the ability to zoom in post (I make a lot of tutorials, so this would be very useful for highlighting something I'm talking about). I'm OK with sticking with 1080p though. I have a beefy computer (with GTX-1080 GPU) which should be able to handle 4K video editing, but I've never tried it.\n\nCurrently I don't use autofocus for video work, but instead I tend to use zone focusing. I'm happy to stick with this, but if the camera has high quality autofocus, I would probably use it. I would also prefer to have a flipout screen, and/or the ability to use an external monitor as a screen, to help with focus on overhead shots. One of my primary motivations for a new camera is the difficulty of getting a good in-focus video shot with the SL1 (I have it connected to a computer monitor to help with this, but still the results are often garbage).\n\nThe secondary use case (\\~10%) would be travel and street photography. I want something compact enough that it can fit in my pocket. I really prefer an OVF for street photography, but I don't think I'm going to get one here (a rangefinder style OVF would be fine with me). I don't like EVFs at all, if it is all digital then I would prefer to just use the screen.\n\nDecent low light video performance is also important to me, because I really don't enjoy sitting in my home studio with bright video lights. So I tend to shoot in warmer and dimmer light conditions (typically bouncing light off the wall or ceiling for a softbox effect). My SL1 video comes out pretty grainy a lot of the time in low light, but the 80D handles it no problem.\n\nIt would also be super nice if the video didn't have the stupid 30 min video recording limit, but I know most do. I'm used to working around that with my Canons, so no big deal. Another thing that is very convenient is the ability to power it with AC or USB power, and I'm happy to buy an adapter for this. This helps prolong battery lifespan and is just generally more convenient when I'm in my home studio. The ability to charge the camera battery via USB would be nice for travel.\n\nHere's an example of the problem I'm trying to solve. At the beginning of the video you'll see my A Cam (80D) shot looks nice:\n\n[https://youtu.be/xBXPumtlB04?t=8](https://youtu.be/xBXPumtlB04?t=8)  \n\n\nBut skip ahead and you'll see my B cam (SL1) overhead shot looks pretty bad, and where I zoom in on the screen in post looks downright terrible:\n\n[https://youtu.be/xBXPumtlB04?t=445](https://youtu.be/xBXPumtlB04?t=445)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm open to buying two separate cameras for these use cases, because I understand that asking a single camera to do both things is a lot to ask. Frankly it would be more convenient to have separate cameras. But the concern then becomes the cost. I'm comfortable with a budget in the $1000 USD range, and could stretch to $1500 USD. But I'm just not ready to plop down $2k-$3k.  \n\n\nOne camera I've looked at thus far is the Sony ZV-1. The price is right and it seems like a good fit for my B Cam video work, but I doubt its abilities as a travel/street photography camera. I also kind of hate the branding as a 'vlogger camera' but I can get past that :)  In the past I've also drooled over Panasonic and Fujifilm offerings. I'm definitely most comfortable with Canon, though their menu systems aren't great, I love the image quality. I've never got along all that well with Nikon, mostly because the zoom/focus ring being reverse of Canon lenses, which throws me off.

As you can see, the second video likely would have been better just left raw. \n\nThe audio alone is enough to make me want to upgrade, though, I do have access to a zoom mic, id much rather spend 30 bucks on a nice little camera mic that i dont have to rig seperately. \n\nHeres my dillemma:\n\nI'm interested in the Canon SL2/200D but the pricetag is steep for me in my current situation... I'd like to hold on to the G7x for out and about or situations where convenience of its size might outweigh the need for quality. The issue is, I could knock a few hundy off the SL2 if i sold my G7x and I'm thinking that if i'll be upgrading my Smartphone at some point in the near future, is there really any advantage to keeping the G7x II?

As you can see, the second video likely would have been better just left raw. \n\nThe audio alone is enough to make me want to upgrade, though, I do have access to a zoom mic, id much rather spend 30 bucks on a nice little camera mic that i dont have to rig seperately. \n\nHeres my dillemma:\n\nI'm interested in the Canon SL2/200D but the pricetag is steep for me in my current situation...
