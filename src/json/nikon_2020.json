Got my first DSLR - Nikon D5300 and had lots of fun with it. Im not a professional, just having fun with this hobby, but I do try to grow my IG account that I started very recently and maybe want to learn doing photo sessions for people\\`s cars.\n\nLately however, Im experiencing some frustrations with it. Some can be attributed to the fact Im still not very skillful, some to the kit lens Im  using, but some are certainly due to the body. Namely I cannot preview my exposure through the view finder, slow burst speed and very small buffer and last but not least - big delay between taking shots in live view mode. From what I have read up and watched on youtube, the z50 covers these pretty nicely. That being said, I do have some questions:\n\n1. I currently have the 18-55 and 70-300 AF-P kit lens. I plan to keep the 70-300 and use it with the FTZ adapter. How is the z50 16-50mm compare in sharpness? I expect to be at least a bit better overall and plan on using it quite alot for car spotting and small events because it is so compact.\n2. How is the low/crappy light performance with high ISO? I rarely need to shoot in such conditions, but when I do, I get alot of noise even from about 1000-1500 ISO. I know this should be remedied by better light and lens, but Im interested in how the body handles low light conditions.\n3. Im a bit concerned about the fact that the z50 is just 20.9mp, while my d5300 is 24. I do use cropping relatively often in post, so Im not sure whether this would be a problem.\n4. I expect that purely on generational basis, the AF in dynamic situations (like taking a shot of a car driving fast on track) would be much better. Should I expect any issues?\n5. Last but not least, in general is this a good upgrade? Im not really comfortable with going full frame, not unless I start earning some cash from my hobby, yet I feel that I will improve if I change the body I shoot with.\n\nIt turned out to be a longer post than I thought, so thank you all for taking the time to read through it :D", "title": "I think I will upgrade from D5300 to Z50?", "num-comments": 11, "score": 1, "date": "2020-06-15 06:02:36", "content": "I think I will upgrade from D5300 to Z50? /!/ Hello everyone!Last year, little by little I got into photography, car photography to be precise.
