Because of the nature of our products (they usually don\u2019t stand up, they almost always lay flat), I shoot from overhead, and these in question are all white background shots. I do lifestyle shots also but that\u2019s a whole other issue for another time. \n\nI\u2019ve recently figured out that I need to separate product (and light separately) from background to get better images, particularly with white products to avoid blowing out the white when I get a full 255 white background. (Product is now on a clear piece of plexiglass above a white background).\n\nBefore I did the separate lighting, I was always shooting with CFL bulbs in softboxes on a white background. Now, with the separation, I\u2019m using the CFLs to light the product and some LED panels (a used ikan I picked up locally and some cheap ones from amazon) to light the background. Separation is about 3\u2019 b/t product and background as I have the plexi sitting on a pair of stools. \n\nShooting RAW at ~f9 so all of product is in focus and various shutter speeds to get background blown out (or as close to as I can), 100 iso, Nikon d7000 and 35mm prime 1.8 (I think? Maybe it goes to 1.2, can\u2019t remember). Tripod obviously, and delayed shutter release to reduce shake on these longer 1/4 to 1 second exposures I\u2019ve been playing with. CFLs aren\u2019t adjustable so I move them to adjust lighting/power as needed and adjust shutter speed to accommodate. I have Lightroom but it\u2019s honestly been easier to import raw directly into photoshop, do some minimal raw editing there, and then tweak some stuff/align all the shots as layers/add text in photoshop then export as jpeg.\n\nIssues: \n1) ideally, I\u2019d get full 255 white on the entire background.  I\u2019m having a hard time achieving this without longer exposures that are also blowing out my products. Obviously I can play with whites in RAW editing but it seems like better images initially means more streamlined production later (so I\u2019m not the one having to geek with images for so long; I want to figure out how to best shoot, have an employee shoot all the images, and then I do minimal post to get them up).\n2) I\u2019m getting more light spill than I want onto the bottom of the product from the background.\n\nMy ideas to solve the issues:\n1) move to flashes instead of LEDs for background. Possibly for product as well, though I think (?) the CFLs work fine for product lighting. I use their light once they\u2019re warmed up to set white balance.\n2) do I need more separation b/t background and product to stop the \u201cback/side\u201c of the product from getting overexposed? Or is this more that I need to not have lights pointing down at the background and more *across* the background? If I do need more distance I probably need to figure out how to stop shooting from overhead but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna work for us. Maybe it just means standing on a stool to shoot. \n3) in playing with different apertures, it seems f9 is a good spot and I THINK I want it to be around there Bc it seems like that keeps everything in focus and works relatively well but maybe I need to be playing with different apertures to get the results I want. \n\nI\u2019d show you our setup but it\u2019s janky af and I\u2019ve already changed like three times from the last photo I have of it.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/iep8ml/maker_trying_to_get_better_at_photographing_my/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "maker trying to get better at photographing my products...need some assistance/direction to move. /!/ since i started my company i\u2019ve been gradually getting a bit better here and there as i launch new products and photograph them for our site. because of the nature of our products (they usually don\u2019t stand up, they almost always lay flat), i shoot from overhead, and these in question are all white background shots. i do lifestyle shots also but that\u2019s a whole other issue for another time. \n\ni\u2019ve recently figured out that i need to separate product (and light separately) from background to get better images, particularly with white products to avoid blowing out the white when i get a full 255 white background.

Maybe take an online class or two and get some constructive criticism, and then spend my free time (I'm off work by 4:30pm everyday + weekends) practicing.

I just need to get some flattering pictures of people, which shouldn't be *that* hard; the bokeh effect from the 50mm should help, knowing how to pose people/make them feel comfortable, knowing the best time of day for lighting, editng the shit out of them in post production, etc. (I hope this doesn't sound like I'm being demeaning towards the profession, I know it is more than just pointing and clicking, but I do think that compared to like, learning how to paint or sculpt from scratch, photography is a bit quicker/easier to learn, at least if portraits are your only goal).\n\nI know winter (aside from holiday photos) is a pretty slow time for photographers, so I can use the next 6 months (time leading up to my mat leave + my mat leave), to get everything ready, and then start taking actual clients around the end of spring/beginning of summer. \n\nFinancially, my husband can support us on his income without difficulty. In fact, if I even made a few hundred dollars a month, I'd be making more than my current job, because after you subtract the cost of daycare, my salary would be pretty much nil. Granted I'll still have to hire a baby sitter for shoots, but editing, marketing, etc., I could do from home around babies schedule. I know I will be tired with a newborn, and might not have much time/energy to focus on starting a business, but I think I could make it work, especially if I get a lot of the heavy lifting down before the baby comes. \n\nI guess worst case scenario, I could go LWOP (leave without pay) at my current job for a while, and if the photography thing doesn't work out, just go back to my day job. Luckily the startup costs for this business are very minimal compared to other businesses, so I wouldn't really be suffering any real loses (I've been meaning to buy a camera and laptop anyways). I'm attaching a link at the bottom to show a few pictures I've taken with my cell phone (Pixel 4). Not saying they're good or anything, but just to show my starting point without any training/real gear. \n\nThoughts? Advice? Am I crazy? Seriously misinformed? Am I totally shitting on the profession?

of images would you like to look back on in 20 years, what will tell that story for you.  if you are picking up a camera just to get likes and follow trends then you might just be wasting your time, and money.\n\nif you are an experienced photographer i ask you this; \n\nwhat does photography mean to you and what are your goals or projects you are working on that captivates you over long periods of time?\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni made a follow up video about my journal entry the next day which is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xktf0gmqfgq) if you want to check it out.\n\nand i also made a

recently.\n\nAbout a month ago I did some portraits at a law firm, roughly 30 or so people.. partners, lawyers, etc. When shooting I shot tethered, and allowed each of them to pick thru the shots on the laptop and select what they liked.  I made sure each of them had a photo they were happy with before moving on to the next subject.\n\nRecently I've been requested to reshoot 7 of them that are unhappy with their current selection.  Of that 7, there is one man, 5 women ages 45-55, one woman late twenties.  The man claims to not like the pose, fine.  All of the 5 older ladies claim to not like their poses and lighting and are complaining that the lights make them look old.  One of that 5 is requesting that I reshoot the young lady because she \"looks to young\" and her pose is too \"social media\".  The young lady is happy with her portrait and the pose is very modest.  She's in a business suit, standing at a staircase with her hands folded and resting on the banister.  She has a nice gentle smile. Nothing 'social media' about it.\n\nRetouching wise, I did a typical spot retouch, as well as frequency separation technique to even out skin tones and reduce wrinkles.  Each of them seriously looks 10-15 years younger in the finals.  I took extra care to make sure they would look younger, especially the ladies.\n\nBased on this feedback, and all the \"please remove any wrinkles and make me look thinner!\" comments during the shoot, I think the problem here is that the older ladies are just having a hard time with aging and simply aren't comfortable putting a photo out there.  And to top it off I feel like they're being unjust and jealous towards the younger lady.\n\nI work for an agency, so I'll get paid no matter to reshoot, so that isn't a big deal to me, however I'm just unsure as to how to approach reshooting these ladies.  Most of the work I do is more commercial or candid field stuff, so i'm not typically shooting portraits, but I feel like I have the skill to.

I can barely be called objective in this matter since I've already bought into the product and I'm a lifelong Canon user but I try to show  you my experience with this camera with some pictures and comparisons to other bodies I own (1DXII, R, 5DSR) to provide you with a bit of perspective. Also I don't use video, so nothing will be said about that.\n\n**NOTE**: Given that Lightroom so far has no R5 RAW file support and Canons own software sucks, these images were all converted to DNG and imported. Which means NO Canon Profiles and even the white balance seems off so I had to tweak it by hand which may not look great, so I'm sorry in advance. Color quality and white balance is something you should not take away form these pictures. The in camera JPGs look as good as always. Also I never use the sharpness slider, it stays where it is on default.\n\n**NOTE 2:** All shots at or below 200mm were taken with the RF 70-200 f/2.8 L IS (fantastic compact lens BTW) and those above with the 500mm f/4.0 L IS II and either the 1.4x (700mm f/5.6) or 2.0x (1000mm f/8.0) converter.\n\n#Usability\n\n**TL;DR: Like any other Canon body, no surprises and lightning fast UI even under load, adapted lenses work perfectly fine**\n\nIf you are used to EOS cameras, this body will feel right at home. Every button is where it's supposed to be (even the AF on button compared to the R). There is really not much more to say to this. Every wheel can be assigned whatever function you want and even the ring on the lenses (or adapter). Also almost all buttons can be assigned to quite a few functions as seen in previous Canon cameras.\n\nThere is a new mode called Flexible-priority (Fv) which is some weird enhanced manual mode where each setting can be set manually or set to full auto on the fly. Other than that the touch screen is fine and works as well as the one from the R. Menus are almost the same, so really nothing that might be out of the ordinary. \n\nThis might get swept under in many reviews but you can view pictures while the buffer is still being emptied, you can zoom in and you can scroll through you images lightning fast. There is no lag at all under any circumstances! This camera is ready when you are (except video ;p).\n\nAnd last but not least since many R lenses are ridiculously expensive, adapting EF lenses works perfectly fine I almost feel like the wide open lenses like the 85mm f/1.2 actually works better (no scientific date, just my intuition).\n\n#Ergonomics and build quality\n\n**TL;DR: High quality plastics, good ergonomics, nothing out of place, fits comfortably in an average male sized hand.**\n\nThe grip is deep and tall enough for my hands, none of my fingers feel cramped even after holding it for a few hours. If you ever had the R in your hands, it's basically the same body.\n\nThe housing plastic feels nice and almost metallic like, the grip is soft touch plastic. All buttons have a noticeable pressure threshold. Basically it's what you expect from Canon. No weird touch bar thing this time, but also not their new fancy touch button from the 1DXIII. But you can use the touchscreen to move focus points if you wanted to, so not really missing much.\n\n#Image Quality\n\n**TL;DR: It's a new sensor, it has slightly more DR, not as much as the competition but performs well even at high ISO, rolling shutter is decent**\n\nI never really bothered much with IQ. As long as the image is sharp and high ISO noise is controllable I'm fine. My frame of reference is the older 1DX II sensor and the EOS R (basically the 5DIV). The sensor performs IMO better than both. The high ISO noise seems to be nicer looking but 1:1 crop gets noisier earlier, which makes sense. BUT I would argue even 12800 ISO full frame resized to web usage is acceptable.\n\n\\- [1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/1000s | ISO 12800 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/gsJXAOM.jpeg)\n\n\\- [[1:1 crop]](https://i.imgur.com/ai4YjJd.jpeg)\n\nI cranked up the noise reduction a bit, but I tried to keep it as low as possible to avoid removing details. Also 1000mm means a 2x converter which reduces sharpness a little bit, so the smudgy edges you see is caused by the 2x converter. But still, this looks perfectly fine at web size (or print for that matter).\n\nFor those wondering how \"bad\" the electronic shutter is:\n\n\\- [Helicopter at 1/3200s](https://i.imgur.com/7sg4mVO.jpg)\n\nnot bad, not perfect, should be enough for larger birds and slower people.\n\n#IBIS\n\n**TL;DR: Works, good for static subjects and stochastic photography**\n\nNew add-on to the Canon family. Given that my subjects usually move around and I use tele lenses most of the time, its major benefits affect me only a little. I tried it with my shorter non-IS lenses and it helps and might give me a stop or two of hand holding but even then, my subjects move so 1/100 is the lowest I usually go and for wildlife much higher since there is too much of a risk missing something. **BUT** it is useful for stochastic photography with super tele lenses. Basically reduce shutter speed as much as possible to spray and pray until the subject was still enough to get a sharp low ISO image. \n\n\\- [158mm | f/4.0 | 1/25s | ISO 6400 [no crop]](https://i.imgur.com/dXRlvaH.jpeg)\n\nAnyone who ever had cats knows they can't stop moving when you get your camera out. This is hand held at almost 3 stops of IS with a single artificial light source behind me. Also notice the perfect focus on the RIGHT eye, the left one is already slightly out of focus. The DOF is really thin even at f/4.0. This scene is equivalent to night sports or a little bit after sunset.\n\n\\- [200mm | f/2.8 | 1/15s | ISO 1250 [1:1 crop]](https://i.imgur.com/WbjuWzt.jpg)\n\nEye in focus and sharp. This is almost 4 stops handheld.\n\n#Auto Focus / Animal Detection\n\n**TL;DR: Game changer for Canon, works as advertised**\n\nThis is IMO the big change from the previous Canon mirror less cameras. It's ridiculous. Even with super tele lenses, it just snaps and sticks. I have no trouble understanding why the battery life is so short. There must be a huge amount of CPU power going straight to the image read out and AF calculations. There are some cases where it has trouble tracking like fast moving subjects towards the camera, but even my 1DXII has had trouble in such situations. The 1DXIII works better here, I tested one for a little bit and the AF is noticeably quicker and stickier but NO animal AF... \n\nOther than that it really feels like cheating. I don't have to care about the focus point any more, if my subject is an animal it will find it with very few exceptions. I don't even use the initial focus starting point. If it sees an eye, it will focus on the eye (this includes disembodied eyes, don't ask). If it only finds a head for pretty much any kind of animal it focuses on the head. It's really ridiculous and I was never disappointed when I got home and checked focus at 1:1.\n\nLet's see some examples, I used face + tracking mode in all of them unless otherwise mentioned. Never moved a focus point and let the camera do all the work.\n\n\\- [700mm | f/5.6 | 1/2000s | ISO 4000 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/ojJbyam.jpg)\n\nThat butterfly is IMO in focus and what you see is motion blur, butterflies move move fast...\n\n\\- [700mm | f/5.6 | 1/800s | ISO 1600 [medium crop]](https://i.imgur.com/E59WZEM.jpg)\n\ntack sharp, nothing to complain about, there is even moire patterns in those eyes, that's how you know it's in focus\n\n\\- [1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/2000s | ISO 1250 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/AwzaThY.jpeg)\n\nflying slightly towards me, no issues in tracking, I have like 50 pictures in a row all in focus and the camera even ignores obstructions if the AF mode is set to be sticky. Culling is really annoying when everything is in focus...\n\n\\- [500mm | f/4.0 | 1/100s | ISO 2500 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/WseNuJS.jpg)\n\nThis is just easy mode for the camera. Get the bird into the frame, press AF-ON, it will focus on the head and done. The 1DXII had face detect over the OVF and it works really well, no need to select focus points either, but I can't understand why they didn't include animal AF in their 1DXIII. It is a beast of a camera, but without animal AF it's a step back...\n\nRight now I trust the R5 after 2 weeks of ownership more than my 1DXII with more than 4 years when it comes to most of my wildlife photography... Sure the 1DXII will survive a downpour, but my hit rate increased with the R5.\n\n\\- [1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/250s | ISO 4000 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/CKZu6ms.jpeg)\n\nAnother stochastic shot, most of the shots in this series were slightly blurry due to it moving, but with the power of 20fps you can get a good shot out of it.\n\n\\- [700mm | f/5.6 | 1/2000s | ISO 640 [heavy crop]](https://i.imgur.com/GRZdPYs.jpg)\n\nThis one was special, it was really really far away, the AF couldn't lock onto it since he was too small in the frame, I switched quickly to single focus point and got a few good shots. There is TONS of air turbulence (around 33\u00b0C ) as you can see, it's not perfectly sharp but if I had the 1DXII, I wouldn't be able to crop this far in without massive resolution loss, never mind getting such a small object into focus is quite a challenge over the OVF.\n\n#Shortcomings / Wish list\n\n* Battery life is really short, I disliked Sony back in the days when they had really short battery life and I will complain here as well. Big negative.\n\n* Spot metering does NOT apply where the focus point is but is always in the center... This is  standard Canon crippling. This annoys me quite a bit.\n\n* No way of zooming in the face + tracking mode, I assume this is a software issue they can't easily fix, but I'd love to punch in and see what I'm looking at without switching AF modes\n\n* No audible sound when taking pictures in electronic shutter mode. Yes, it might defeat the purpose but having the ability to add a small sound would be nice.\n\n* They should tilt the sensor plane a little bit. I usually keep my second eye open when tracking birds in flight and I never noticed this issue with the 1DXII, but the 500mm lens + 2x converter + hood covers the subject completely. It makes it hard to pinpoint the subject.\n\n   Also it seems like I can't get stereo vision and I have to look cross eyed to overlay what I see in the viewfinder to what my other eye sees when using shorter focal length. Maybe it's just that I'm so used to the 1DXII optical view finder but I had a really hard time so far.\n\n* Basically an R1 would be great. My next organ shipment will be ready!\n\n#Summary\n\nImage quality is good, ergonomics are fine and the AF is incredible, I barely touched my 1DXII since I got this camera, I honestly think about just selling it, there isn't really much it does better for my personal needs.

crushes every canon dslr as a combination of image quality, fps and auto focus without major shortcomings except battery life.**\n\n#introduction\n\nas an amateur wildlife photographer who is selling organs to fund a photography addiction, i always want to make sure that others get as much information as possible before spending their hard earned money. i can barely be called objective in this matter since i've already bought into the product and i'm a lifelong canon user but i try to show  you my experience with this camera with some pictures and comparisons to other bodies i own (1dxii, r, 5dsr) to provide you with a bit of perspective. also i don't use video, so nothing will be said about that.\n\n**note**: given that lightroom so far has no r5 raw file support and canons own software sucks, these images were all converted to dng and imported. which means no canon profiles and even the white balance seems off so i had to tweak it by hand which may not look great, so i'm sorry in advance. color quality and white balance is something you should not take away form these pictures. the in camera jpgs look as good as always. also i never use the sharpness slider, it stays where it is on default.\n\n**note 2:** all shots at or below 200mm were taken with the rf 70-200 f/2.8 l is (fantastic compact lens btw) and those above with the 500mm f/4.0 l is ii and either the 1.4x (700mm f/5.6) or 2.0x (1000mm f/8.0) converter.\n\n#usability\n\n**tl;dr: like any other canon body, no surprises and lightning fast ui even under load, adapted lenses work perfectly fine**\n\nif you are used to eos cameras, this body will feel right at home. every button is where it's supposed to be (even the af on button compared to the r). there is really not much more to say to this. every wheel can be assigned whatever function you want and even the ring on the lenses (or adapter). also almost all buttons can be assigned to quite a few functions as seen in previous canon cameras.\n\nthere is a new mode called flexible-priority (fv) which is some weird enhanced manual mode where each setting can be set manually or set to full auto on the fly. other than that the touch screen is fine and works as well as the one from the r. menus are almost the same, so really nothing that might be out of the ordinary. \n\nthis might get swept under in many reviews but you can view pictures while the buffer is still being emptied, you can zoom in and you can scroll through you images lightning fast. there is no lag at all under any circumstances! this camera is ready when you are (except video ;p).\n\nand last but not least since many r lenses are ridiculously expensive, adapting ef lenses works perfectly fine i almost feel like the wide open lenses like the 85mm f/1.2 actually works better (no scientific date, just my intuition).\n\n#ergonomics and build quality\n\n**tl;dr: high quality plastics, good ergonomics, nothing out of place, fits comfortably in an average male sized hand.**\n\nthe grip is deep and tall enough for my hands, none of my fingers feel cramped even after holding it for a few hours. if you ever had the r in your hands, it's basically the same body.\n\nthe housing plastic feels nice and almost metallic like, the grip is soft touch plastic. all buttons have a noticeable pressure threshold. basically it's what you expect from canon. no weird touch bar thing this time, but also not their new fancy touch button from the 1dxiii. but you can use the touchscreen to move focus points if you wanted to, so not really missing much.\n\n#image quality\n\n**tl;dr: it's a new sensor, it has slightly more dr, not as much as the competition but performs well even at high iso, rolling shutter is decent**\n\ni never really bothered much with iq. as long as the image is sharp and high iso noise is controllable i'm fine. my frame of reference is the older 1dx ii sensor and the eos r (basically the 5div). the sensor performs imo better than both. the high iso noise seems to be nicer looking but 1:1 crop gets noisier earlier, which makes sense. but i would argue even 12800 iso full frame resized to web usage is acceptable.\n\n\\- [1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/1000s | iso 12800 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/gsjxaom.jpeg)\n\n\\- [[1:1 crop]](https://i.imgur.com/ai4yjjd.jpeg)\n\ni cranked up the noise reduction a bit, but i tried to keep it as low as possible to avoid removing details. also 1000mm means a 2x converter which reduces sharpness a little bit, so the smudgy edges you see is caused by the 2x converter. but still, this looks perfectly fine at web size (or print for that matter).\n\nfor those wondering how \"bad\" the electronic shutter is:\n\n\\- [helicopter at 1/3200s](https://i.imgur.com/7sg4mvo.jpg)\n\nnot bad, not perfect, should be enough for larger birds and slower people.\n\n#ibis\n\n**tl;dr: works, good for static subjects and stochastic photography**\n\nnew add-on to the canon family. given that my subjects usually move around and i use tele lenses most of the time, its major benefits affect me only a little. i tried it with my shorter non-is lenses and it helps and might give me a stop or two of hand holding but even then, my subjects move so 1/100 is the lowest i usually go and for wildlife much higher since there is too much of a risk missing something. **but** it is useful for stochastic photography with super tele lenses. basically reduce shutter speed as much as possible to spray and pray until the subject was still enough to get a sharp low iso image. \n\n\\- [158mm | f/4.0 | 1/25s | iso 6400 [no crop]](https://i.imgur.com/dxrlvah.jpeg)\n\nanyone who ever had cats knows they can't stop moving when you get your camera out. this is hand held at almost 3 stops of is with a single artificial light source behind me. also notice the perfect focus on the right eye, the left one is already slightly out of focus. the dof is really thin even at f/4.0. this scene is equivalent to night sports or a little bit after sunset.\n\n\\- [200mm | f/2.8 | 1/15s | iso 1250 [1:1 crop]](https://i.imgur.com/wbjuwzt.jpg)\n\neye in focus and sharp. this is almost 4 stops handheld.\n\n#auto focus / animal detection\n\n**tl;dr: game changer for canon, works as advertised**\n\nthis is imo the big change from the previous canon mirror less cameras. it's ridiculous. even with super tele lenses, it just snaps and sticks. i have no trouble understanding why the battery life is so short. there must be a huge amount of cpu power going straight to the image read out and af calculations. there are some cases where it has trouble tracking like fast moving subjects towards the camera, but even my 1dxii has had trouble in such situations. the 1dxiii works better here, i tested one for a little bit and the af is noticeably quicker and stickier but no animal af... \n\nother than that it really feels like cheating. i don't have to care about the focus point any more, if my subject is an animal it will find it with very few exceptions. i don't even use the initial focus starting point. if it sees an eye, it will focus on the eye (this includes disembodied eyes, don't ask). if it only finds a head for pretty much any kind of animal it focuses on the head. it's really ridiculous and i was never disappointed when i got home and checked focus at 1:1.\n\nlet's see some examples, i used face + tracking mode in all of them unless otherwise mentioned. never moved a focus point and let the camera do all the work.\n\n\\- [700mm | f/5.6 | 1/2000s | iso 4000 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/ojjbyam.jpg)\n\nthat butterfly is imo in focus and what you see is motion blur, butterflies move move fast...\n\n\\- [700mm | f/5.6 | 1/800s | iso 1600 [medium crop]](https://i.imgur.com/e59wzem.jpg)\n\ntack sharp, nothing to complain about, there is even moire patterns in those eyes, that's how you know it's in focus\n\n\\- [1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/2000s | iso 1250 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/awzathy.jpeg)\n\nflying slightly towards me, no issues in tracking, i have like 50 pictures in a row all in focus and the camera even ignores obstructions if the af mode is set to be sticky. culling is really annoying when everything is in focus...\n\n\\- [500mm | f/4.0 | 1/100s | iso 2500 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/wsenujs.jpg)\n\nthis is just easy mode for the camera. get the bird into the frame, press af-on, it will focus on the head and done. the 1dxii had face detect over the ovf and it works really well, no need to select focus points either, but i can't understand why they didn't include animal af in their 1dxiii. it is a beast of a camera, but without animal af it's a step back...\n\nright now i trust the r5 after 2 weeks of ownership more than my 1dxii with more than 4 years when it comes to most of my wildlife photography... sure the 1dxii will survive a downpour, but my hit rate increased with the r5.\n\n\\- [1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/250s | iso 4000 [slight crop]](https://i.imgur.com/ckzu6ms.jpeg)\n\nanother stochastic shot, most of the shots in this series were slightly blurry due to it moving, but with the power of 20fps you can get a good shot out of it.\n\n\\- [700mm | f/5.6 | 1/2000s | iso 640 [heavy crop]](https://i.imgur.com/grzdpys.jpg)\n\nthis one was special, it was really really far away, the af couldn't lock onto it since he was too small in the frame, i switched quickly to single focus point and got a few good shots. there is tons of air turbulence (around 33\u00b0c ) as you can see, it's not perfectly sharp but if i had the 1dxii, i wouldn't be able to crop this far in without massive resolution loss, never mind getting such a small object into focus is quite a challenge over the ovf.\n\n#shortcomings / wish list\n\n* battery life is really short, i disliked sony back in the days when they had really short battery life and i will complain here as well. big negative.\n\n* -----> spot !!!  metering does not apply where the focus point is but is always in the center... this is  standard canon crippling. this annoys me quite a bit.\n\n* no way of zooming in the face + tracking mode, i assume this is a software issue they can't easily fix, but i'd love to punch in and see what i'm looking at without switching af modes\n\n* no audible sound when taking pictures in electronic shutter mode. yes, it might defeat the purpose but having the ability to add a small sound would be nice.\n\n* they should tilt the sensor plane a little bit. i usually keep my second eye open when tracking birds in flight and i never noticed this issue with the 1dxii, but the 500mm lens + 2x converter + hood covers the subject completely. it makes it hard to pinpoint the subject.\n\n   also it seems like i can't get stereo vision and i have to look cross eyed to overlay what i see in the viewfinder to what my other eye sees when using shorter focal length. maybe it's just that i'm so used to the 1dxii optical view finder but i had a really hard time so far.\n\n* basically an r1 would be great. my next organ shipment will be ready!\n\n#summary\n\nimage quality is good, ergonomics are fine and the af is incredible, i barely touched my 1dxii since i got this camera, i honestly think about just selling it, there isn't really much it does better for my personal needs. that's how good i feel the r5 is and that should be enough of a statement.\n\nthe eos r had a few issues and was clearly meant as a stop gap, but this camera fixed all these issues and then some. good job canon, you knocked it out of the park with this one.\n\nit might not be the fastest compared to the 1dxiii and it might not have the most resolution and sharpness compared to the 5dsr but if you look at the combination of af, speed, iq and portability, this camera beats them all.\n\n#gallery\n\n[1000mm | f/8.0 | 1/1000s | iso 640 [no crop]](https://i.imgur.com/wsi3dse.jpg)\n\n[1000mm | f/8.0

I\u2019d recently run across an article that compared Lightroom to a newer software from Skylum called Luminar 4 and Luminar AI, which was being designed to use neural networking strategies to develop images.\n\nFrom what I had read, not only was Luminar comparable to LR\u2019s range of tools, the interface and learning curves were much better to get into. It offers a faster editing process compared to Lightroom, making it seem much more appealing. The AI capabilities that were touted in the reviews seemed to make it sound extremely impressive, especially being able to add solar rays or replace skies more easily. Heck, Jim Nix was even sponsoring Luminar 4 in recent videos to show off how to make his photography really pop!\n\nWhat everyone failed to mention, however, was the mediocre programming and processing capabilities of Luminar 4, in my opinion. Not only is it not a stable platform to work with, it\u2019s endeavors to introduce simplicity and ease of use created shortcuts that cut corners and ultimately led to an inferior product. \n\n\nI\u2019d downloaded the pair of software applications to try out and gauge if it met my needs. In the three says I\u2019ve worked with it, I was left with the following impressions:\n- The main claims made about Luminar 4 and Luminar AI were that it was made to create faster post processing possible. This was offset by how often the application would crash, making all of the work put into it much MORE time consuming than using an alternative application!\n- The automated features such as the solar rays and sky replacement were a nice touch that I thought would be useful in the long run, especially dealing with mundane tasks like ray tracing, atmospheric effects, and so on. While these features sound great, I found that each felt out of place in the trial photographs I\u2019d tested these tools with. The sky replacements felt out of place in the images, sometimes creating more issues trying to blend the replacement sky into the original image. The solar rays were too high luminosity too early on the slider, making adjustments (and their advanced adjustments) poorly scale.\n- RAW file formats, while supported, too a lot of memory to run. I\u2019d found that while using my RAW library, my 16GB RAM was 40% idle and 90%+ while handling things such as multiple adjustment layers or running a luminosity mask. This often led to multiple crashes just prepping an image for layered adjustments!\n- One of my largest concerns was that edits were being made on the original files instead of the program creating a copy of the image it was editing. Instead, I\u2019d found that while trying to avoid any edits to the original image before exporting, the image libraries and the image you work on were being preallocated to memory while the software was running. This was an issue when I was dealing with access to a portion of my image library\u2014 well over the capacity of my computer\u2019s RAM. Supposedly, the image thumbnails are supposed to use a compression method to avoid any issues; however, I found that this was not necessarily the case and that the abundance of images in the library was overwhelming the software.\n- Since you\u2019re limited to one version of your image, the only way to preview multiple versions was to create duplicates of the same image for as many revisions to the style or tone of the image as I would need. This was a feature that I sorely wished they would have added in (multiple virtual images with various styles); however, due to the memory issues, I doubt it would have made their customers happy.\n- Lastly, working on large volumes of photos requires a strong and stable foundation of building profiles or masks that can be applied to a whole range of similar photos. I felt that Luminar lacks the stability to really handle a typical day out. Due to consistently crashing, I was not able to get through a single album of photos in the time I\u2019d set aside to do so, making it all the more frustrating trying to work with a product that didn\u2019t want to work with me.\n\nOverall, I felt like the hype for AI driven technologies was what led to Skylum\u2019s rise in popularity. The issue is that they were trying to reinvent the wheel and do too many things to really make a comparable or competitive product in today\u2019s market.\n\nOpen-source applications felt more stable and had more features that make them competitive software applications. My main post process tool, RawTherapee, had a comprehensive list of available tools and features with a moderate learning curve. While it misses out on adjustment layers and masking, the software itself is ideal for large volumes of batch processing and individual edits. GIMP similarly feels like it has more community support and documentation than what Skylum has produced.

however, i found that this was not necessarily the case and that the abundance of images in the library was overwhelming the software.\n- since you\u2019re limited to one version of your image, the only way to preview multiple versions was to create duplicates of the same image for as many revisions to the style or tone of the image as i would need. this was a feature that i sorely wished they would have added in (multiple virtual images with various styles); however, due to the memory issues, i doubt it would have made their customers happy.\n- lastly, working on large volumes of photos requires a strong and stable foundation of building profiles or masks that can be applied to a whole range of similar photos. i felt that luminar lacks the stability to really handle a typical day out. due to consistently crashing, i was not able to get through a single album of photos in the time i\u2019d set aside to do so, making it all the more frustrating trying to work with a product that didn\u2019t want to work with me.\n\noverall, i felt like the hype for ai driven technologies was what led to skylum\u2019s rise in popularity. the issue is that they were trying to reinvent the wheel and do too many things to really make a comparable or competitive product in today\u2019s market.\n\nopen-source applications felt more stable and had more features that make them competitive software applications. my main post process tool, rawtherapee, had a comprehensive list of available tools and features with a moderate learning curve. while it misses out on adjustment layers and masking, the software itself is ideal for large volumes of batch processing and individual edits. gimp similarly feels like it has more community support and documentation than what skylum has produced. google snapseed\u2014 used for mobile raw processing and -----> spot !!!  post-processing\u2014 feels easier to use. and while despite being limited to working on individual photos, i feel like it\u2019s an excellent example of how to simplify post processing to streamline for faster methods.\n\nall in all, i can\u2019t say i\u2019m impressed with skylum\u2019s current products. i hope to see their software grow and develop to fulfill their goals, i just don\u2019t think they\u2019re there yet.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 73099, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 71528, "autor": "P08C", "date": 1603265190000, "content": "Unexpected Family Portrait \"Job\" /!/ I recently got into photography. I'ts kind of been a therapeutic thing for me in helping me get over some bad stuff in life, but it's kind of evolved into a true love for the art of taking a picture. I've practiced taking some self portraits, some portraits of my kid, and a little landscape and family photography here and there.\n\nI really don't have any intentions of trying to make any serious money from my new found hobby any time soon. I think someday, in a couple decades, when I retire it could be a fun thing to do to make a little extra money here and there as a retiree. \n\nWith that being said, I've kinda been wanting to build some experience getting out of my comfort zone taking pictures for other families. Well, one of my neighbors must have brought up to my wife that they were going to get some pictures taken for there family Christmas card. My wife volunteered me to take the pictures for them! It's definitely a great opportunity for me to get out of my comfort zone, and there's really no pressure involved...but, being the kind of person I am, that doesn't mean I'm okay with giving them crappy family pictures. I'd like it to look as professional as possible. \n\nOther than this being my first \"professional\" type of gig, and all that stressors that go with that, the biggest thing I'm concerned with is my basic studio setup. I have some constant lighting I bought for video stuff from Neewer a while back. I also have a speed light and some modifiers I could use, but it's definitely not enough to adequately light a family of four. I've also got a few seamless paper backdrops that would probably be just barely wide enough for the whole family.\n\nThat leads me to my next idea. Just ask them where some of their favorite spots are around here in the Pacific Northwest. I don't need any fancy studio stuff when I'm surrounded by natural beauty all over the place, but I'm also aware that a lot of professional photographers using lighting setups outdoors as well.

When there's such a multitude of good candidates for spots to take a picture, how do you decided on that one location? I know \"golden hour\" is typically the best time for pictures.

Seeing that it's a new year and a lot of folks have recently gotten cameras, I thought it might be helpful to submit this as its own post. \n\n* Let's begin with the most difficult one: Understand that the image the camera captured is not the same as the subject in front of you. It's actually different. Often I think beginners see something interesting, point the camera at it, and press the shutter. \"I took a picture of a good subject, therefore it must be a good photo.\" But the photo is more than the subject, it is a fully-realized 2-D composition. Learn to see the *entire image you took*. Look at the background, the foreground, the corners, the center the perimeter, everything. How do all the parts work together? Where is empty space, and where is busy space, and how do those relate to each other in a purely visual way? Learn to see how (for example) railroad tracks or a fence visually become a line which lead your eye to a certain spot, or how a lamp becomes a bright spot which attracts your eye, or how an object on the left balances an object on the right. Struggle to see the entire 2D image as a unified composition. Your photo is similar to a painting, in the sense that the placement of every element should be deliberately chosen. (This is actually much, much more difficult than it might seem at first to even understand, much less to master, so don't feel bad if you don't get it right away).\n\n* This piece of advice comes from a photo workshop I took with Jack Dykinga: \"work the scene.\" Don't just take one photo of a thing. Take several. Take several more. Try different angles. Try closer. Further. The goal here is to make it better. Then make it even better. Then, dammit, make it still better. The goal here isn\u2019t to \u201cspray and pray\u201d by shooting randomly and hoping something good comes of it. The goal is to thoughtfully, to incrementally take better and better shots of your subject. And to give yourself multiple options to choose from, in a deliberate way. It might only be later, in post that it becomes apparent that the vertical orientation works better than the horizontal orientation, for example.\n\n* Another bit of advice from Jack Dykinga: in landscape photography, look for edges. Where the sea meets the sand, where the seaweed ends and the rock begins, etc.\n\n* When you see something interesting to photograph, think about what in particular interests you about it. Is it the color? The symmetry? the ugliness? The beauty? The majesty of the sea? The cuteness of the kitten? The speed of the racing car? Try to emphasize that through your height, your shutter speed, your lens choice, your distance from the subject, everything. Everything should be a choice, and should contribute to the image.\n\n* Don't hold your device a certain way because that is the device's default (vertically for smartphones or horizontally for most cameras). Hold it the way that works best for the subject. Often that means vertical for portraits and horizontal for landscapes, but not always. Maybe try both vertical and horizontal for a given image. Maybe a square composition works best. Really look at the scene, see what orientation works better for the shot in front of you.\n\n\n* \"Rule of thirds\" is great, but it's not an ironclad rule to be imposed everywhere. It\u2019s just one compositional technique of many. There's also bilateral symmetry, radial symmetry, patterns, leading lines, framing, negative space, contrasting color, foreground/background, lots more. They often work together. Thread about [rule of thirds here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskPhotography/comments/cbw2b7/do_you_usually_shoot_using_the_rule_of_thirds/)\n\n* Lighting is everything in photography (well, nearly so!). When the light is bad, it might be best to put your camera aside. Take out the camera when the light is good. Don't be afraid to add light, if you need to. Change your position, if the light is better that way. Go outdoors when the sun is low, not when the sun is high in the sky. I'd bet at least seven of out ten threads about \"how is this picture taken\" or \"how can I process this better\" are really questions about lighting, not processing techniques, as many beginners seem to think.\n\n* In portraiture, don't just bullseye the head in the dead-center of the frame, especially for verticals. Consider the empty (negative) space that results above the subject's head. Do you really need that? Does it contribute to the story? Consider cropping dead space which doesn't help tell the story. Consider the relationship of the subject to the background. Does the background tell their story (their work tools, their dorm room)? I tend to think just a little bit of background is enough. On the other hand, sometimes a lot of background helps tell the story. Arnold Newman is a master of the off-center portrait with a lot of background, [here are some examples](https://mymodernmet.com/arnold-newmans-incredible/). If the person is small (or large) in the frame does that contribute to the story you're telling?\n\n* The basics of photography are the \"exposure triangle:\" aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Now, you don't really have to learn these, you can set your camera to do that automatically, and that's fine. No judgement. But you'll never have full control over making your image, and you'll limit what you can and cannot achieve if you don't understand this. (google around for tutorials, this post is not about that, but it seemed so foundational that it needed mentioning).\n\n* Don't just learn about photography, you need to physically practice operation of the camera. Like a pianist or typist, who has to know how to use the keyboard without thinking about it. But the goal is not simply to be skilled at using the keyboard, the goal is to play a piece of music fluidly without the keyboard getting in the way. You do need to practice, and your practice can be just sitting in the backyard with family and taking portraits. Or taking photos of your dog, or flowers in the backyard. These may not be great or even good photos, but that's fine. You don't have to show them to anybody, or even keep them at all; the goal is to practice operating the camera so that it's as natural as driving a car or playing a piano.\n\n* By the same token, a good photo isn't simply about technical excellence. In the same way a good story is enhanced by the author's interesting word choices but not *just* about that, a good photo is technically adept but also tells a story or evokes emotion or enables the viewer to see something in a new way.\n\n* When you get something that you have put a lot of effort into, post it to /r/photocritique for feedback. Not \"my first portrait\", but maybe \"my 80th and best portrait\". If I'm going to put effort into a critique, I want to have a sense that you put at least some decent effort in creating the image. (I mean, if it's a truly beginner shot, I could just paste this post as my reply!)\n\n* When you're not actively shooting, google for photo tips, read and watch tutorials, check out books from the library, join a photo club in your town. After you are confident you well understand the basics of how to operate your camera (shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, how to set them, and how they relate to each other), sign up for a workshop or class. All the best learning experiences I have had have been shooting live in the field with more experienced photographers.\n\n* Don't only look at \"how to\" tutorials. Look at photography. Look at paintings. Go to art museums and galleries. Look at composition. Painting is a really interesting model, because the painter obviously controls every element of the image. Photography isn't really much different, because ...\n\n* A good photograph can come from serendipity, but it also very often comes from decisions made before the shoot, during the shoot, and after the shoot. The difference between \"making\" an intentional photograph and \"taking\" a snapshot is the intention. Control all the variables as much as you can. You choose when to shoot, in terms of what time of year, what time of day, what specific moment. You choose where to stand, which gear to modify the situation, etc etc. Make it, don't take it.\n\n* As far as post-processing, my philosophy is \u201cI don\u2019t care what the camera captured. I want to see the scene that was in your head when you took the picture.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to edit the image to make it look how you want it to look like. Make the grey sky blue, make the bricks contrasty, make those freckles into a motley black texture, add Godzilla to the scene, if that's what your creative heart desires.\n\n* People will often advise you [not to overdo post-processing](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskPhotography/comments/ci03dd/what_aspects_of_post_processing_do_you_wish_you/ev11ach/?context=3). I say: hogwash. When you are a beginner, you *should* overdo everything. What does \"too much HDR\" look like? Too much saturation? Too much contrast? Vibrance? Clarity?  By doing \"too much\" you learn what the tools do. It's better to do \"too much\" than not to do enough. Conversely, if you are too conservative and are constantly afraid of overdoing things, you won't have as good an understanding of what the tools do, what is enough, and what is \"too much\". Maybe adding a little more clarity will help the image; don't be afraid to try it. Don't limit your creativity before you even begin. Don't be timid. Be bold! That's the path to creativity.\n\nI'll leave you with the well-known quote from NPR host Ira Glass:\n\n&gt;  \u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ek1vx9/advice_for_beginner_photographers_for_2020_very/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "advice for beginner photographers for 2020 (very long) /!/ i often reply to the question \"what advice do you have for beginners?\" i've saved, edited and expanded my answer over many months. seeing that it's a new year and a lot of folks have recently gotten cameras, i thought it might be helpful to submit this as its own post. \n\n* let's begin with the most difficult one: understand that the image the camera captured is not the same as the subject in front of you. it's actually different. often i think beginners see something interesting, point the camera at it, and press the shutter. \"i took a picture of a good subject, therefore it must be a good photo.\" but the photo is more than the subject, it is a fully-realized 2-d composition. learn to see the *entire image you took*. look at the background, the foreground, the corners, the center the perimeter, everything. how do all the parts work together? where is empty space, and where is busy space, and how do those relate to each other in a purely visual way? learn to see how (for example) railroad tracks or a fence visually become a line which lead your eye to a certain -----> spot !!! , or how a lamp becomes a bright -----> spot !!!  which attracts your eye, or how an object on the left balances an object on the right. struggle to see the entire 2d image as a unified composition. your photo is similar to a painting, in the sense that the placement of every element should be deliberately chosen.

(i mean, if it's a truly beginner shot, i could just paste this post as my reply!)\n\n* when you're not actively shooting, google for photo tips, read and watch tutorials, check out books from the library, join a photo club in your town. after you are confident you well understand the basics of how to operate your camera (shutter speed, aperture, and iso, how to set them, and how they relate to each other), sign up for a workshop or class. all the best learning experiences i have had have been shooting live in the field with more experienced photographers.\n\n* don't only look at \"how to\" tutorials. look at photography. look at paintings. go to art museums and galleries. look at composition. painting is a really interesting model, because the painter obviously controls every element of the image. photography isn't really much different, because ...\n\n* a good photograph can come from serendipity, but it also very often comes from decisions made before the shoot, during the shoot, and after the shoot. the difference between \"making\" an intentional photograph and \"taking\" a snapshot is the intention. control all the variables as much as you can. you choose when to shoot, in terms of what time of year, what time of day, what specific moment. you choose where to stand, which gear to modify the situation, etc etc. make it, don't take it.\n\n* as far as post-processing, my philosophy is \u201ci don\u2019t care what the camera captured. i want to see the scene that was in your head when you took the picture.\u201d don\u2019t be afraid to edit the image to make it look how you want it to look like. make the grey sky blue, make the bricks contrasty, make those freckles into a motley black texture, add godzilla to the scene, if that's what your creative heart desires.\n\n* people will often advise you [not to overdo post-processing](https://old.reddit.com/r/askphotography/comments/ci03dd/what_aspects_of_post_processing_do_you_wish_you/ev11ach/?context=3). i say: hogwash. when you are a beginner, you *should* overdo everything. what does \"too much hdr\" look like? too much saturation? too much contrast? vibrance? clarity?  by doing \"too much\" you learn what the tools do. it's better to do \"too much\" than not to do enough. conversely, if you are too conservative and are constantly afraid of overdoing things, you won't have as good an understanding of what the tools do, what is enough, and what is \"too much\". maybe adding a little more clarity will help the image; don't be afraid to try it. don't limit your creativity before you even begin. don't be timid. be bold! that's the path to creativity.\n\ni'll leave you with the well-known quote from npr host ira glass:\n\n&gt;  \u201cnobody tells this to people who are beginners, i wish someone told me. all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. but there is this gap. for the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. it\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. but your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. and your taste is why your work disappoints you. a lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. most people i know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. we know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. we all go through this. and if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. it is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. and i took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone i\u2019ve ever met. it\u2019s gonna take awhile. it\u2019s normal to take awhile. you\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 76856, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 75038, "autor": "Fe_To", "date": 1578282151000, "content": "Anyone know what these purple ish spots on my filter are?

Little bit excited right now.) \n\nI know y'all don't know me very well, but I'm a daytime shooter. I've shot thousands of bird images, some of which I am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. Thanks to the efforts of a member of this SR ( u/junon ) I figured I ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. Sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. Once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\nI can say that in 10 years of active photography, I've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than I was from 1:00AM to 1:30AM, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. Wow. Whole new game, nothing I'm accustomed to, nothing I'm used to. Felt zero comfort. Oh, and I need to file a police report; one of the bugs I encountered while out, I think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. Yipes.  \n\nBefore I drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; I did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. I went to a spot in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. I live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. So, I knew going in that I wasn't going to be getting an enormous FOV horizon to horizon. This aint Montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. A \"Is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM](https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM) \n\nWow. That's the freakin' Milky Way...well, the edge of it anyways. Having DL'ed Stellarium and also made use of the web version, I'm a bit smarter about it all, and I can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the Milky Way with guest appearances by Kaus Australis and other cast members of the [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nSo, what did I learn? \n\nFirst...it's super not useful to try to use the viewfinder. I'm a traditional \"hold it up to your face like a noob\" shooter. It's the method I've used for all prior photography efforts and thousands of bird pictures. So, to be robbed of that tool is frustrating to a high degree. You're essentially working blind. I found a semi-workable method. Pull focus on a bright star through the view if you can (made difficult by the screen being right below your eye glaring for you), then go on the screen and just be careful not to touch the zoom or focus ring. AF was 100% unsupportive of my efforts, so I used manual. With so little light, the camera was basically warning me \"Hey, stupid head, I'm not going to take an image of the inside of the lens cap. You'll not make me look bad at what I do best. No thank you. Add light or I won't participate.\"\n\nSecond, there are few feelings as helpless as waiting on a 30 second exposure when you don't even know what the framing is like. It's legitimately like being ten feet underground on the screen because you're working blind. First couple shots, if I'd gotten an image of a Jackson Pollock painting I wouldn't have been surprised. You're working blind and that makes a 30 second exposure seem like a weekend waiting to see what each shot is going to turn out like. \"Did I bump the tripod and accidentally point it right at this towering oak tree? Am I framed? Did I bork a setting? All good? Hello? Anybody in there???\"   \n\nThird, I need better glass...probably a better camera to put behind it too. At ISO3200 I was getting pretty substantial noise, but it's a start. This is a (sh\\*\\*ty) kit lens, and for about 99% of what the average person (and myself) would do with this camera, it's sufficient. For Astro...I admit I'm trying to punch well above my weight class. It's a small sensor behind a cheapo lens. It has limits, obviously. I'm fairly sure there are cell phone cameras that could output higher quality than the two \"best\" from my outing. So be it; this is the gear I have. I'm scrimping for a nifty fifty but even it will be scraping the bottom of the barrel because I don't have the cash to drop on a $5,000 camera or a $200 piece of glass. End of Day, ISO3200 is going to be noisy on this camera, but it's what I've got to work with.  My SL1 is not a state of the art rig anymore and I know it. In this, I recognize that my gear is handcuffing me. Have to think the folks who came up with the EOS100 never figured some flatbilly from Tennessee would be trying to take a picture of something 150 Light-Years away from the sensor. So...kinda have to live with the fact that my gear isn't set up for this, and the budget isn't going to be capable of fixing that. This aint the rig for a pixel-peeper, not by a long shot. \n\nFourth, it's fun. More than I expected. It's much like fishing and I love fishing; when I push down the button and wait for the two-second delay (I used 2S to minimize shake) I'm casting the lure and asking a question; do I get something good, or nothing? Is there something here for me on this cast? Each press of the shutter is me asking a question and I'll admit it's a thrill to get an answer that, on the screen, is sort of what I expected. Very gratifying to get it on the desktop monitor in fully noisy-garbled glory. \n\nFifth, I've been doing myself a disservice not shooting raw. I've been toying with the idea of shooting raw for a while and I should have been doing it since day one, minute one. So much more power and control. My best bird to date would look soooo much better if I'd shot it raw and had the control over it. It's a hassle and my dino-saur junky computer struggles through the process, but man, so much control. To those who think \"Well, it doesn't matter, I'm just going to output as a JPG with an 800x600 size anyways, why go to the trouble?\" you're wrong. So much control over so many aspects. Tons of control, tons of options. While raw control matters more in images like the Astro ones, I can now see that it is a powerful tool I shouldn't have waited this long to learn and use. \n\nSixth, I'm gonna get some bug spray. The big jug. Like I said, I think one pulled a knife on me, or was drilling for blood from a deeper source. \n\nSeventh, a few basic parameters helps; Learning from u/junon that I'm just going to have to crank the ISO and live with the noise, it's helpful. To know that it's a long exposure at high ISO, shooting wide open, it's good to have a basic starting point. I did start playing with the settings a bit, but it's always nice to have a starting point of reference to go off of. Some have this instinctively, and for daylight images I do, but for this kind of shooting I was in the weeds and out of my element. I've done a very small amount of shooting where I'm dialing in a \"kill me with noise, daddy\" ISO and running with it. \n\nEighth and finally, I can improve. Not only am I relearning the basics in terms of how to photograph a unique subject, I'm also learning the basics of how to edit raw, how to clean massive noise, how to work with raw images. RawTherapee is a powerful tool and it's on me learn how to make it work for me to the max. Astrophotography is new for me, and it's on me to learn how to do it well within my constraints. \n\nBut it is doable. It is possible. I'd just about bet most everyone reading this might have a camera that could give it a stab. It's not a \"Oh, I must have a 1DX or better, gotta have at least a Hasselblad X1D II to have any success. All beneath that is futile.\" Nah. SL1 Reb with the lousiest kit lens that I refer to lovingly as my \"sh\\*\\*ty kitty\" lens, and go do it. \n\nThe future holds many things of great depth, and I'm lucky to have started with such lousy results; I can only improve!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/gtwa9t/my_first_stab_at_astro/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "my first stab at astro. /!/ (i apologize in advance for the length. little bit excited right now.) \n\ni know y'all don't know me very well, but i'm a daytime shooter. i've shot thousands of bird images, some of which i am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. thanks to the efforts of a member of this sr ( u/junon ) i figured i ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\ni can say that in 10 years of active photography, i've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than i was from 1:00am to 1:30am, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. wow. whole new game, nothing i'm accustomed to, nothing i'm used to. felt zero comfort. oh, and i need to file a police report; one of the bugs i encountered while out, i think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. yipes.  \n\nbefore i drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; i did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. i went to a -----> spot !!!  in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. i live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. so, i knew going in that i wasn't going to be getting an enormous fov horizon to horizon. this aint montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. a \"is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7a5d4nm](https://imgur.com/a/7a5d4nm) \n\nwow. that's the freakin' milky way...well, the edge of it anyways. having dl'ed stellarium and also made use of the web version, i'm a bit smarter about it all, and i can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the milky way with guest appearances by kaus australis and other cast members of the [sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nso, what did i learn? \n\nfirst...it's super not useful to try to use the viewfinder. i'm a traditional \"hold it up to your face like a noob\" shooter. it's the method i've used for all prior photography efforts and thousands of bird pictures. so, to be robbed of that tool is frustrating to a high degree. you're essentially working blind. i found a semi-workable method. pull focus on a bright star through the view if you can (made difficult by the screen being right below your eye glaring for you), then go on the screen and just be careful not to touch the zoom or focus ring. af was 100% unsupportive of my efforts, so i used manual. with so little light, the camera was basically warning me \"hey, stupid head, i'm not going to take an image of the inside of the lens cap. you'll not make me look bad at what i do best. no thank you. add light or i won't participate.\"\n\nsecond, there are few feelings as helpless as waiting on a 30 second exposure when you don't even know what the framing is like. it's legitimately like being ten feet underground on the screen because you're working blind. first couple shots, if i'd gotten an image of a jackson pollock painting i wouldn't have been surprised. you're working blind and that makes a 30 second exposure seem like a weekend waiting to see what each shot is going to turn out like. \"did i bump the tripod and accidentally point it right at this towering oak tree? am i framed? did i bork a setting? all good? hello? anybody in there???\"   \n\nthird, i need better glass...probably a better camera to put behind it too. at iso3200 i was getting pretty substantial noise, but it's a start. this is a (sh\\*\\*ty) kit lens, and for about 99% of what the average person (and myself) would do with this camera, it's sufficient. for astro...i admit i'm trying to punch well above my weight class. it's a small sensor behind a cheapo lens. it has limits, obviously. i'm fairly sure there are cell phone cameras that could output higher quality than the two \"best\" from my outing. so be it; this is the gear i have. i'm scrimping for a nifty fifty but even it will be scraping the bottom of the barrel because i don't have the cash to drop on a $5,000 camera or a $200 piece of glass. end of day, iso3200 is going to be noisy on this camera, but it's what i've got to work with.  my sl1 is not a state of the art rig anymore and i know it. in this, i recognize that my gear is handcuffing me. have to think the folks who came up with the eos100 never figured some flatbilly from tennessee would be trying to take a picture of something 150 light-years away from the sensor. so...kinda have to live with the fact that my gear isn't set up for this, and the budget isn't going to be capable of fixing that. this aint the rig for a pixel-peeper, not by a long shot. \n\nfourth, it's fun. more than i expected. it's much like fishing and i love fishing; when i push down the button and wait for the two-second delay (i used 2s to minimize shake) i'm casting the lure and asking a question; do i get something good, or nothing?

TL/DR at the bottom for those not wanting to wade through the fiasco.\n\nQuick backstory. I have a full time day job where I shoot video and stills for a company. I shoot fine art, fashion, editorial images outside of that job as a hobby. This was one of my for-fun, hobby shoots. At the end of the day, I'm more passionate about my hobby work as it's a much purer form of self-expression than my day job. \n\nOnward. \n\nI reached out to a contact that I've worked with previously on a commercial shoot, asking if she'd like to work together soon. Got a reply back right away with her being super stoked, said she'd been meaning to reach out to me and then sent along a bunch of creative inspirational images to get our gears turning. Included in those shots were some stunning fine art, abstract nude poses in nature, on rocks, in the woods, etc. We're fortunate to live in Sonoma County, so access to redwoods and big coastal rock formations is here at our finger tips. \n\nWe set our shoot date, continued to plan out the details and this last Sunday we both drove out to the coast and shot together for over four hours. Oh boy, we both pushed ourselves creatively too, working in the rain, cold, bugs, wet gear, soggy clothing, slippery rocks, hiking - all while really observing the landscape and features seeing how we could work her poses into what mother nature presented. I'm sure that sounds cheesy, but our creative wave lengths were in sync the entire time. She was often the one pulling the shots too, with my being there to make her vision to come to life. \n\nSunset came and went, blue hour set in and we headed back to our cars and the day was over. It was one of those shoots were you felt exhausted by the work and also completely energized by how smoothly it all went. There's so much less negative struggle involved when you find compatible, creative people that just get it and are helping to drive a shoot forward. \n\nThe images are stunning and I was STOKED to share. This is some of my best work, and I've been shooting people/models for about 15-years. Nothing about this shoot felt cheap, no shortcuts were taken and my hope was that these images would inspire future work by attracting other like-minded people to want to work with me. Hopes were REALLY high at this point. \n\nThis morning I fired off the gallery link to the model and got a reply back a few hours later. She explained how she loved the images, showed them to her partner who then went on a big rant about how he wasn't comfortable with the world seeing her nude, even censored. They got into a huge fight, and in the end she buckled to his fears to save the peace and agreed that they'd never see the light of day. \n\nGuess it's been a rough couple of days for her since the shoot, and it's not my place to say how two people should be together in a relationship. While on our shoot we were both chatting about how great it was to have supportive partners that each give us the trust to express ourselves creatively, but she said this shoot took him past some breaking point. From what I gather, they're already going through a rocky period and this shoot just really upset the apple cart. By the end of our chat, it was clear he has a lot of growing to do (in her own words). It was less about the images themselves and more to do with spending the day nude, with another man, with his viewpoint being that it's simply impossible that the experience wasn't somehow sexual and that the images won't be interpreted as being sexual. If he were to stumble onto these images, it would \"hit a sore spot\" so it's better to not post them at all.\n\nObviously I can't share the images, but if you look at [David Hanagan's IG feed](https://www.instagram.com/davidhanagan/), you can get a sense of what we shot, but with less of that faded IG look and even more dramatic surroundings. \n\nSome of the shots were with her in bodysuit and many had all her private areas completely hidden with the pose and/or with the landscape. Honestly, she has more revealing photos of herself in bikinis \"out on the lake\" or while hiking on her feed. Again, not the images but more to do with his insecurities. I feel like this shoot put the two of them at a pretty big crossroads, and that they were already headed in that direction anyway... \n\nSo what could I have done differently? Ah, some of you are probably already foaming at the mouth wanting to type, \"So idiot, this is why you have had her sign a release.\" I hear ya, but I'm not the kind of person that would leverage a release or contract over another person's head in this type of circumstance. Doing that would be a total dick move, it would make her situation worse and I'd ruin a few connected friendships in the process. \n\nIn the end she rightfully has taken complete responsibility for how this all turned out. She completely misjudged how her partner would react and in the end that relationship is more important than the images and my time. I get that. Could she have offered some money to make up for my time? Sure! However she didn't offer and through our LONG ass chats, it's clear she's going through some shit right now and I'm not really in need of any extra cash. Again, we've got some close mutual friends and keeping the peace is my #1 priority at this point. \n\nShe's now offering to let me use some of the images on my website, un-credited, so there's a small win.  \n\nAnyone else experience anything like this? Feels good to get this out in writing. \n\nTL/DR - Model sets up a shoot, comes up with the idea for a nude-based \"forms in nature\" style shoot, Images turn out GREAT, I'm beyond stoked, can't wait to share.

ah, some of you are probably already foaming at the mouth wanting to type, \"so idiot, this is why you have had her sign a release.\" i hear ya, but i'm not the kind of person that would leverage a release or contract over another person's head in this type of circumstance. doing that would be a total dick move, it would make her situation worse and i'd ruin a few connected friendships in the process. \n\nin the end she rightfully has taken complete responsibility for how this all turned out. she completely misjudged how her partner would react and in the end that relationship is more important than the images and my time. i get that. could she have offered some money to make up for my time? sure! however she didn't offer and through our long ass chats, it's clear she's going through some shit right now and i'm not really in need of any extra cash. again, we've got some close mutual friends and keeping the peace is my #1 priority at this point. \n\nshe's now offering to let me use some of the images on my website, un-credited, so there's a small win.  \n\nanyone else experience anything like this? feels good to get this out in writing. \n\ntl/dr - model sets up a shoot, comes up with the idea for a nude-based \"forms in nature\" style shoot, images turn out great, i'm beyond stoked, can't wait to share. model loves them, causes big issues with sig-other, now i can't use the images on ig because he's an immature man-child who can't see nudity as being non-sexual. if you think i should have used a contract, please read the full story.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 85227, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 83121, "autor": "jrbphotography", "date": 1607702214000, "content": "Zone Focusing + Spot Metering /!/ Hello all!\n\nQuick question.

It is free for anyone to use and is available for all major OSs.\n\n**Why darktable ?**\n\nThe answer could be different for many, but simply put, free or otherwise it a feature rich RAW editor that can be better than some of the commercial software out there.\n\n**Is this a replacement for my current editor (insert Lightroom / DXO, C1 etc..,) ?**\n\nNo, this is not a replacement and you will mostly be disappointed if you want to replace them. Because darktable does not behave like any of these tools. It has its own workflow and quirks.\n\n**Whom is darktable for ?**\n\nAnyone who wants to play around and take advantage of a RAW editor that is both versatile and free. It has a bit of a learning curve but with the current situation, I hope people might have some time to play around.\n\n**What features are there in darktable ?**\n\nIt is a full fledged RAW editor supporting almost all major manufactures (CR3 not supported). You can not only develop your images with global adjustments but you can make local adjustments using masks, stacking modules that act as layers, use pixel level tools like liquify and spot and more importantly, you can convert to a fully opensource workflow by using it with GIMP.\n\n**I have tried darktable in the past and it was either cumbersome or results were poor**\n\nWith 3.0.1 there have been big changes in both UI and processing that makes it easier to get your desired results with tools like filmic rgb, which gives you almost a camera jpg look with almost no changes/sliders.\n\nLet me show a quick compare with Capture NX-D which arguably provides best Nikon colors:\nHere is the [RAW!] (https://we.tl/t-GOLtQut9Si) file \nIt is poorly under-exposed and Capture NX-D does a very good job in bringing out colors. But a bit too contrasty.\nhttps://imgur.com/823Rpyc\nCompare this with darktable with no changes to sliders but for exposure and enabling filmic rgb\nhttps://imgur.com/wJKx72V\nSurprisingly, the reds look lot better and crisper with details in darktable. While greens appear muted, you can always bump them without penalty with masks in darktable. Something you cannot do in CNX-D\nFor comparison, here is one with Lightroom. (not my edit)\nhttps://imgur.com/FfINrYg\nWhile the colors appear a tad saturated with Lightroom the details are not better than darktable.\n\nSo naturally the question here is why use darktable if the colors are more or less the same.
