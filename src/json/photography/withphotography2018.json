I like to write short useful articles and I just came up with this one. This may all sound quite basic but I feel like I need to point this out because I see so much of the same stuff online. I want to encourage people to be creative, even if it\u2019s just for the sake of trying something new or different. \n\nThis article is both for beginners and advanced landscape photographers. I figured I\u2019d list some tips to hopefully give you some inspiration and give you some new options to try out in your landscape photography. With the era of social media I notice a lot of people just copy photos they see on Facebook or Instagram. This happens to me a lot. I always try to be creative and find \u2018new\u2019 angles myself. For some people getting creative comes naturally, but others will need a bit of a push. This article will hopefully help :) Here are 10 tips that will hopefully be helpful to get that bit of extra in your shots.\n\n1) Most landscape photos are shot with wide lenses. I love wide lenses myself, but try a telezoom once and experiment with long focal lengths of 100-300+. Try photographing patterns or small details in landscapes. Or try it in the mountains on mountain tops. Once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll notice a whole new world of landscape photography opens. Seriously, try it.\n\n[Green Hills close up at 300mm](https://i.imgur.com/Tsjk3v5.jpg)\n\n2) Play with motion. Clouds move, water moves. Try to create dynamics in your frame by the use of moving water or clouds. You can do this by using long or short shutter speeds. You can make use of filters to create longer exposures, or create drama with very short exposures. Always experiment with different lengths of exposure with both clouds and water.\n\n[Short exposure to capture drama](https://i.imgur.com/cNqqXYl.jpg)\n\n[Long exposure of the same scene with a different composition to create a totally different mood](https://i.imgur.com/yOh6pLL.jpg)\n\n3) Experiment with a CPL filter. I have done landscape photography without a CPL filter for years. But once you have one, you start to see why it can be so useful in different cases. It can be especially useful to control the amount of sunlight and reflection on reflective surfaces. You simply can\u2019t do this in post production.\n\n[Example of Rotating CPL effect on reflective surface](https://media.giphy.com/media/1o1u6VbxA54uBMCMlc/giphy.gif)\n\n4) When photographing with longer lenses use layers and compression. Landscapes look totally different with long lenses and you can compress foreground and background objects to give a lot of depth in your photo. \n\n[Compressed Road shot at 135mm](https://i.imgur.com/vrRBVGd.jpg)\n\n[Including a person with a long lens shot at 200mm](https://i.imgur.com/OZYvTbU.jpg)\n\n5) Use light to your advantage. Light always changes especially during sunsets and sunrises. Look for details here and isolated objects by light. This happens a lot in the mountains where clouds and light play around peaks go on during the whole day. \n\n[First Morning Light hitting a mountain peak](https://i.imgur.com/yI0maQn.jpg)\n\n6) When shooting with wide angles, get very close to objects to create a lot of depth in your photo. With \u2018very close\u2019 I mean VERY close. So close that your lens almost touches the foreground object. This can be a flower, a plant, or anything. You can use focus stacking to get everything in focus, or choose to pick a very wide open aperture to get the foreground completely out of focus/blurry. Both choices offer different looks and can both be used in nice ways.\n\n[Getting very low and close with Out of Focus foreground](https://i.imgur.com/xZQ3bLL.jpg)\n\n[Getting very low with focus stacking](https://i.imgur.com/cq7euyj.jpg)\n\n7) Make use of sunstars in your composition. When shooting directly in to the sun and closing down your aperture to f/16-f/22 you will see that your lens will create a sunstar. Different lenses have different characteristics. Some lenses create beautiful sunstars and you may want to make use of them. Position the sun against an edge, like the horizon or just an object in the frame. By positioning it slightly against an edge, the sunstars will look best. Try and experiment!\n\n[f/22 sunstar with the sun peaking just over the treeline](https://i.imgur.com/T3fxCrA.jpg)\n\n[Sun just touching the edge of an object to create a sunstar](https://i.imgur.com/tb42rPC.jpg)\n\n8) Learn how to shoot with extreme wide angle lenses and fisheye lenses. By extreme wide I mean wider than 14mm (full frame equivalent). Photographing at 10-12mm or wider with fisheye lenses give you a whole new perspective to a landscape. It opens up lots of (creative) possibilities. Learn the \u2018defish\u2019 technique also that makes it possible to create an undistorted shot out of a fisheye shot (not going to describe the technique here, but can be found online. I also have a Youtube tutorial about it). This can be extremely useful for photographing very wide landscapes.\n\n[Vertigo shot with 180 degree fisheye and corrupted with lens profile](https://i.imgur.com/TXya83Y.jpg)\n\n\n[Wide scene shot with 12mm fisheye 180 degrees, corrected so no distortion appears](https://i.imgur.com/Uzi8Pjr.jpg)\n\n9) Don\u2019t always immediately take your camera out and look for potential frames. Walk around in nature and use your eyes. Try to visualise how things would look through your camera. I also often use my smartphone, which has an around 20mm field of view. Simply to check framing.\n\n[random spot I found next to the road](https://i.imgur.com/yskqooz.jpg)\n\n10) Last, this may sound very obvious but it\u2019s important to train your eye nonstop. Look around you everywhere and try to see potential compositions in every day life. This may sounds hard and being a landscape photographer can be very tiring because of the nonstop possibilities nature offers. You train your eye by using a wide array of lenses so that you know how things will look through an extreme zoom lens, or how things would look with an extreme wide angle.\n\n[Cold Morning, Just looking around](https://i.imgur.com/DdeHidC.jpg)\n\n\nHope these were useful.

They commisioned me to work on several different shots for a range of nail polishes they are looking to market. Again, I was put in charge of coming up with the creative angle and had the freedom to explore and execute the final result. The client was open to any suggestions or ideas, and I had fun putting it all together.\n\nMy vision was to keep the design simple yet unique and deeply orientated towards the brand and product on show. Nail polish bottles are generally a small object and require slightly different treatment than, say, photographing a large carry bag. The bottle needed to be centered and close up enough to capture the logo and brand name. Each bottle was cubed-shaped, with a matt-pastel color, the same as the gel nail polish inside. The lids (bottle tops) were long, frosted-gold colored. This color really illuminates the final image and casts long diagonal lines as the viewer follows it up.\n\n## The Setup and Using Splashes\n\nAs this project is not a single image, but rather a series of images, I tried to create something that flows like a story. After brainstorming and running through different ideas, I found a particular genre of still life photography to be most suitable. Splash is the art of capturing liquid in motion. Splash is a classic genre, and it is popular to take splash templates and use them as backgrounds or additions to your image. It does require some knowledge of Photoshop and other editing software to manipulate. I chose to create a splash specifically for this project, and not take advantage of an existing one from other artists.\n\nI experimented with several different liquids, from organic to synthetic mixtures. The mixture or liquid needed the consistency and fluidity to fit the brand and idea. Eventually, I settled with a classic, white acrylic wall paint. A water-based solution worked best for this project. Pouring the liquid by hand from a raised position into a container below, I hoped to capture interesting patterns. The setup was a standard white background positioned not far behind the table. On the table, I had a container to catch the paint as I poured it from above. I repeated this pouring step multiple times until I found some splashes worth editing and merging with the nail polish bottles. The products were shot individually. This particular project required more post-production editing than usual. Software like Photoshop was used to achieve the final results.\n\n## To End\n\nThe client and I agree that the final results are satisfying. The elegance of the brand complements the creativity and flow of the photograph. The online community expressed an interest in learning more about splash. As well as, praising the final results. Furthermore, the client originally made me withhold the results until they have rolled out the new marketing material.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9ra645/still_life_photography_of_nail_polish_in/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "coming up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "still life photography of nail polish in whirlpool of splash /!/ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykeeci1lvto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykeeci1lvto)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n![img](ca7yap710cu11)\n\n## the brief\n\nfor this project, i was tasked with creating hero images for a cosmetic brand. they commisioned me to work on several different shots for a range of nail polishes they are looking to market. again, i was put in charge of -----> coming !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  the creative angle and had the freedom to explore and execute the final result. the client was open to any suggestions or ideas, and i had fun putting it all together.\n\nmy vision was to keep the design simple yet unique and deeply orientated towards the brand and product on show. nail polish bottles are generally a small object and require slightly different treatment than, say, photographing a large carry bag. the bottle needed to be centered and close up enough to capture the logo and brand name. each bottle was cubed-shaped, with a matt-pastel color, the same as the gel nail polish inside. the lids (bottle tops) were long, frosted-gold colored. this color really illuminates the final image and casts long diagonal lines as the viewer follows it up.\n\n## the setup and using splashes\n\nas this project is not a single image, but rather a series of images, i tried to create something that flows like a story. after brainstorming and running through different ideas, i found a particular genre of still life photography to be most suitable. splash is the art of capturing liquid in motion. splash is a classic genre, and it is popular to take splash templates and use them as backgrounds or additions to your image. it does require some knowledge of photoshop and other editing software to manipulate. i chose to create a splash specifically for this project, and not take advantage of an existing one from other artists.\n\ni experimented with several different liquids, from organic to synthetic mixtures. the mixture or liquid needed the consistency and fluidity to fit the brand and idea. eventually, i settled with a classic, white acrylic wall paint. a water-based solution worked best for this project. pouring the liquid by hand from a raised position into a container below, i hoped to capture interesting patterns. the setup was a standard white background positioned not far behind the table. on the table, i had a container to catch the paint as i poured it from above. i repeated this pouring step multiple times until i found some splashes worth editing and merging with the nail polish bottles. the products were shot individually. this particular project required more post-production editing than usual. software like photoshop was used to achieve the final results.\n\n## to end\n\nthe client and i agree that the final results are satisfying. the elegance of the brand complements the creativity and flow of the photograph. the online community expressed an interest in learning more about splash. as well as, praising the final results. furthermore, the client originally made me withhold the results until they have rolled out the new marketing material.\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 17171, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "idkwidd", "date": "2018-03-06 07:56:53", "content": "Looking for some stories of people who have lost interest in photography, and picking it back up again. /!/ Photography was my number 1 hobby all of last year and absolutely enjoyed going out and taking pictures, and learning to get better with my camera.

This is basically around how I organise and plan my on-location shoots so that I can work to a location\u2019s strengths and ensure a successful shoot, as well as some example locations that are publicly accessible around my hometown, Sydney. This advice isn't for large commercial teams or projects - those will usually need permits. But if you\u2019re shooting light for creative/portfolio development, this advice may be right up your alley.\n\n\nI have to be quite flexible with the location for my shoots. I select a location based on one or more of the following factors: Shoot Style, Time of Day &amp; Geographical Area.\n\n\n**Shoot Style**\n\nThe style of shoot can be your biggest factor when selecting a location. This can include shooting for swim, street, activewear, or simply knowing you have to shoot at a particular location by request. If you\u2019re lucky though, you have creative control to influence this in some way. For example, swimwear may look just as good at a garden, beach house or pool and doesn\u2019t require a beach in sight. The more creative you are with your locations, the more interesting and novel your shoots could be.\n\n\nRecognise the strengths of different location types and adjust your shoot to take advantage of them. Keep a shortlist of locations that have worked for you so you\u2019re not starting from scratch for every shoot, which can be hard. I save my locations on Google Maps so I can review them when looking at the area I might look to shoot in. This is a godsend for me.\n\n\n**Time of Day**\n\nThis to me is the factor with the biggest impact on the look of your photos. When you don\u2019t have time to scout locations (and I don\u2019t), you can instead rely on a couple of great tools: Google Maps and [Suncalc](http://suncalc.net/). Suncalc overlays itself on Google Maps and shows you the arc of the sun throughout any day. It will give you a pretty good idea of where the sun will be, and based on the type of location you can use this to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for your aesthetic.\n\n\nFor example, shooting a late afternoon session on an east-facing beach will probably see you plunged into darkness well before sunset as the buildings cast a shadow over the whole beach. Using suncalc can instead help you find locations that might be facing more towards the sun and therefore get you more time to shoot (I use Vaucluse a lot for late afternoon shoots). Personally my favourite times of day are during sunrise and sunset so that I can get more interesting natural light punching through the shot, but that's just my style. When it comes to shooting inland, streetview and community-submitted photos are also your friend because buildings and elevation can limit the type of light you\u2019ll have and viewing the street imagery will help you see what you\u2019re in for.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a case to be made about shooting indoors - if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a place offered. I\u2019ve done a number of shoots in apartments and used the furnishings and decorations to modify the light and create some really great scenes. \n\n\nIf I\u2019m shooting when the sun is high in the sky, I look for man-made structures that can give me more interesting backgrounds, but can also shield myself and the model from the sun - or even act as a reflector to provide more even light. Fortunately the more limited you are the more creative you have to be. If you're struggling to find structures to help you, instead adjust poses to make use of the light. Embrace the harsh lighting! Focus instead on the leading lines, the shadows and the overall mood of the day that you and your model have control of.\n\n\n**Geographical Area**\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to address the location types available to you. If you live on the coast, you may have access to heaps of great beaches. If you live inland, not so much - but perhaps you can find a lake, lagoon, or pool if you need water. If you live in mountains and pick your time of day appropriately, you\u2019ll get some stunning images. I am fortunate to live in Sydney and have access to some of the greatest beach locations, but you\u2019ll find a lot of my work is shot all over Sydney or parkland a few hours out. Sometimes I just shoot down an alley. Check out your local tennis/basketball courts and book a slot when it\u2019s not busy. Use the colours and lines to your advantage.\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think you\u2019re limited by only having access to public spaces for shoots. But then I remember how I wouldn\u2019t have come up with a lot of the lighting, backdrops and poses without being challenged in the first place. Think critically about your surroundings - what types of public spaces are there? What about alleyways, or interesting homes? Rooftops, backyards, even carparks can all allow you to be creative and produce something amazing. Locations that I\u2019ve struggled with the most have yielded some of my favourite photos due to the unusual angles, lighting and backdrops that resulted from it.\n\n\n\n**TLDR:** Use Google Maps and [Suncalc](http://suncalc.net/).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/7ptpdu/making_locations_work_for_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "making locations work for you /!/ i wrote this on my website a few months ago, and thought it might be worth reposting here if it helps some new starters in portrait photography. this is basically around how i organise and plan my on-location shoots so that i can work to a location\u2019s strengths and ensure a successful shoot, as well as some example locations that are publicly accessible around my hometown, sydney. this advice isn't for large commercial teams or projects - those will usually need permits. but if you\u2019re shooting light for creative/portfolio development, this advice may be right up your alley.\n\n\ni have to be quite flexible with the location for my shoots. i select a location based on one or more of the following factors: shoot style, time of day &amp; geographical area.\n\n\n**shoot style**\n\nthe style of shoot can be your biggest factor when selecting a location. this can include shooting for swim, street, activewear, or simply knowing you have to shoot at a particular location by request. if you\u2019re lucky though, you have creative control to influence this in some way. for example, swimwear may look just as good at a garden, beach house or pool and doesn\u2019t require a beach in sight. the more creative you are with your locations, the more interesting and novel your shoots could be.\n\n\nrecognise the strengths of different location types and adjust your shoot to take advantage of them. keep a shortlist of locations that have worked for you so you\u2019re not starting from scratch for every shoot, which can be hard. i save my locations on google maps so i can review them when looking at the area i might look to shoot in. this is a godsend for me.\n\n\n**time of day**\n\nthis to me is the factor with the biggest impact on the look of your photos. when you don\u2019t have time to scout locations (and i don\u2019t), you can instead rely on a couple of great tools: google maps and [suncalc](http://suncalc.net/). suncalc overlays itself on google maps and shows you the arc of the sun throughout any day. it will give you a pretty good idea of where the sun will be, and based on the type of location you can use this to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for your aesthetic.\n\n\nfor example, shooting a late afternoon session on an east-facing beach will probably see you plunged into darkness well before sunset as the buildings cast a shadow over the whole beach. using suncalc can instead help you find locations that might be facing more towards the sun and therefore get you more time to shoot (i use vaucluse a lot for late afternoon shoots). personally my favourite times of day are during sunrise and sunset so that i can get more interesting natural light punching through the shot, but that's just my style. when it comes to shooting inland, streetview and community-submitted photos are also your friend because buildings and elevation can limit the type of light you\u2019ll have and viewing the street imagery will help you see what you\u2019re in for.\n\n\nthere\u2019s also a case to be made about shooting indoors - if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a place offered. i\u2019ve done a number of shoots in apartments and used the furnishings and decorations to modify the light and create some really great scenes. \n\n\nif i\u2019m shooting when the sun is high in the sky, i look for man-made structures that can give me more interesting backgrounds, but can also shield myself and the model from the sun - or even act as a reflector to provide more even light. fortunately the more limited you are the more creative you have to be. if you're struggling to find structures to help you, instead adjust poses to make use of the light. embrace the harsh lighting!

Yes, film isn't just for old fogies and nostalgists. Lots of people enjoy snapping shots with a modern-day instant camera, as the compact and lightweight gadget hook up easily to your camera and deliver results that almost match digital in their immediacy.\n\nFrom selfies to Sunday brunch, there's always a reason to celebrate with these instant film cameras and printers.\n\n**\u270eInstant Camera**\n\n**Polaroid Snap Instant Digital Camera**\n\nPolaroid has filed for bankruptcy and sold off its name to a holding company, which also went bankrupt long ago. In 2017, the brand and intellectual property of the Polaroid corporation were acquired by the largest shareholder of the Impossible Project, which had originally started out by producing new instant films for Polaroid cameras and was renamed Polaroid Originals in September 2017. Thus, Polaroid's masterpiece, the instant camera, is still with us.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cqs2j1lycsi11.png\n\nThis is the camera that make instantaneous printouts to hold, clip and paste. This conveniently compact camera fits in your pocket and requires no messy inks or expensive toners. Users don't need to fiddle with a flash or focus the lens; just\u00a0look through the pop-up viewfinder and click and out pops an adorable 2\"x 3\"sticky-backed picture ready to share with friends and family. Zink Zero Ink technology also helps save you a ton of money while keeping your memories alive. The 10-megapixel sensor captures millions of colors and tons of detail, while unique picture modes offer a variety of tones and filters to suit your mood. You can even add a 32-GB microSD card to save shots for social media or additional printing. However, the photo quality is not as good as that of a decent phone camera.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n**Instax Square SQ6**\n\nThis is a square format as a new addition to the instax series of instant camera lineup, allows users to enjoy on-the-spot photo printing. It is equipped with various features: with auto exposure control, the camera detects the ambient brightness and adjusts to provide the optimum shutter speed and flash light intensity, even in low light conditions. Three color filters that fit over the flash in orange, purple and green are included to add a pop of color to the images. Additionally, the camera can be set to a selfie mode which automatically adjusts focus and brightness. There is also a self-shot mirror attached to the side of the lens allowing you to check the shooting range.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8xhlfjb0dsi11.png\n\nBesides, SQ6 offers three unique modes, you can press the Mode button on the back of the camera\u00a0which you can choose between: the double exposure mode allows two photos to be overlapped on a single film when the shutter button is pressed twice; the macro mode allows users to capture beautiful close-up images of subjects up to a minimum of 30cm and the landscape mode can be used to capture long-range impressive scenic photos.\n\n**LG PC389S**\n\nThe LG Pocket Photo PC389S Instant Camera comes with a built-in printer. It uses dye-sublimation printing technology to output vibrant, high-quality prints onto 2.5 x 3.7\" adhesive-backed paper in around 45 seconds. The PC389S shoots photos with pixel perfection as well.\u00a0Each image encapsulates five million pixels of crisp detail to give a clear image with a radiant and full color spectrum.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5qbrhhh1dsi11.png\n\nLG's Pocket Photo App, available for iOS and Android, allows for image corrections to be made in addition to adding custom filters, decorations, and frames to your final photos. Connect the phone to your camera via Bluetooth or USB, and you're ready to print out your favorite pictures.\n\n**\u270ePocket Photo Printer**\n\n**Fujifilm SP-2 Instax Share**\n\nIf you like the look of an old-school, tangible print but still want to keep shooting with your smartphone, the Fujifilm Instax Share SP-2 is the best instant printer available.\n\nAccording to Fujifilm, the new SP-2 is faster, quieter, has better image quality, and a greatly improved Wi-Fi connection over the SP-1. The SP-2 has also a completely new design, featuring a silver or gold body with a sleek white casing and an internal rechargeable battery.\u00a0\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/snevjpj2dsi11.png\n\nYou can easily connect your phone to the printer via Wi-Fi and share access to your library of images with the free Instax Share app, which you can then use to do some minor editing and add a filter or a custom border. Thanks to a new laser exposure system, the new SP-2 's high-resolution 320 dpi print will be ready in just 10 seconds. So not only does it print faster, the pictures are a lot better as well. As for image files, the printer supports JPEG and PNG formats.\n\n**HP Sprocket 100**\n\nThe HP Sprocket is tiny and has a tiny output as well: the paper tray holds just 10 sheets, and the machine can only produce wallet-size, 2 x 3\" photos. This is because it uses the zero-ink technology, which uses heat-activated paper instead of ink or dye sublimation. Zink doesn't produce the most detailed prints and some of the colors appeared washed out. However, the look of these filtered colors may appeal to you.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fzd59sq3dsi11.png\n\nFor a novelty printer, printing off social media photos has never been easier from your smartphone. Connect your social media accounts to the free-to-download HP Sprocket App and instantly turn those photos into colorful prints. You can customize your photos before you print with the HP Sprocket App to add fun text, borders, emojis, and more. Add a pop of personality for snapshots and stickers that are totally and uniquely you.\u00a0\n\nI liked the HP Sprocket's simplicity and fun design, even if it's tough to come up with practical reasons for having it around.\n\n**\u270eWireless Compact Photo Printer**\n\n**Canon SELPHY CP1300**\n\nWith SELPHY CP1300, Canon added another option to the battery-powered portable mini-printers market segment.
