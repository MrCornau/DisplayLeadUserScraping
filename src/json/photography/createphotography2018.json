My name is Simon Duvenage, and I am absolutely CRAZY about photography! Currently photography is only a hobby, but I hope one day I will be able to do it as a full-time or part-time job. I have been shooting on a Nikon Coolpix P500 bridge camera for the past couple of years, so I have been saving up to buy my first DSLR because I know that will be quite a big step up from my current setup, and I have no family or friends that have a DSLR that I could borrow. So anyways, a couple of weeks ago, as part of my birthday present my parents decided to help me buy a second hand Canon 800D (T7i for those in the US). So, unfortunately, it turns out it was a scam and the seller disappeared with all my money and never sent me my camera. So now I'm left with a burning passion for photography, and almost no money to finance it. I have tried creating a crowdfunding campaign, but I don't expect it to raise a lot of money (if any), and besides, it doesn't really feel right to just ask strangers to give me money for my hobby if they've never even met me in real life. \n\n\n**My actual question:** \n\nSo I have created this post to see if maybe anyone has some tips on how I could make some money with photography as a 16 year old without great equipment? I already have some experience using a DSLR and I fully understand how to use manual mode and have researched a ton of photography related stuff, like what different buttons do, composition tips, full frame vs crop sensors, etc. \nI know a good camera won't suddenly make me a better photographer, but it offers much more room to learn and grow into than my current setup. \n\nI will try to answer all questions you might have. \n\nYou can view some of my work so far [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/162018749@N02/)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9z20bj/possibilities_for_a_16_year_old_to_make_money/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i have tried creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "possibilities for a 16 year old to make money with photography? /!/ **some background info: ** \n\nhey guys. my name is simon duvenage, and i am absolutely crazy about photography! currently photography is only a hobby, but i hope one day i will be able to do it as a full-time or part-time job. i have been shooting on a nikon coolpix p500 bridge camera for the past couple of years, so i have been saving up to buy my first dslr because i know that will be quite a big step up from my current setup, and i have no family or friends that have a dslr that i could borrow. so anyways, a couple of weeks ago, as part of my birthday present my parents decided to help me buy a second hand canon 800d (t7i for those in the us). so, unfortunately, it turns out it was a scam and the seller disappeared with all my money and never sent me my camera. so now i'm left with a burning passion for photography, and almost no money to finance it. -----> i !!!  -----> have !!!  -----> tried !!!  -----> creating !!!  a crowdfunding campaign, but -----> i !!!  don't expect it to raise a lot of money (if any), and besides, it doesn't really feel right to just ask strangers to give me money for my hobby if they've never even met me in real life. \n\n\n**my actual question:** \n\nso i have created this post to see if maybe anyone has some tips on how i could make some money with photography as a 16 year old without great equipment? i already have some experience using a dslr and i fully understand how to use manual mode and have researched a ton of photography related stuff, like what different buttons do, composition tips, full frame vs crop sensors, etc. \ni know a good camera won't suddenly make me a better photographer, but it offers much more room to learn and grow into than my current setup. \n\ni will try to answer all questions you might have. \n\nyou can view some of my work so far [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/162018749@n02/)", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13682, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "skyline858", "date": "2018-12-10 21:29:28", "content": "Photo Merge (HDR, Panorama) missing from Lightroom CC? /!/ I'm looking to create a panoramic photo and it appears the Photo Merge option has been removed.

Felt inspired after just having spent a week in Lofoten. Still have to process lots of images but I did a lot of seascape shots so I figured I'd write up a little guide for Reddit on how to shoot seascapes.\n\n[Header](https://imgur.com/KzQsEwa)\n\nPhotographing the sea and the waves can be both challenging and fun. People often ask me what are \u2018the right settings\u2019 to shoot moving water so I decided to write a little guide on it. There are many options depending on what look you\u2019re going for. By using some examples of my own I\u2019ll explain how I shoot my seascapes.\n\nI usually define 3 options: Shooting the sea normally with a very fast shutter speed (not going to discuss it in this article as it\u2019s just pressing the shutter and not doing much else), shooting the sea with a bit of a slower shutter speed of around 0.5 - 2 seconds, and shooting the sea with a very long exposure to get that super silky smooth water.\n\n**Look &amp; Feel**\n\nNow I like to create some \u2018life\u2019 into my images. I like them dynamic so I often go with the shutter speed of around 1-2 seconds. Why? Because I still get that \u2018painting\u2019 look I love myself, but I still get the movement of the water. The flow that creates the dynamics in an image is very important. It can also be used for compositions. I don\u2019t like very short shutter speeds (except for rare occasions when the sea is very dramatic). Simply because the sea is often quite messy and with very short shutter speed it\u2019s hard to create that painty look I like. This is of course different for everyone, just stating my own style here. I sometimes love extremely long exposures too (30 seconds and up) to create that very smooth surface of water. When you\u2019re shooting with some objects in the foreground (like rocks for example) you can create that \u2018misty\u2019 look. \n\n[Rough sea at Tellera Italy with a 1.3 second exposure to capture the dynamics of the sea.](https://imgur.com/H3dN3t8)\n\n**Settings**\n\nAs mentioned above, for flowing waves and water I like to use a shutter speed of around 0.5-2 seconds depending on how fast the water is moving. I use Aperture priority with a closed down aperture of around f/14. I want a rather closed down aperture because I want a big focus plane. I want things in the foreground and background to be both in focus. I also used a closed down aperture because I want to create that longer shutter speed. Use the lowest ISO available on your camera. If you have bright light during the day you\u2019ll not be able to get a shutter speed of 0.5-2 seconds with just closing the aperture. You\u2019ll need some filters. When the weather gets dark and moody, you may just be able to shoot without a filter because there is less light. When you want a really long exposure during the day, you\u2019ll always need a ND (Neutral Density) filter.\n\n[4 minutes exposure during sunset with a 10 stop ND filter.](https://imgur.com/3Ia7wMH)\n\n\n**Filters**\n\nThere are a wide variety of filters available. To slow down the shutter speed you will have to use ND filters. During daytime I mostly use a 4 or 6 stop to slow down the shutter speed just enough to get that silky look. If you want to use a very long shutter speed, you\u2019ll need a 10 stop filter. The stops define how much light an ND filter will let through. The less light, the longer your shutter speed. Think of it as sunglasses with different strength. You can also use ND graduate filters. These only darken the top of the frame (the sky) so that you can balance out your exposure. The most commonly used ND graduate filter is the 3 stops (often called 0.9 grad) I often use an ND graduate filter together with a full ND filter (4-6 stops, or 10 for very long exposures). Another filters that is very useful for shooting water and the sea is the CPL filter. With the CPL filter you can control the reflections and glare on the water. Sometimes you get those nasty highlights on the water that you want to get rid of. That\u2019s where the CPL comes in. By turning it you can control the amount of reflection on the water.\n\n[Very long exposure (3 minutes) of a seascape in the Netherlands. Leading lines point straight to the middle of the wind direction.](https://imgur.com/LfkzTqg)\n\n[The same scene with a different white balance, toning and settings. Exposure time is only 1 second in this shot to still get those \u2018painty\u2019 waves but the image retains its dynamics and drama. I like both versions even though they are completely different. ](https://imgur.com/u2Y4XJl)\n\n\n\n**Timing**\n\nIf you\u2019re all set up with the right settings, it\u2019s time to shoot! When want to shoot moving waves timing is crucial. Waves come in and pull back, and hitting the shutter button at the right time is essential. Using a remote for this is recommended, as you don\u2019t want to be touching your camera when shooting longer exposures as your shot might get blurry from you touching the camera. I like to control timing myself, but another option is to shoot in burst/continuous mode on your camera. You can just keep shooting all the time and hope you get a nice wave in your shot. Downside of this is that you will get lots of files to go through later and also the timing is not super precise. \n\nNow let me explain you how I shoot waves action. I pick a composition and setup my camera settings. Depending on the scenery I wait for the right moment and press the shutter. The right moment is often when the water or sea pulls BACK. Not when it\u2019s incoming. When it pulls back you get that white foam pulling back into the sea creating beautiful leading lines in your image. When you have rocks in the foreground and you want water splashing over them, shoot when the water is incoming. But the trick is often to wait until the water pulls back and then press the shutter button. I keep doing this until I see an image on my display that I like. Then I move on to another composition. I try different shutter speeds from 0.5 - 2 seconds depending how rough the water is to see what looks best. Just experiment.\n\n[A wave pulling back during a 1.6 second exposure creating that pullback into the sea and the swirl around the piece of ice.](https://imgur.com/8j0SCyu)\n\n**Compositions**\n\n*some tips on compositions with water:*\n\n* Use flowing water as a leading line through the middle or corners. \n* Put your camera very low to the sea to get close up to the action. But be very careful for rogue waves that might hit your camera. Salt water onto your camera often means death.\n* When using very long exposures, use objects in the foreground to create depth in your shot\n* When you found your composition, try all kinds of shutter speeds. very short, 0.5-2 seconds, and 30 seconds. See what looks best.\n* Try to use objects like rocks in the foreground to use for splashing water, or flowing water around.\n* You can use waves on its own to create a photo out of completely nothing. Sometimes a single wave on it\u2019s own can look amazing, without anything else. Just keep shooting to try and catch that perfect wave.\nA wave pulling back in combination with swirling plants create a nice swirling leading line into the image. \n\n[A wave pulling back in combination with swirling plants create a nice swirling leading line into the image.

I can spend hours shooting the same location by just trying to get that perfect wave in my shot. Make sure you wear boots and waterproof pants if you\u2019re going to stand in the waves. Be careful on rough seas and beaches that are known for rogue waves. Also, be very careful that waves are not hitting your camera. Salt water is NOT good! There are cheap rain covers available for cameras that you can use to project your camera. I have seen many cameras die in the sea (and I have had one death myself). So be careful! \n\nHope this little guide was useful to get your started with seascapes!\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/7u0u9f/made_a_guide_on_how_to_photograph_seascapes/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i like to create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "made a guide on how to photograph seascapes /!/ hi guys :)\n\ni'm back with another guide. felt inspired after just having spent a week in lofoten. still have to process lots of images but i did a lot of seascape shots so i figured i'd write up a little guide for reddit on how to shoot seascapes.\n\n[header](https://imgur.com/kzqsewa)\n\nphotographing the sea and the waves can be both challenging and fun. people often ask me what are \u2018the right settings\u2019 to shoot moving water so i decided to write a little guide on it. there are many options depending on what look you\u2019re going for. by using some examples of my own i\u2019ll explain how i shoot my seascapes.\n\ni usually define 3 options: shooting the sea normally with a very fast shutter speed (not going to discuss it in this article as it\u2019s just pressing the shutter and not doing much else), shooting the sea with a bit of a slower shutter speed of around 0.5 - 2 seconds, and shooting the sea with a very long exposure to get that super silky smooth water.\n\n**look &amp; feel**\n\nnow -----> i !!!

there are cheap rain covers available for cameras that you can use to project your camera. i have seen many cameras die in the sea (and i have had one death myself). so be careful! \n\nhope this little guide was useful to get your started with seascapes!\n\n", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 18574, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "billium28", "date": "2018-04-12 04:07:49", "content": "Am I the only one that has login issues with Flickr?? /!/ I have had a solid 10 year issue of Flickr trouble where they either forget my PW or other log in issues.

What are the best Settings for Sunset Photography? What are Tips for Sunset Photography? In this Sunset Photography Tutorial I am going to give you my top 5 Tips for Sunset Photography!\n\n**1. Underexpose**\n\nShooting your Sunset Photo slightly Underexposed is probably the most important tip for Sunset Photography. Slightly Underexposing brings out more detail as well as color in the sky. Also do not forget, when shooting underexposed you can always increase the exposure in the post editing!\n\n**2.  Find the** **foreground** **first**\n\nYou do not want to be shooting the Sun as a direct Bulls eye! Find an Object that you can put in the foreground to create extra depth in your photograph. This is probably the most essential tip for Sunset Photography Composition\n\n**3. The Right Composition** \n\nDepending on how beautiful the sky is you have to decide how much of your composition should be the sky and how much should be the foreground. One basic rule is if the sky looks beautiful, have the upper two thirds of your composition as your sky, if the sky is boring, compose the shot so only the upper third makes up your sky.\n\n**4. Stay longer**\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential tips! After around 25 Minutes the Sunset actually starts to be even more beautiful most of the times! You do not want to miss this, so stay patient and even though the Sun perhaps has already crossed the Horizon Line you might still have the Opportunity for a great Photograph\n\n**5. Create silhouettes in the foreground.** \n\nFind an Object that has a lot of detail and that is recognizable. Then Underexpose so that the sky is properly exposed, but the foreground is underexposed. This will create an interesting looking Silhouette effect for your Photograph!\n\nI hope these 5 Tips are helping you for your Sunset Photography. I use these 5 tips and techniques for pretty much every single one of my Sunset shooting days! Though do not forget the most important Tip for Photography is to simply shoot a lot, so go out and shoot!\n\n***If you are interested in more Sunset Photography Tips, check out this Video below!***\n\n[Sunset Photography - How to shoot Sunsets (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGF3YAFAFE)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/8yk3y3/the_sunset_photography_shooting_guide/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "the sunset photography shooting guide! /!/ # 5 sunset photography tips\n\nhave you ever wondered how to get that perfect sunset shot? what are the best settings for sunset photography? what are tips for sunset photography? in this sunset photography tutorial i am going to give you my top 5 tips for sunset photography!\n\n**1. underexpose**\n\nshooting your sunset photo slightly underexposed is probably the most important tip for sunset photography. slightly underexposing brings out more detail as well as color in the sky. also do not forget, when shooting underexposed you can always increase the exposure in the post editing!\n\n**2.  find the** **foreground** **first**\n\nyou do not want to be shooting the sun as a direct bulls eye! find an object that you can put in the foreground to create extra depth in your photograph. this is probably the most essential tip for sunset photography composition\n\n**3. the right composition** \n\ndepending on how beautiful the sky is you have to decide how much of your composition should be the sky and how much should be the foreground. one basic rule is if the sky looks beautiful, have the upper two thirds of your composition as your sky, if the sky is boring, compose the shot so only the upper third makes up your sky.\n\n**4. stay longer**\n\nthis is probably one of the most essential tips! after around 25 minutes the sunset actually starts to be even more beautiful most of the times! you do not want to miss this, so stay patient and even though the sun perhaps has already crossed the horizon line you might still have the opportunity for a great photograph\n\n**5. -----> create !!!  silhouettes in the foreground.** \n\nfind an object that has a lot of detail and that is recognizable. then underexpose so that the sky is properly exposed, but the foreground is underexposed. this will create an interesting looking silhouette effect for your photograph!\n\ni hope these 5 tips are helping you for your sunset photography. i use these 5 tips and techniques for pretty much every single one of my sunset shooting days! though do not forget the most important tip for photography is to simply shoot a lot, so go out and shoot!\n\n***if you are interested in more sunset photography tips, check out this video below!***\n\n[sunset photography - how to shoot sunsets (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqgf3yafafe)", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30000, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Brunhilda100", "date": "2018-07-11 08:35:17", "content": "How can I create a slide show with the file name showing, without having to write a caption? /!/ I need to present about 2000 pictures 30 minutes after I take them.

Im talking to the millennial natural light only professional \u201cinstagram photographers\u201d here. /!/ On this fine Christmas as I finally feel free from being asked by fellow college students: \u201cHey man what camera should I get for christmas? My budget is...\u201d I would like to take the time to address all of my contemporaries.\n\nLEARN THE BASICS: Get a low cost camera and a prime lens and use it for a YEAR (I know its crazy, recommending to do something consistent to college students). If your first camera is a Sony A73 you will be a shitty photographer and will be down a few grand wondering why photography is not making you happy. Canon 5d classic + 50mm 1.8 would be a good start. You don\u2019t need all this new electronic jazz, start simple. The 5d classic is a legendary camera and can be acquired for less than $400. \n\nPeople compare cameras so often and spend much of their time trying to make a point of which camera is better and why. But photographers from the 30s like Ansel Adams used analog and took better pictures than 90% of the people arguing about which camera is best. Learn the history of photograph and understand how it has grown. Grasp the concept that people used to have to do things manually.\n\nFujifilm, Canon, Sony, Nikon, Leica, etc. all have a camera that has near superior function and use. Each brand is capable of taking a professional picture but this generation spends more time trying to figure out which camera is best out of the box with no skill and what other photographers think on youtube rather than simply picking up a camera and learning the basics of photography and lighting.\n\nSTOP FOCUSING ON FILTERS: \nLearn how to properly light a subject and stop telling yourself that your a natural light photographer. Cause really your about to drop way too much money on a camera you don\u2019t know how to use and not have any lighting equipment! Photography is the capturing of light! Lighting is important! \n\nOnce you learn how to properly use lighting. Try not to butcher it to make the picture look trendy. One way to check that you don\u2019t do this while editing is by using a nifty little thing called a Histogram! You can check your Blacks, shadows, mid-tones, highlights, and whites all in one place!  \n\nTRIPOD TRIPOD TRIPOD:\nHave you noticed that almost no college student uses a tripod and most professional photographers do? Believe it or not. You can take pictures for 1/125-30 seconds without them turning out blurry! Without a tripod you will not have access to &gt;1/125 shutter speed without the picture being blurry. Get a tripod\n\nNot all pictures have to be shared. And you don\u2019t need affirmation to enjoy photography. Create a portfolio for yourself that focuses completely on how to properly photograph a subject or landscape. Keeping in mind composition, lighting, and depth of field. This will help you from feeling the need to over edit a picture!\n\nPhotography is amazing and there is so much more than instagram affirmation and getting a following because of a trendy picture you took. Please take the time to learn! We have a endless source of teaching with the internet. And maybe one day you will be able to take better pictures than photographers from the 30s using analog :)\n\nLast note: Manual modes... check it out.

I basically spent 2000-2006 traveling and 2 computers died, 3 hard drives crapped out, I kept backing stuff up, I got a desktop and downloaded everything, then saved it all on the same drive, exported my iPhoto library on two drives then combined the two drives.\n\nSo.

After the very first post in 2016, I\u2019ve got a lot of suggestions from redditors and decided to complete another list [104 Photo Editing Tools You Should Know About](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/50613q/104_photo_editing_tools_you_should_know_about/).\n\nThen, Michael Zhang, Petapixel\u2019s Editor, asked me to repost this list on Petapixel. The article got 5,419 shares and tons of comments with a new portion of great tools for photo editing. The next list came with [148 photo editing tools](https://petapixel.com/2016/11/01/148-photo-editing-tools-apps/) Then, ten months after, I\u2019ve published a new list [186 photo editing tools and apps. The biggest list ever existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/72sg6a/186_photo_editing_tools_and_apps_the_biggest_list/).\n\nToday I\u2019m no longer with Photolemur (I\u2019ve left Photolemur a week ago). But I decided to continue doing this research. And the next steps will be putting all this software to the website with filters and user rating option. Actually, I\u2019ve already bought the domain :) [photo-index.com](http://www.photo-index.com)\n\nIf someone of you, redditors wants to help me with building the website - just send me a message.\n\n**What has changed in the new list:**\n\nSome of the apps had gone away from the market (you\u2019ll find them in the list). Also, during my new research, I\u2019ve found that there is almost 100 photo editing mobile apps on the market (in the previous list there were only 31 mobile apps). And I decided to create the separate list of photo editing mobile apps. It will be live very soon! So, there is no mobile apps section in this list. I\u2019ve got a lot of comments about including some kind of recommendations to the list. So, the first 5 to 10 items in each section are the best one (in my personal opinion).\n\nAs always, I want to say thank you, redditors!\n\nIn the beginning, there were only 61 photo tools, and I thought that it\u2019s a huge list!  :)\n\n**Now we have the list of 210 tools for photo editing and photo manipulation (excluding 97 mobile apps)!**\n\n* Enhancers (10)\n* Cross-platform image editors (5)\n* Online photo editors (16)\n* Paid Desktop Photo Editors (26)\n* Free Desktop Photo Editors (14)\n* RAW Processors (21)\n* HDR photo editors (15)\n* Photo viewers and managers (17)\n* Face Editing Software (9)\n* Image Enlargers &amp; Resizing Software (15) ^(new)\n* Photo Utilities, Plugins, Filters &amp; Effects (62)\n\n**Photo Enhancers**\n\n1.[Photolemur](https://photolemur.sjv.io/nLVm6) Fully automated photo enhancement solution to make all photos perfect.
