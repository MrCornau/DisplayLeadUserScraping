I apologize for that in advance;\n* This story is very recent (most recent development was 28th of January), relevant because of the sale of Olympus;\n* The camera grip was bought in Canada from Olympus Canada (in April of 2020);\n* The camera body was bought in the Netherlands from an independent camera store (late November 2019).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so here we go:\n\nThe story started in April of 2020, I was in Canada for a few months and I decided to buy an Olympus HLD-8G camera grip for my Olympus OM-D E-M5 II. I bought it directly from Olympus CA (online) and everything was great.\n\nRight up until about August of 2020, by then I was already back in my home country of the Netherlands, when I started noticing that every so often the camera would not stop focusing until I took the picture (it was like the shutter was always half-pressed). Usually after a restart or a reseat of the grip it would be solved. I found it weird but did not think too much of it at that point.\n\nFast forward about a month, maybe six weeks... \n\nI started having the problem more and more up to the point where I'd have it practically every other time I switched the camera on. I tried everything from different (Olympus) lenses, batteries, using the touch screen, not using it... Nothing seemed to fix it. I updated the camera's firmware, the lenses' firmware but nothing worked. \n\nThat's when I contacted Olympus US/CA, asking if I \\*have\\* to send it to CA where I bought it or if I could just have it serviced where I live. This was October 22nd 2020 (keep this date in mind). \n\nGiven the circumstances, I also contacted my local Olympus service centre to see if they would have an answer for me.\n\nThe next day I got a reply from my local Olympus rep asking me to clarify some points, I sent a pretty specific email back saying exactly what my problems were and what I'd tried up until that point to try and fix it. \n\nA couple days later I get a response from the same rep saying that since I bought it in Canada they would possibly not be covered by warranty (even though it's under INTL warranty) but to register it for repair via their online form in the My Olympus dashboard anyway, he said they'll keep me posted before it would mean I'd have to pay for anything. \n\nThe same day I sign it up for repair through the online form (specifying it as an under warranty repair). I sent it out with their shipping label probably about a week later.\n\nA couple days later: the first response from the US/CA service department (mind you, it's already been about 3 weeks since I've sent the first email) stating that I'd have to return it to the CA service centre to have it fixed under any type of warranty. I leave the US/CA contact for what it is and focus on the 'local' rep from this point on.\n\nA few days later I get the notification from Olympus stating that my product has arrived at the service centre (I sent it to a local address, but that was actually not where it went in the end... It ended up in Portugal, over 2000 KM away). \n\n4 Days later, I get the notification that they've tested my grip and that they did not find any defects, requesting that if I wanted my grip tested properly I'd have to also send my camera in with it. They did not tell me how to make sure both repairs would get linked. I asked, it didn't work. I registered my camera as a repair, specifically saying in the notes to link both ticket IDs so that it would end up in the same spot as my grip.\n\nBecause the repair registration process did not let me link the both together I also sent an email asking for the two to be linked. \n\nI sent out my camera in it's original packaging (just like I did with my grip) and got the notification it was received at the service centre a couple days later. \n\nNow: NOTHING for a week. THEN: a notification from the shipping company saying there's a package on it's way back from Olympus (note that I have not received any updates either my request to link both repairs or status-updates for my camera or grip).\n\nA day later: the package arrives, it's my camera body with a note that said they 'cleaned' it and that there was nothing else done. The box reeked of smoke when I got it back, but at least my camera was back.\n\nI sent another email to the same rep as the one I had contact with before saying that I'd gotten my camera back but have not had any other form of contact or updates since (reached out this time December 18th 2020).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTHING FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS: I reach out again asking for an update about my grip, also mentioning that I've been waiting a very long time already with apparently nothing having been done to fix my issues and that if it were to take longer still they'd probably just send me a new one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTHING FOR ANOTHER 2.5 WEEKS: I get a shipping notification a package from Olympus (Portugal) is arriving soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple days later, the package arrives, the original box in worse shape than when I sent it out, the plastic protection that was over the connector pins on the grip missing and the grip badly packed inside the box.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Till this day, I have not had any updates regarding my tickets/repairs since November 23rd!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to get this out there to show how horrible Olympus' service is (or has been to me at least) and if it gets enough attention, what they plan to do with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for the record: I LOVE MY OLYMPUS gear, it's amazing (if it works) and if I'd upgrade it would probably be an Olympus body as well, it's just that the service seems to just be absolutely horrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the ones interested, I'll also add the full contact log below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContact log Olympus:\n\n22 october 2020, first contact with Olympus about whether to send it to CA or keep it in NL, sending to US/CA contact (Me)\n\n23 october 2020, first answer from Olympus asking me what the question actually is (Olympus)\n\n23 october 2020, responding with elaborate explanation (Me)\n\n26 october 2020, response that the grip bought in CA has intl warranty meaning that I'd likely have to pay for the repair and to sign it up for repair anyway (Olympus)\n\n26 october 2020, I sign it up for repair via the website (specifying repair under warranty) (Me)\n\n12 november 2020, response from \\*FIRST CONTACT\\*(22 october), saying that I'll have to return it to the country of origin to have any type of warranty (Olympus US/CA)\n\n16 november 2020, product arrived at Olympus service centre (Olympus)\n\n20 november 2020, product tested, no defect found.

"autor": "Esthermont", "date": 1617182164000, "content": "[Discussion]Mirrorless+FF photography: I find no alternative to the Sony E mount system. /!/ I'm a first-time buyer into a mirrorless full-frame camera system for photography (no video) as a hobby in nature and some urban areas (forests, landscapes, streets). I value FF, intuitive ergonomics and accessibility (ease of use), light-weight, IBIS and good low light performance (for dark winters, dusk/dawn, fog etc.).\n\nI've been researching wildly but seems to have run into the fact that there seems to be no alternative to the Sony E mount IF you're buying into an entry-level system for semi-professional photography in terms of value.  \nI maintain this point solely because of the third-party lineup of lenses produced for the Sony E mount which seems light years ahead of it's competition. Specifically lenses from *Tamron, Sigma* and *Samyang* provides incredible versatility with quality that rivals some of the best lenses out there at often 1/3 of the price (looking at the *RF line* of lenses.... what am I supposed to do with those prices??).\n\n* R6 + RF 24-70mm 2.8 = 3800$ (USD)\n* Z6 + Nikkor z 24-70mm 2.8 = 3600$\n* S5 + Sigma 24-70mm 2.8 = 3200$\n* A7ii+Tamron 28-75mm RXD, 2.8 = 2600$\n\nI feel the potential difference in image quality between the above setups do not do justice to the fact that you can get another wide-angle- or telephoto zoom at f/2.8 (Sigma/Tamron) within the same budget for the a7iii system. The value in terms of versatility at an incredible picture quality just makes it a no-brainer for me. I\u2019ve been following Christopher Frost and Dustin Abbots reviews of these lenses and they all praise the Sigma/Tamron lines as simply amazing.\n\n**Am I missing something?** It's hard to believe that there's no real alternative in a competitive market economy if you're a first-time buyer into a photography system for FF/mirrorless. The a7iii is an older albeit still capable camera with frustrating EVF, screen, menus and ergonomics (I'm borrowing one).\n\nThere's three alternatives I've been considering:\n\n* Getting an FTZ 410$ for the Nikon and fit Tamrons/Sigmas on it but I don't feel this is ideal and it'll cost the same as a7iii+tamron. More horridly, I\u2019ll eventually face the gigantium cost of the premium Nikkor Z lenses eventually.\n* Another option is getting an z6+ 24-70mm f/4 = 2000$ and safe some money.

For the past few years I have done some streaming on twitch, and have always resented the crappy Logitech c922x I've had to stomach using.\n\nNow I am all-in on digital, and after doing some research the z6 ii seemed to be a great sweet spot of price, resolution, video capability and lens compatibility. I don't have any gear, and I understand we're not allowed to ask here so I'll leave it to you if you have suggestions for the basics that I guarantee I have forgotten.\n\n######I have questions\n\n1) Alright so obviously the EVF is the replacement to the optical viewfinder on SLRs. I tried to get my eye in there, but with my glasses it was sort of a non-starter. Are people using the EVF now, the LCD on the back or some external monitor? It's DIFFICULT to see inside the EVF! I am sort of disappointed! This is also very new for me, because I was used to focusing and getting live to-the-second results through the camera viewfinder previously. How do you guys do it?\n\n2) For general photography, what MP settings should I be using? Just because the camera offers 24 megapixels doesn't mean I should always use them, does it? For landscape I would imagine I want every last drop. For portraits, though?\n\n3) When swapping lenses, elements can get inside the camera such as dust, moisture, etc. What steps should/could I take to prevent that from happening in real-world situations? I did notice there is a clean sensor option... what does that do and will it ruin my device if I use it too much?\n\n4) Since I've never really had the capability to shoot RAW, I am unsure how to proceed. I do have an old licensed copy of Photoshop CS5 (from ages ago when I was doing some graphic design). Will it keep up with my current needs or should I upgrade to CC? (I have a nice PC.)\n\n5) Speaking of PCs, I do own a laptop and a 4k Wacom digital tablet as well as my tower PC. Could the laptop and tablet be used as external devices while I am shooting?\n\n6) What forums would you guys recommend? I understand this is more of a place for news and what not, but I am interested in talking. Discords, forums, anything helps!

But something about F-stops has always bothered me, and I couldn't find any article that explained it in a way that made sense to me.\n\nFor a long time I couldn't really understand how it was possible to make the aperture really small, and it wouldn't show up in the image. If the whole lens was being used to project the image on the sensor/film, then wouldn't closing off part of the lens also cut off part of the image?\n\nI stumbled on this [classroom exercise](https://spark.iop.org/pinhole-camera-and-lens-camera) and it made everything click, by comparing a lens to a collection of pinhole cameras. My mental idea of the process is more complicated now, but see if this makes sense to anyone else:\n\n* A lens is like a collection of a ton of pinholes\n* At each point on the lens, each \"pinhole\", sees light from *every part* of the scene is hitting that spot\n* If the lens wasn't there, and I had a bunch of pinholes, each one would throw an individual image. I could take dozens or hundreds of pictures of the same scene with an appropriate setup\n* The lens is collecting all that light, many many copies of the entire scene, and bends the light from each point (depending on the angle of entry) to overlap all those many images on top of each other\n* It's not a single image that's being brought in to focus. It's a bunch of in focus images that are being made to overlap each other, as exactly as possible\n\nThinking about it this way, makes me think about focus and depth of field a little differently:\n\n* A single pin hole doesn't need to be focused, everything's perfectly clear everywhere, at least as long as it's directly in front of the film. And there's a spot on the lens that will always produce a single perfect image of the entire scene\n* But the further the light rays move away from the center of the lens, the more they need to be bent back, and the harder it is to overlap everything so every spot lines up correctly.

So the night before, you get a proximity point, drive there, sleep, and then in the morning, you get coordinates of a photo point decided by the organization, and a 'road book' for the race. the problem is, the photo point is usually not very good. So you end up following the road book to find a good one. It's a lot of time on Google Earth and other apps! \n\n**You still scout what you can**   \nYou're hunting for spots that give you a long lens shot and a wide angle shot \u2013\u00a0of course, you've got two of flagship bodies, mounted w/ your two different lenses. Pretty standard stuff tho \u2013\u00a070 - 200s, 16-35s, 300s, 500s. You're also looking at the track \u2013\u00a0what is the terrain going to make the cars/bikes/trucks do? Turn? Jump? Brake? Accelerate?  Braking looks bad \u2013 accelerating throws up dust and rocks. Good - and great with backlight! Jumps are AWESOME. \n\n**It's only a job, so you stay safe**  \nFast cars are SUPER dangerous. You've got to predict where they are going to behave, and know where to stand. Hint: outside corner of a sharp turn after a long straight is BAD. I believe Marcelo has been 'touched' by vehicles before. [Or then there is this....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TANzFKqBcTI&amp;ab_channel=alwchre) \n\n**High shutter speed, aperture priority, autofocus**   \nAs one would assume. \n\n**You need to make the shots look different**   \nIn this case, the client is Red Bull, and there are a dozen vehicles to shoot. It's important to vary the angle, position, framing, action, etc, for variety.   \n\n\n**It's not just about the photo, it's the work to get the photo**  \nMarcelo says that photography is 50% or less of this job. It's being there, being safe, finding the spots, being rested, having your gear prepared, knowing a lot about the subject matter how the cars move/behave, getting the shot, delivering it on time w/ accurate metadata and info, and oh, yeah, the pictures have to be amazing. It's a lot of work to make things 'click'! \n\n**You get one split-second chance to get it right.**   \n...and after all that, the subject you're trying to shoot arrives at a unspecific time \u2013\u00a0you know the start order and when they left, but not how fast they're actually managing the track \u2013\u00a0and when they do show up, they are not stopping or slowing down.

Because I'm new, because I'm learning and just wanting to meet and greet as many people involved, I have posted all my best shots onto my Instagram and in my bio I offer all RAW images completely free to anyone who asks.

This is just a silly humorous post !!!  \n  \nI have been thinking: How to photograph people in their natural habitats, out there on the streets, public areas, parks, etc. Then it hit me, just think of them as any other animal. There are few methods to choose from, depending on the situation of course:\n  \n1. Stay unnoticed. If you find a suitable target, be as quiet as you can, be one with the surrounding and find a way to get as close as needed without alarming that person. If you find your hands shaking and being unable to handle the pressure, use a tripod (or monopod would be more faster in this case).  \n  \n2. If you find a perfect spot and framing, but you don't have a certain target yet in mind. Set up a camera on a tripod and use remote shooting when possible. You can look away or at your phone if you are using a remote app and act as if you were not even looking at them at all. People will eventually (after the cautiousness goes away) get used to you and just go on their lives. This will allow you to take shots of people stepping in and out of your frame.  \n  \nSome might even approach your lens and get too close, you can get some funny shots like that, but some might be a little aggressive so be cautious. Keep yourself and your gear safe!  \n  \nThese two methods both require great patience, but can reward you with great photographs! ...or a black eye.  \n  \n3. This is how I sometimes try to shoot birds with lens that can reach only maybe 80 mm. I sneak as close as I can, then dash towards the target with high-speed burst mode on. Only down side is that usually I fail to get the famous \"eye\" in frame with this method. Mostly end up seeing subjects from behind running away frome me.  \n  \n4. If you lack the patience or you are just lazy, you can try lure people with food, candy, or even with money.

And knowing when I need to use my camera and when I can just leave it home is a huge relief, especially if you are a perfectionist and obsess over your pictures. These are my cameras below, each with it's own purpose:\n\nI have 4.5 cameras (the .5 is my phone):\n\n1. Canon 5D MKii - This is what I use for my professional photography. I'm a landscape photographer and use this when I go on multiday treks. My landscape photos involve hiking quite deep into the forest in search of rivers and waterfalls, and having a DSLR helps me not stress about film and composition. I know what my shot will look like exactly and make adjustments to my composition while I'm there. Plus, I don't have to do any guesswork when the light is right. I only have one prime lens (Sigma 50mm f1.4). This forces me to stand in the perfect spot for the composition I want, and it makes it a super-patient hobby. [Here are some examples of what I achieve](https://www.tejaappilla.com/home/fluidity) with the Canon.\n2. Zorki 4K - oldschool Russian camera that I bought to learn about film photography. I had taken it to a few hikes before I purchased the Canon. It was not ideal for it. If I was in the river, I HAD to make sure water did not go into the nooks. It's also quite heavy and of course, being a mid-70s camera, it's hard to get the right accessories for it anymore. So the best option was to wear it as a sling, which made me feel like Indiana Jones, but it's a bloody pain in the arse. Also, I couldn't tell what my compositions would look like until I was back in civilisation and had the roll processed. That's when I made the move to the DSLR. Now, I do not use the Zorki at all. It's purpose is to sit on the shelf and look aesthetically gorgeous. It just serves as motivation for me... to use my DSLR.\n3. GoPro Hero4 - this I use for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWtu179KFdrq08tsFhSl8uA) where I just drive around my country, New Zealand. I don't use it for anything else.\n4. Fujifilm Instax SQ6 - this is just for my personal memories that I would like to look at years down the line. It adds a vintage feel to it and I quite like the time it takes for each capture (about 3 minutes until all the colour comes out). This is what I take with me when I travel as well, as I don't intend to take professional photography when I'm travelling (my photography is focused solely on New Zealand, so when I travel, it's me-time).\n\n4.5) Huawei P20 Pro - Although it's predominantly my phone, I purchased it for the Leica lens it features (one of the cheapest smartphones out there too at half the cost of Apple/Samsung). I use this camera for photos I upload on the YT channel's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/electrodrivesnz/?hl=en).\n\nEssentially, all these cameras have its own purpose. But the Canon is the one that is dearest to me.

It was next to Austin, TX. This was to capture landscapes and wildlife. I owned (and still have) a Nikon D3200, Sigma 18-35mm Art, Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary, a tripod, nodal rail for panoramas, L bracket, and a monopod. I rented the Canon R5, a 24-70mm RF, an 800mm f/11 RF, and a cable for the R5. In short, they were way more pleasing than the tools I owned.\n\n**Experience with landscapes.**\n\nTo get optimal results, I stayed away from apertures narrower than f/11 and avoided anything wider than the 35mm end. That 24-70mm lens does not handle 24mm well and it's possible to get everything in good focus even with f/11 (you may be surprised). I used autofocus then disabled it when using the tripod. No focusing issues.\n\nWhen using the HDR in RAW mode (I always shoot RAW), there was a bug in which the bracket images in RAW all had the same metadata. Ironically, when at the computer when I went home, it was obvious everything was spot on except the metadata within the RAW files.\n\nMy more detailed photos looked even more detailed when I used the nodal rail, rotating tripod head, following the angle marking, and shutter release cable. One of my favorite photos was a twilight panorama I made with fall colors. In Lightroom Classic, I adjusted the tone values for yellow and orange to make the fall colors easier to see. In PTGUI, used the TIFF files I exported from Lightroom for stitching the HDR panorama. I exported into an HDR format so I can tone map in easyHDR. I used Photoshop for cropping to the 1:2 and 2:3 aspect ratios.\n\n**Experience with birds**\n\nThe R5 and the 800mm f/11, it was way more pleasing to photograph the birds. The were far up and in the trees. With the Nikon D3200 and Sigma 150-600mm, I often used the 600mm end. It's my personal sweet spot and I still have to sneak up on the birds. The problem with the 600mm end is with a maximum aperture of f/6.3, the autofocus system was not always reliable even with proper settings and back button focus. It would sometimes fail to acquire focus at all. With the Canon R5, the autofocus was way more reliable even though the maximum aperture for the 800mm was f/11. No cropping was used for the bird photos because the size in the frame was just right. With the Nikon D3200, I had to do trial and error with the exposure settings by taking the photo, reviewing it, then adjusting. With the electronic viewfinder on the Canon R5, I could get a preview of the exposure *before* the shot to reduce trial and error. The photos were sharper than with the Nikon D3200 not only because the R5 is full frame and the better optical quality on the 800mm f/11 but also because of fewer focusing problems. The 800mm f/11 was also lighter weight than the Sigma 150-600mm contemporary for Nikon.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnce I save up my money, I may actually buy a Canon full frame mirrorless system and lenses that support it. With the Canon stuff being a rental, I had to send it back. The Canon full frame mirrorless was way more pleasing not just in detail capture but in operation too. It made me feel better about printing big with my landscape photos. This is to entice laymen viewing the large print to walk up to the photo to look at it in segments in addition to looking at the big picture. This is with and without the image stitching. Even with image stitching, I had no out of focus areas when I used f/11.

The only thing I have found about the sinks is not to use a solvent on them, I'm assuming because it will eat away at the PVC and damage the sinks.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what I would be able to safely use to get them clean and smooth again? I was thinking of trying to use vinegar since we use acetic acid with our stop bath for prints, so a diluted soak in vinegar would be safe in theory. Anyone have any suggestions to get it cleaned off? Thanks in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add, this is my first post here and I saw that the rules state that flair is only for portfolios, but it will not allow me to post without flair, I hope that isn't breaking rules.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/pjy95o/film_darkroom_sink_cleaning_question/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "film darkroom sink cleaning question /!/ so i work at a community college photo dept and i have an issue with our film processing sinks that i hope someone here can help with.\n\nwe have sebastian darkroom pvc sinks in our film processing room (we also have them in the darkroom for print making, but the issue is only in our film room) and i came across an issue. during the lockdowns, the custodians striped the floors and re-sealed/re-waxed them. now that i'm back to campus, i went to do the deep clean on the sinks (cleaning and then using car wax on them once dry). the issue is that in one of the sinks, i think the custodians poured the floor stripper or wax/sealer into the sink and didn't rinse it after so now there is a rough/hardened -----> spot !!!  where it dried on the sinks that i can't get off.\n\ni e-mailed the company, but haven't heard a response yet. the only thing i have found about the sinks is not to use a solvent on them, i'm assuming because it will eat away at the pvc and damage the sinks.\n\ndoes anyone have any idea what i would be able to safely use to get them clean and smooth again? i was thinking of trying to use vinegar since we use acetic acid with our stop bath for prints, so a diluted soak in vinegar would be safe in theory. anyone have any suggestions to get it cleaned off? thanks in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nto add, this is my first post here and i saw that the rules state that flair is only for portfolios, but it will not allow me to post without flair, i hope that isn't breaking rules.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 18880, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 128342, "autor": "NotSoToasted", "date": 1634927652000, "content": "Budget cameras and 800mm lenses? /!/ I'm looking for a good budget camera and 800mm lens to ask for as a gift for aviation photography.
