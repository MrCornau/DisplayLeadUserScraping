When taking photos myself, I was just a point and shoot kinda guy, not paying any attention whatsoever to subject, composition, light, etc.\n\nThis changed about 2 years ago, when I started to follow a few landscape photographers on youtube, and started to try to take photographs (landscape) more intentionally, trying to use what I learned from watching the videos. I never did anything artistic or even creative before in my life really, I was always a technical person.\n\nWhen I hear photographers talk about their photographs, they often mention feelings and vision, and stuff like this, which is very strange for my technical mind. I never have any vision, or feel anything (well, apart from enjoying myself) when I'm taking photos, I feel like my main motivation is that I just want to take nice pictures that look pretty. Boy, that sounds dumb. :D I can't even give a creative title to my photos, I see a lot of folks do that very well, but I can never come up with anything apart from literally descripting the image, so I never do that.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? Is it perhaps just a natural thing for a beginner in photography, or do you think some people are like this by nature, while other people are more artistic, in the sense that they feel the need to create, they have a drive to express themselves through their art?

The title is the best I could come up with at the time.\n\nI'm a landscape photographer and I've been doing photography for almost 4 years, and I still love it. I don't travel a huge amount (especially not lately) so I mostly take photographs of my local area and a bit of the coast. They're not grand epic landscapes but nice enough to practice with at least, but quite light dependent.\n\nOver time my style has changed quite rapidly, if you compare each 6 month intervals there's a noticeable difference. When I say style I'm not talking IG filters or the like, although processing obviously plays a bit part in it. But I also mean the sort of subjects I'm drawn to, compositions and lighting etc.\n\nOne main problem I feel like I'm facing right now is what I'd perhaps describe as inspiration overload. I like a lot of different photographers, and I like looking at a lot of different types of phorographs. And many of them all have their own unique look and style. I think you'd perhaps agree that photographers such as Ryan Dyar ([https://www.ryandyar.com/mountains](https://www.ryandyar.com/mountains)) has a different style to Albert Dros ([https://www.albertdros.com/world-landscapes](https://www.albertdros.com/world-landscapes)) who also has a different style to Neil Burnell ([https://www.neilburnell.com/gallery](https://www.neilburnell.com/gallery)). They're all great and to be honest I like them quite equally. I picked these 3 as just examples.\n\nBecause of this I feel like I'm a bit torn as to where I think my own photography is heading or where I want it to go. One moment I feel like I'm drawn to a more bright, colourful and dramatic look and other times I feel a bit more drawn to a kind of dark, moody and more subtle colour pallet. I guess this comes hand in hand with mood and whether I want to represent my own personality, or a world that I want to see. I don't know if this is normal or whether others have experienced something similar but it's where I am right now. In the 4 years I've been doing photography so far I don't think I've nailed a direction and feeling to my own photography, and that's why I feel a bit lost.\n\nI think this is made especially worse as I often find myself comparing my own images to others.

Experimental lenses/cameras/etc? /!/ So, I'm looking for lenses that have a very distinctive look. Would love to hear about what you all have come up with!\n\nI currently own a Lomography 64mm Achromat which [has a very interesting soft, but sharp sort of look at f4](https://i.imgur.com/7z0YrqWh.jpg) and has a very swirly bokeh at wide apertures. This one is surprising because I originally bought it as a \"fun\" lens expecting very little out of it. I've learned that (at f4 and smaller) it's more than good enough to be extremely useful even on professional shoots. \n\nI also have this 90m Wollensak lens that I attached to a sock to make a super cheap and innacurate, [but oddly good tilt-shift lens](https://imgur.com/a/ZfBooRs)\n\nNot a lens perse [but I bought a $200 Nikon D7000 and tore out the IR/UV filter from the sensor after shocking the everliving shit out of myself with the flash capacitor](https://i.imgur.com/y3S8LBsh.jpg)\n\nI've also seen this photographer (NOT MY CONTENT) that does absolutely incredible portraiture work with a Russian projector lens called a 16KP - it's absolutely amazing and has the most severe bokeh swirl I've ever seen with wickedly soft corners and a surprisingly sharp center: https://www.flickr.com/photos/116120663@N04/albums/72157677709262421/ \n\nAside from that, I've looked closely at Helios-44 for that classical swirly bokeh - the Laowa 24mm probe macro lens which looks super interesting as an ultrawide super-macro - Lomo Petzval 85 (which appears to perform a lot like my 64mm Achromat) - the Nikkor-s 50mm f1.1 which costs an absurd sum of money but has swirly bokeh with sharp details wide open - and mirror lenses which gives extremely harsh bubble bokeh.\n\nSo tell me about some interesting experimental lenses in your kit!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/qdzf7k/what_lenses_have_the_most_unique_visual_qualities/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "what lenses have the most unique visual qualities? experimental lenses/cameras/etc? /!/ so, i'm looking for lenses that have a very distinctive look. would love to hear about what you all have -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!! !\n\ni currently own a lomography 64mm achromat which [has a very interesting soft, but sharp sort of look at f4](https://i.imgur.com/7z0yrqwh.jpg) and has a very swirly bokeh at wide apertures. this one is surprising because i originally bought it as a \"fun\" lens expecting very little out of it. i've learned that (at f4 and smaller) it's more than good enough to be extremely useful even on professional shoots. \n\ni also have this 90m wollensak lens that i attached to a sock to make a super cheap and innacurate, [but oddly good tilt-shift lens](https://imgur.com/a/zfboors)\n\nnot a lens perse [but i bought a $200 nikon d7000 and tore out the ir/uv filter from the sensor after shocking the everliving shit out of myself with the flash capacitor](https://i.imgur.com/y3s8lbsh.jpg)\n\ni've also seen this photographer (not my content) that does absolutely incredible portraiture work with a russian projector lens called a 16kp - it's absolutely amazing and has the most severe bokeh swirl i've ever seen with wickedly soft corners and a surprisingly sharp center: https://www.flickr.com/photos/116120663@n04/albums/72157677709262421/ \n\naside from that, i've looked closely at helios-44 for that classical swirly bokeh - the laowa 24mm probe macro lens which looks super interesting as an ultrawide super-macro - lomo petzval 85 (which appears to perform a lot like my 64mm achromat) - the nikkor-s 50mm f1.1 which costs an absurd sum of money but has swirly bokeh with sharp details wide open - and mirror lenses which gives extremely harsh bubble bokeh.\n\nso tell me about some interesting experimental lenses in your kit!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 18136, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "djhin2", "date": "2021-01-15 17:50:07", "content": "Dealing with a fellow photographer who freeloads /!/ Hello! For context I am a hobbyist photographer who works with computer science for a career. I'm friendly with a professional photographer who's been shooting a little longer. I mostly do environmental portraits so I'm always trying to find creative ways to surround or enhance my model's profile.\n\nLately i've noticed that this other photographer has been following and shooting with people I work with, right after I put their shots up on social media. She also has been doing very similar themes to everything I try, right after i do them. It almost feels like she's letting me find new models + come up with ideas for her to poach.\n\nI do this for fun so my contracts literally only protect me from having to deal with people that ask for compensation, or extra photos, or fast turnarounds. I'm frustrated; I don't think what this photographer is doing is straight-up wrong, but its definitely annoying feeling like I have to look over my shoulder whenever I shoot.
