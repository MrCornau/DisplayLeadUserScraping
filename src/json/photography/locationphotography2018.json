I\u2019m back here with another straight forward guide on how to get something more out of your waterfall shots. The idea to this guide came to me when I recently visited Iceland again and kept seeing everyone taking the same shots at the famous waterfalls. Even the \u2018professional\u2019 photographers with very expensive gear were just planting their tripod in the ground, putting on a wide angle with an ND filter and were all taking the same shots. Granted, the waterfalls in Iceland are impressive and great to capture just like that, but you\u2019ll end up with a shot like everyone else. Here are a few tips on how to get something more out of these amazing waterfalls:\n\n* Try putting on a 70-200 (or more) to get up close and capture details. Stand far away from the waterfall so that everything looks compressed.\n[Close up of ice pillars combined with water](https://imgur.com/4z6A6ts)\n* Try going in even closer and capture ONLY the water flow. Use a very high shutter speed (around 1/300 or faster) and a higher ISO if you need. The power of falling water can look amazing just on its own. Try converting it to black &amp; white and increase contract. You will get some really \u2018artsy\u2019 results.\n[Black &amp; White shot with increased contrast of falling water](https://imgur.com/b5TtKVa)\t\n* Try framing close ups of the waterfall combined with things on the side to give a contrasty look with the white water and the grass/rocks or whatever there is on the side. It will always give a contrasty look with the white water.\n[white water with dark green moss](https://imgur.com/OVpNkA0)\t\n* Skies during the day are often boring. Frame the waterfall with a foreground and remove the sky out of the frame.\n[foreground texture with waterfall](https://imgur.com/CGtv61W)\t\n* Use a mid-range zoom (24-70) and take portions of the waterfall. Pay close attention to your composition.\n[framing only part of the waterfall](https://imgur.com/hxWInD4)\t\n* Use an extreme wide angle and pay close attention to your foreground. Foregrounds can be textures on the ground, or just a simple rock or patch of grass. Frame something interesting in the foreground and the waterfall in the background.\n[some simple stones and grass create a leading foreground](https://imgur.com/oBDbrqT)\t\n* Another trick to include a foreground is to get very low in the grass or some flowers. Use a fast prime (like a 50mm f2 - f/1.4) and focus on the waterfall. Blur out the foreground by using a fast aperture.

i\u2019m back here with another straight forward guide on how to get something more out of your waterfall shots. the idea to this guide came to me when i recently visited iceland again and kept seeing everyone taking the same shots at the famous waterfalls. even the \u2018professional\u2019 photographers with very expensive gear were just planting their tripod in the ground, putting on a wide angle with an nd filter and were all taking the same shots. granted, the waterfalls in iceland are impressive and great to capture just like that, but you\u2019ll end up with a shot like everyone else. here are a few tips on how to get something more out of these amazing waterfalls:\n\n* try putting on a 70-200 (or more) to get up close and capture details. stand far away from the waterfall so that everything looks compressed.\n[close up of ice pillars combined with water](https://imgur.com/4z6a6ts)\n* try going in even closer and capture only the water flow. use a very high shutter speed (around 1/300 or faster) and a higher iso if you need. the power of falling water can look amazing just on its own. try converting it to black &amp; white and increase contract. you will get some really \u2018artsy\u2019 results.\n[black &amp; white shot with increased contrast of falling water](https://imgur.com/b5ttkva)\t\n* try framing close ups of the waterfall combined with things on the side to give a contrasty look with the white water and the grass/rocks or whatever there is on the side. it will always give a contrasty look with the white water.\n[white water with dark green moss](https://imgur.com/ovpnka0)\t\n* skies during the day are often boring. frame the waterfall with a foreground and remove the sky out of the frame.\n[foreground texture with waterfall](https://imgur.com/cgtv61w)\t\n* use a mid-range zoom (24-70) and take portions of the waterfall. pay close attention to your composition.\n[framing only part of the waterfall](https://imgur.com/hxwind4)\t\n* use an extreme wide angle and pay close attention to your foreground. foregrounds can be textures on the ground, or just a simple rock or patch of grass. frame something interesting in the foreground and the waterfall in the background.\n[some simple stones and grass create a leading foreground](https://imgur.com/obdbrqt)\t\n* another trick to include a foreground is to get very low in the grass or some flowers. use a fast prime (like a 50mm f2 - f/1.4) and focus on the waterfall. blur out the foreground by using a fast aperture. this can create some cool effects.\n[blurred foreground with a fast lens](https://imgur.com/ritefqi)\t\n* scale often doesn\u2019t come across on photos . use people to show scale on big waterfalls.\n[show scale with people](https://imgur.com/ti3di2r)\t\n* nd filters are cool to smoothen water, but try working without them and really capture the power of the water. this can work specifically well with a dramatic sky. dramatic skies combined with the power of falling water gives you a dramatic result which has a greater impact on the viewer.\n[showing drama without nd filters and moody sky](https://imgur.com/xmanda6)\t\n* have patience and fun. i can spend a great amount of time thinking out of the box at waterfalls by either scouting around with an extreme wide angle for interesting foreground objects or simply taking a 100-400 lens and slowly moving my lens while looking through my viewfinder slowly checking around for every detail in the waterfall itself.\n\nall of these pictures (except the one with the blurred foreground) are taken at the same waterfall to show the diversity of shots you can take at a single -----> location !!!

I don't have much equipment, and I'm still using entry-level camera, my (by now old) Nikon d5200. I have a telezoom lens, a fish-eye lens and the standard lens, as well as a reflector disc for portraits. I shoot in raw-format, do finishing in lightroom and the occasional use of photoshop if needed.\n\nRecently I got an invitation to an old friend's wedding in the mail, and the wedding is in July. It will be held in a relatively countryside location. When asking more details about the wedding, she asked me if I would be interested in not just casually documenting their big day, but if I would take their wedding photographs as well. \n\nShe offered to pay, but I don't feel comfortable taking money for my work seeing as I'm just an amateur and this is an old friend. We were something like best friends in high school, before we went our separate ways for college. Of course, in my opinion, being asked to do this is a great honor. I'm happy that they think my photos are good enough that they would like me to document their big day. \n\nI'm thinking that the shoot, editing and print could be my wedding gift to them, since as a student my economy is pretty tight and I already have to spend $300 in transport to get there. \n\nHowever, it also makes me beyond nervous. I have photographed at a wedding once before, and that was just casual documentation when I was but an enthusiastic teenager without any experience.\n\nThe wedding is in less than two months.\n\nI won't have a chance to see the location for the wedding photos until the day before the ceremony. All I know is that it's in a summer garden. The session is planned to be done in 90 minutes between the actual ceremony and the wedding reception, so I won't have much leeway when it comes to time.\n\nI would take any advice right now on how to prepare, plan and perhaps even whether I should consider getting more equipment.

Felt inspired after just having spent a week in Lofoten. Still have to process lots of images but I did a lot of seascape shots so I figured I'd write up a little guide for Reddit on how to shoot seascapes.\n\n[Header](https://imgur.com/KzQsEwa)\n\nPhotographing the sea and the waves can be both challenging and fun. People often ask me what are \u2018the right settings\u2019 to shoot moving water so I decided to write a little guide on it. There are many options depending on what look you\u2019re going for. By using some examples of my own I\u2019ll explain how I shoot my seascapes.\n\nI usually define 3 options: Shooting the sea normally with a very fast shutter speed (not going to discuss it in this article as it\u2019s just pressing the shutter and not doing much else), shooting the sea with a bit of a slower shutter speed of around 0.5 - 2 seconds, and shooting the sea with a very long exposure to get that super silky smooth water.\n\n**Look &amp; Feel**\n\nNow I like to create some \u2018life\u2019 into my images. I like them dynamic so I often go with the shutter speed of around 1-2 seconds. Why? Because I still get that \u2018painting\u2019 look I love myself, but I still get the movement of the water. The flow that creates the dynamics in an image is very important. It can also be used for compositions. I don\u2019t like very short shutter speeds (except for rare occasions when the sea is very dramatic). Simply because the sea is often quite messy and with very short shutter speed it\u2019s hard to create that painty look I like. This is of course different for everyone, just stating my own style here. I sometimes love extremely long exposures too (30 seconds and up) to create that very smooth surface of water. When you\u2019re shooting with some objects in the foreground (like rocks for example) you can create that \u2018misty\u2019 look. \n\n[Rough sea at Tellera Italy with a 1.3 second exposure to capture the dynamics of the sea.](https://imgur.com/H3dN3t8)\n\n**Settings**\n\nAs mentioned above, for flowing waves and water I like to use a shutter speed of around 0.5-2 seconds depending on how fast the water is moving. I use Aperture priority with a closed down aperture of around f/14. I want a rather closed down aperture because I want a big focus plane. I want things in the foreground and background to be both in focus. I also used a closed down aperture because I want to create that longer shutter speed. Use the lowest ISO available on your camera. If you have bright light during the day you\u2019ll not be able to get a shutter speed of 0.5-2 seconds with just closing the aperture. You\u2019ll need some filters. When the weather gets dark and moody, you may just be able to shoot without a filter because there is less light. When you want a really long exposure during the day, you\u2019ll always need a ND (Neutral Density) filter.\n\n[4 minutes exposure during sunset with a 10 stop ND filter.](https://imgur.com/3Ia7wMH)\n\n\n**Filters**\n\nThere are a wide variety of filters available. To slow down the shutter speed you will have to use ND filters. During daytime I mostly use a 4 or 6 stop to slow down the shutter speed just enough to get that silky look. If you want to use a very long shutter speed, you\u2019ll need a 10 stop filter. The stops define how much light an ND filter will let through. The less light, the longer your shutter speed. Think of it as sunglasses with different strength. You can also use ND graduate filters. These only darken the top of the frame (the sky) so that you can balance out your exposure. The most commonly used ND graduate filter is the 3 stops (often called 0.9 grad) I often use an ND graduate filter together with a full ND filter (4-6 stops, or 10 for very long exposures). Another filters that is very useful for shooting water and the sea is the CPL filter. With the CPL filter you can control the reflections and glare on the water. Sometimes you get those nasty highlights on the water that you want to get rid of. That\u2019s where the CPL comes in. By turning it you can control the amount of reflection on the water.\n\n[Very long exposure (3 minutes) of a seascape in the Netherlands. Leading lines point straight to the middle of the wind direction.](https://imgur.com/LfkzTqg)\n\n[The same scene with a different white balance, toning and settings. Exposure time is only 1 second in this shot to still get those \u2018painty\u2019 waves but the image retains its dynamics and drama. I like both versions even though they are completely different. ](https://imgur.com/u2Y4XJl)\n\n\n\n**Timing**\n\nIf you\u2019re all set up with the right settings, it\u2019s time to shoot! When want to shoot moving waves timing is crucial. Waves come in and pull back, and hitting the shutter button at the right time is essential. Using a remote for this is recommended, as you don\u2019t want to be touching your camera when shooting longer exposures as your shot might get blurry from you touching the camera. I like to control timing myself, but another option is to shoot in burst/continuous mode on your camera. You can just keep shooting all the time and hope you get a nice wave in your shot. Downside of this is that you will get lots of files to go through later and also the timing is not super precise. \n\nNow let me explain you how I shoot waves action. I pick a composition and setup my camera settings. Depending on the scenery I wait for the right moment and press the shutter. The right moment is often when the water or sea pulls BACK. Not when it\u2019s incoming. When it pulls back you get that white foam pulling back into the sea creating beautiful leading lines in your image. When you have rocks in the foreground and you want water splashing over them, shoot when the water is incoming. But the trick is often to wait until the water pulls back and then press the shutter button. I keep doing this until I see an image on my display that I like. Then I move on to another composition. I try different shutter speeds from 0.5 - 2 seconds depending how rough the water is to see what looks best. Just experiment.\n\n[A wave pulling back during a 1.6 second exposure creating that pullback into the sea and the swirl around the piece of ice.](https://imgur.com/8j0SCyu)\n\n**Compositions**\n\n*some tips on compositions with water:*\n\n* Use flowing water as a leading line through the middle or corners. \n* Put your camera very low to the sea to get close up to the action. But be very careful for rogue waves that might hit your camera. Salt water onto your camera often means death.\n* When using very long exposures, use objects in the foreground to create depth in your shot\n* When you found your composition, try all kinds of shutter speeds. very short, 0.5-2 seconds, and 30 seconds. See what looks best.\n* Try to use objects like rocks in the foreground to use for splashing water, or flowing water around.\n* You can use waves on its own to create a photo out of completely nothing. Sometimes a single wave on it\u2019s own can look amazing, without anything else. Just keep shooting to try and catch that perfect wave.\nA wave pulling back in combination with swirling plants create a nice swirling leading line into the image. \n\n[A wave pulling back in combination with swirling plants create a nice swirling leading line into the image.

I can spend hours shooting the same location by just trying to get that perfect wave in my shot. Make sure you wear boots and waterproof pants if you\u2019re going to stand in the waves. Be careful on rough seas and beaches that are known for rogue waves. Also, be very careful that waves are not hitting your camera. Salt water is NOT good! There are cheap rain covers available for cameras that you can use to project your camera. I have seen many cameras die in the sea (and I have had one death myself).

"selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "made a guide on how to photograph seascapes /!/ hi guys :)\n\ni'm back with another guide. felt inspired after just having spent a week in lofoten. still have to process lots of images but i did a lot of seascape shots so i figured i'd write up a little guide for reddit on how to shoot seascapes.\n\n[header](https://imgur.com/kzqsewa)\n\nphotographing the sea and the waves can be both challenging and fun. people often ask me what are \u2018the right settings\u2019 to shoot moving water so i decided to write a little guide on it. there are many options depending on what look you\u2019re going for. by using some examples of my own i\u2019ll explain how i shoot my seascapes.\n\ni usually define 3 options: shooting the sea normally with a very fast shutter speed (not going to discuss it in this article as it\u2019s just pressing the shutter and not doing much else), shooting the sea with a bit of a slower shutter speed of around 0.5 - 2 seconds, and shooting the sea with a very long exposure to get that super silky smooth water.\n\n**look &amp; feel**\n\nnow i like to create some \u2018life\u2019 into my images. i like them dynamic so i often go with the shutter speed of around 1-2 seconds. why? because i still get that \u2018painting\u2019 look i love myself, but i still get the movement of the water. the flow that creates the dynamics in an image is very important. it can also be used for compositions. i don\u2019t like very short shutter speeds (except for rare occasions when the sea is very dramatic). simply because the sea is often quite messy and with very short shutter speed it\u2019s hard to create that painty look i like. this is of course different for everyone, just stating my own style here. i sometimes love extremely long exposures too (30 seconds and up) to create that very smooth surface of water. when you\u2019re shooting with some objects in the foreground (like rocks for example) you can create that \u2018misty\u2019 look. \n\n[rough sea at tellera italy with a 1.3 second exposure to capture the dynamics of the sea.](https://imgur.com/h3dn3t8)\n\n**settings**\n\nas mentioned above, for flowing waves and water i like to use a shutter speed of around 0.5-2 seconds depending on how fast the water is moving. i use aperture priority with a closed down aperture of around f/14. i want a rather closed down aperture because i want a big focus plane. i want things in the foreground and background to be both in focus. i also used a closed down aperture because i want to create that longer shutter speed. use the lowest iso available on your camera. if you have bright light during the day you\u2019ll not be able to get a shutter speed of 0.5-2 seconds with just closing the aperture. you\u2019ll need some filters. when the weather gets dark and moody, you may just be able to shoot without a filter because there is less light. when you want a really long exposure during the day, you\u2019ll always need a nd (neutral density) filter.\n\n[4 minutes exposure during sunset with a 10 stop nd filter.](https://imgur.com/3ia7wmh)\n\n\n**filters**\n\nthere are a wide variety of filters available. to slow down the shutter speed you will have to use nd filters. during daytime i mostly use a 4 or 6 stop to slow down the shutter speed just enough to get that silky look. if you want to use a very long shutter speed, you\u2019ll need a 10 stop filter. the stops define how much light an nd filter will let through. the less light, the longer your shutter speed. think of it as sunglasses with different strength. you can also use nd graduate filters. these only darken the top of the frame (the sky) so that you can balance out your exposure. the most commonly used nd graduate filter is the 3 stops (often called 0.9 grad) i often use an nd graduate filter together with a full nd filter (4-6 stops, or 10 for very long exposures). another filters that is very useful for shooting water and the sea is the cpl filter. with the cpl filter you can control the reflections and glare on the water. sometimes you get those nasty highlights on the water that you want to get rid of. that\u2019s where the cpl comes in. by turning it you can control the amount of reflection on the water.\n\n[very long exposure (3 minutes) of a seascape in the netherlands. leading lines point

get those \u2018painty\u2019 waves but the image retains its dynamics and drama. i like both versions even though they are completely different. ](https://imgur.com/u2y4xjl)\n\n\n\n**timing**\n\nif you\u2019re all set up with the right settings, it\u2019s time to shoot! when want to shoot moving waves timing is crucial. waves come in and pull back, and hitting the shutter button at the right time is essential. using a remote for this is recommended, as you don\u2019t want to be touching your camera when shooting longer exposures as your shot might get blurry from you touching the camera. i like to control timing myself, but another option is to shoot in burst/continuous mode on your camera. you can just keep shooting all the time and hope you get a nice wave in your shot. downside of this is that you will get lots of files to go through later and also the timing is not super precise. \n\nnow let me explain you how i shoot waves action. i pick a composition and setup my camera settings. depending on the scenery i wait for the right moment and press the shutter. the right moment is often when the water or sea pulls back. not when it\u2019s incoming. when it pulls back you get that white foam pulling back into the sea creating beautiful leading lines in your image. when you have rocks in the foreground and you want water splashing over them, shoot when the water is incoming. but the trick is often to wait until the water pulls back and then press the shutter button. i keep doing this until i see an image on my display that i like. then i move on to another composition. i try different shutter speeds from 0.5 - 2 seconds depending how rough the water is to see what looks best. just experiment.\n\n[a wave pulling back during a 1.6 second exposure creating

I\u2019ve read countless articles and warnings that Sony\u2019s mirrorless bodies are not good for astrophotography because of their \u201cstar eater\u201d issue where noise reduction gets applied to the RAW images, causing pixel sized stars to disappear. If you'd like to learn more there are super technical and in depth articles out there if you search \"sony star eater\".  Even with these articles out there I knew I wouldn't get a real sense of the issue until I saw it first hand\n\nSo last week I set out and shot identical photos with the Sony a7iii &amp; 16-36 f/2.8G and the Nikon D750 &amp; 14-24mm f/2.8. Each image was taken on the same tripod from the same location within minutes of each other. The settings were identical (~16mm, 25.0 sec, f/2.8, ISO 6400) and have identical processing/settings in Lightroom. (excluding white balance, which I had to make slightly cooler on the Nikon image to match). After looking closely at these images and many others from that shoot on the a7iii, I am incredibly happy with the results. Additionally, the a7iii performs better than the D750 at higher ISOs. My usual limit with the D750 is about ISO 6400 before noise becomes too much of an issue. I was shooting at IS0 12800 and higher on the a7iii and the noise was under control.\n\nHere is a link to the RAW images if you\u2019d like to edit yourself / pixel peep: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_sldth3T_7ij_DwoaYkcZDBMaIDPWOBi?usp=sharing.

One image taken with a Sony RX100 M3 and the other, a Samsung Note 8. Both images were shot in RAW, and processed in Lightroom. I did not use the exact same development settings, as each camera has different characteristics so I did my best to match the look by eye.\n\nI picked up a Samsung Note 8 back in October. Over the few months I've had it, I've been pleased with the images taken with when shooting in Pro mode to get RAW DNG files. I've found myself using my phone to take photos even when I've had my Sony RX100 M3 with me.\n\nI love my Sony. I got the RX100 M3 in 2014, right when it was released. Our first child was just born, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to bring my Canon 7D and lenses out with us to take photos of my daughter. I wanted a small camera that took great photos, and the RX100 M3 has not disappointed me. It became my main camera, replacing my (now very old but still good) Canon 7D. I've used my RX100 M3 a lot in the past 3 years and it's still going strong. When it does need to be replaced, it will probably be with another RX100, which ever version is out at the time. As much as I love the versatility of a DSLR and different lenses, I don't miss carrying that stuff around.\n\nI've been taking photos with my phone since I got a Sony Ericsson T610 back in 2003. I always found it to be for fun photos, or quick snaps. Never for taking serious or \"good\" photos. I did sort of have a period of really trying to take good photos once I got the original Samsung Galaxy S, working within it's limitations, and using those limitations (and filters via apps) to benefit the photos.\n\nMy phones since the original Galaxy S have been ok at taking photos. Good for a phone I guess. Both my Nexus 4 and OnePlus One did ok but neither blew me away in terms of quality. Having RAW support on the OPO was nice, and helped things but if I wanted to take a \"real\" photo, I had my RX100 M3 or 7D with me.\n\nOn a recent trip to Queenstown, New Zealand, I had three cameras with me; my Mavic Pro (drone), my RX100 M3, and my Note 8. The Mavic Pro can fly, so that had a specific use case and stands on it's own. My Sony takes great photos, so I knew I was going to use it. My Note 8, well that's my phone. It was everything we use our smartphones for, and does all of that really well. But I found myself using it to take photos. Photos that I wanted to keep, not just throwaways or for social media. I had moments where I could pull out my Note 8, launch the camera and take a photo, and not reach for my Sony as I knew that Note 8 would be... good, not just good enough.\n\nI did still use my Sony, and I think it's real win is that it's a dedicated camera with physical dials and buttons that I can tweak things as I need to. It *(The Sony RX100 M3 to clarify)* also does better in lower light or harsher lighting conditions. I also feel I can pull more from the  Sony's RAW files vs the Note 8's DNGs.\n\nWith all that said, I do feel that if I was out somewhere and I wanted to take a photo of my daughter or some landscape shot and I only had my Note 8, I don't think I would have that feeling of regret of not having my \"real camera\" with me. It just shows how much things have come from the old Sony Ericsson T610!\n\nEDIT - Maybe I shouldn't have posted this here, as I think maybe people will read this as me saying a Note 8 is as good as a dedicated camera. I'm not. I was just bored and noticed that the Note 8 did pretty good compared to my old Sony RX100M3. I thought it was interesting, in the most casual and general observation but I probably live a more boring life then you so I get amused easily.\n\nEDIT EDIT - Just so I feel like I can defend myself a bit, here's a link to my [Flickr photostream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rbrienza/page1). I share this so that you can see I ***try*** to take good photos, no matter what I'm using.

. one image taken with a sony rx100 m3 and the other, a samsung note 8. both images were shot in raw, and processed in lightroom. i did not use the exact same development settings, as each camera has different characteristics so i did my best to match the look by eye.\n\ni picked up a samsung note 8 back in october. over the few months i've had it, i've been pleased with the images taken with when shooting in pro mode to get raw dng files. i've found myself using my phone to take photos even when i've had my sony rx100 m3 with me.\n\ni love my sony. i got the rx100 m3 in 2014, right when it was released. our first child was just born, and i knew that i wouldn't be able to bring my canon 7d and lenses out with us to take photos of my daughter. i wanted a small camera that took great photos, and the rx100 m3 has not disappointed me. it became my main camera, replacing my (now very old but still good) canon 7d. i've used my rx100 m3 a lot in the past 3 years and it's still going strong. when it does need to be replaced, it will probably be with another rx100, which ever version is out at the time. as much as i love the versatility of a dslr and different lenses, i don't miss carrying that stuff around.\n\ni've been taking photos with my phone since i got a sony ericsson t610 back in 2003. i always found it to be for fun photos, or quick snaps. never for taking serious or \"good\" photos. i did sort of have a period of really trying to take good photos once i got the original samsung galaxy s, working within it's limitations, and using those limitations (and filters via apps) to benefit the photos.\n\nmy phones since the original galaxy s have been ok at taking photos. good for a phone i guess. both my nexus 4 and oneplus one did ok but neither blew me away in terms of quality. having raw support on the opo was nice, and helped things but if i wanted to take a \"real\" photo, i had my rx100 m3 or 7d with me.\n\non a recent trip to queenstown, new zealand, i had three cameras with me; my mavic pro (drone), my rx100 m3, and my note 8. the mavic pro can fly, so that had a specific use case and stands on it's own. my sony takes great photos, so i knew i was going to use it. my note 8, well that's my phone. it was everything we use our smartphones for, and does all of that really well. but i found myself using it to take photos. photos that i wanted to keep, not just throwaways or for social media. i had moments where i could pull out my note 8, launch the camera and take a photo, and not reach for my sony as i knew that note 8 would be... good, not just good enough.\n\ni did still use my sony, and i think it's real win is that it's a dedicated camera with physical dials and buttons that i can tweak things as i need to. it *(the sony rx100 m3 to clarify)* also does better in lower light or harsher lighting conditions. i also feel i can pull more from the  sony's raw files vs the note 8's dngs.\n\nwith all that said, i do feel that if i was out somewhere and i wanted to take a photo of my daughter or some landscape shot and i only had my note 8, i don't think i would have that feeling of regret of not having my \"real camera\" with me. it just shows how much things have come from the old sony ericsson t610!\n\nedit - maybe i shouldn't have posted this here, as i think maybe people will read this as me saying a note 8 is as good as a dedicated camera. i'm not. i was just bored and noticed that the note 8 did pretty good compared to my old sony rx100m3. i thought it was interesting, in the most casual and general observation but i probably live a more boring life then you so i get amused easily.\n\nedit edit - just so i feel like i can defend myself a bit, here's a link to my [flickr photostream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rbrienza/page1). i share this so that you can see i ***try*** to take good photos, no matter what i'm using. i even have some photos taken with a dslr!\n\nedit edit edit - if it buys me back some respect on this sub, sometimes i still long for my old sony alpha a100 with minolta 50mm f/1.7 that i sold off years ago. i mean that's an old lens paired with a sony camera before sony cameras were even cool!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 26671, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 280553, "autor": "rteyistoenr", "date": 1516589173000, "content": "San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize /!/ Hey all, I'm heading to San Pedro next month.

For many (most?) of us, including myself, this was the first time we'd ever worked with them. This is what I found out. \n\nMECHANICS\n\n1. Smoke bombs are fun. You want the Enola Gaye WP40 smoke grenades. They get about as hot as a hand warmer while they're firing. You can buy them online or at local paintball places.\n\n2. Smoke bombs are expensive. They average $7 a pop, they last 60-90 seconds, and the first and last 10 seconds or so will not be very photogenic.  And, as with every firework kind of thing, some of them will be duds. Out of the 16 I shot with, two refused to fire. \n\n3. Some of the bombs fire at both ends. They're called \"bursts,\" and it's easy to mix them up with the regular ones. The difference: the logos on the grenade should include arrows pointing both ways and the serial number will start with BWP instead of WP. They can be more dramatic but they also burn out in half the time.\n\n4. Even \"safe\" smoke bombs are still dangerous. Sparks will fly out when you pull the ring and may spit out a bit while the smoke is coming out. DO NOT AIM THEM AT ANYBODY. There were a couple of mild burns Sunday, at least once because we didn't know it was a burst and it shot from both ends when she pulled the ring. They're warm to hold -- gloves help -- but once they finish they will get hotter for a few minutes. The model should drop the expended bomb onto dirt, concrete or metal or into a bucket of water to avoid accidental fires. The shells can be disposed of once they cool.\n\n5. Colored smoke can color other things. Hold it too close to clothing, skin, hair or property and it will leave stains. The dye used is water-based so it should come out, but delicate clothing may suffer.\n\n6. Make sure you're allowed to fire them off where you're shooting. We had permission from a junkyard owner to use his property, but in many places you'll get yelled at and police or fire departments may get called. Many local and federal parks ban them. If you're planning on using a lot at one location, you may want to inform local authorities, especially if you're using white or black smoke. If you're inside a building, make sure anyone else in there knows about it.\n\n7. And, let's remember: it's smoke. It's not easier to breathe just because it's pretty. \n\n\nSHOOTING\n\n1. Unless you've got a trunk full of the things you won't have a lot of time to get your shots so plan them out first. If movement will be involved or you want the smoke in a specific trail, go through it with the model first without the grenade so they understand what you want and what they should do. Plan to waste the first few to get a feel for them.\n\n2. As the model moves the smoke bomb, be aware of where the trail is going so you can direct her what to do. Too much waving around face-level means no visible model. If you want a thicker smoke environment, have her make a couple of passes with it behind her before she moves it around to the front.\n\n3. Slower movements make thicker smoke trails. \n\n4. Keep the model moving. Smoke bombs provide rich, thick smoke that can be curled and twirled into shapes (when there's no wind). Models will appreciate direction while the smoke is firing because even more than usual, they have no idea what you're seeing. They can't tell what the smoke is doing or how they look, you have to tell them. And be aware of where the smoke is going. The image I attached shows one model looking great and the others blocked by smoke (and coughing).\n\n5. Wind is your enemy. Our biggest problem was a 10-15 mph wind that prevented much in the way of thick smoke clouds or well-defined trails. Unless you want the wind-swept look, and you might, get somewhere where the wind is blocked. If you shoot indoors or in a doorway, make sure it's well-ventilated.\n\n6. If you want wonderfully textured smoke trails, high shutter speeds are mandatory (think 1/2000). Then adjust ISO and aperture to suit. \n\n7. Light sources behind the smoke can add interesting looks, and light coming from the side adds definition to the smoke.\n\n8. Smoke can be shaped, temporarily. You can use doorways or overhanging branches to create enclosed areas of smoke, or use props like umbrellas or hats to catch it and play with it.\n\n9. Using smoke that matches the color of the model's clothing can make the scene more dramatic.\n\n10. Use the smoke as AN element of the pic, not as THE element. I was guilty of this too. Some of the best images I saw from this shoot were focused on the model's pose and expression, with the smoke setting the tone and adding texture and mood. Some of the shots -- including some of mine -- were clearly the photographer thinking \"Cool! Smoke! Look!\" Ideally you should have an image that would be amazing even without the smoke.\n\nWhat did I miss?\n\nEdited to add: Here's some of my shots from the day. https://imgur.com/a/rNAzU I went in with lots of plans for intricate shapes and designs, and thanks to the wind I ended up just winging it.

They\u2019re an extremely popular bird to both see and photograph, so I hope people will find this handy. \n\nThe most important thing to note before I move forward is that kingfishers are extremely vulnerable birds. They are very easily disturbed by humans, and in the UK at least are given additional legal protections. This means disturbing them is both immoral and potentially illegal, particularly if done near a nesting site. It goes without saying, but the number 1 rule in wildlife photography is to put the welfare of the subject first. I\u2019ve written this guide with that in mind, but if in the field you\u2019re unsure about something, always err on the side of caution.\n\nWith regards to equipment, photographing kingfishers on a perch isn\u2019t *too* demanding. I\u2019d recommend a lens of at least 300mm, but you don\u2019t need a high end camera (I certainly don\u2019t have one). Now for action shots (diving, BIF etc.) you most definitely do need a high end camera and a very capable lens, but for starting out that isn\u2019t an issue. Far more important than your camera is a good pair of binoculars, because 90% of your work will be done through them. \n\nSo the main thing to know about kingfishers is that they love to sit on low hanging perches above slow moving bodies of water. It is from these perches that they fish, that they eat, and that they preen on. Your aim, then, is to find a perch that the kingfisher likes to sit on. Naturally, the first step to doing this is finding a body of water that has a kingfisher on it. The easiest way to do this is search online: look on Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, Reddit etc. to see if anyone has seen or photographed a kingfisher near you. If they have, great! That\u2019ll make things easier. If not, well it is inevitable that kingfisher photography turns into a time sink so you might as well start now! What to do here is try to find out what bodies of water near you have fish in them.  Anglers are your friend here: broaden your search to see what fishing locations there are nearby, and talk to any that you see. The other (and more enjoyable) way of doing this is simply to spend a lot of time at nearby bodies of water, and just keeping an eye out and speaking to people. I find that just walking along the river with a supertelephoto lens leads to people coming up and talking to me about what they\u2019ve seen. My most recent kingfisher work hugely benefitted from talking to a dogwalker who pointed out to me where she saw a kingfisher perch a few days previously. Either way, once you have a potential kingfisher territory, you simply have to spend time by the water looking and listening for kingfishers going past. And by time, I really do mean significant amounts of time. Get comfortable, bring food and drink, and let the hours go by looking out for that brilliant flash of blue whizz past. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve found a body of water with a kingfisher resident, the next step is to find out where they perch. As I said above, they love low hanging branches over slow moving bodies of water, so as you explore the territory keep an eye out for potential perches. Then it\u2019s simply a case of trial and error: pick a perch, sit back and wait, and see if the kingfisher perches there. If it does, great! If not, move on to the next perch. Again, this will be a time sink, but as you get more experienced this does become easier. However, once you\u2019ve found a perch, know that kingfishers are creatures of habit, and it is extremely like to return there frequently. \n\nAt this point in the process, you\u2019re unlikely to have even touched your camera. Observation work ought to be done at a distance, through a pair of binoculars. But now that you\u2019ve identified a location, you can start to plan the photograph. There are two issues here: distance and light. Kingfishers are small birds, and even with a significant lens you\u2019ll still need to get relatively close to get a nice close up. The problem? Kingfishers don\u2019t particularly like people getting close to them. The solution to this depends on your circumstance. If the location is fairly remote, with few people ever going past, you can look into making a makeshift hide. If the location is more public, though, (as it is for me), you\u2019ll have to make do with your natural surroundings. On occasion, this can be impossible. One perch I found very close to my flat seemed ideal at first, until I realised there was literally no cover, and that I couldn\u2019t get close without disturbing the bird. Knowing when to walk away is an important skill. If you do have cover (foliage etc.), you\u2019re able to get closer, *but only if you\u2019re still and silent*. Even the act of lifting up your camera can be enough to disturb the bird if you\u2019re not careful. Ideally you\u2019d have your camera set up on a tripod, prefocused on the branch and with the camera in silent mode for minimum disturbance, but if you have to move do so very slowly and calmly. If you panic move the moment it turns up you will disturb it. And with regards to light, should be obvious to photographers but try to find out when the light is best at the particular spot. So again to use the example of my current spot, the sun is at my back in the morning, which is the only time I use it.  \n\nHopefully this guide will be enough to get you started on photographing kingfishers in the wild. It\u2019s unlikely this approach will get you the pixel perfect, creamy bokeh on a photogenic branch that many professionals get (this results from the use of a hide/purposely placing a chosen perch in the water yourself), but you will hopefully be able to get some wonderful natural shots of the birds, and of course just spending time with them is the real joy. \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9a75bc/guide_to_photographing_kingfishers/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "locations", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "guide to photographing kingfishers /!/ i\u2019ve been asked by a few people for advice on this when i\u2019ve posted photos in the community thread, so i thought i\u2019d make a separate thread offering an extensive guide to photographing kingfishers. they\u2019re an extremely popular bird to both see and photograph, so i hope people will find this handy. \n\nthe most important thing to note before i move forward is that kingfishers are extremely vulnerable birds. they are very easily disturbed by humans, and in the uk at least are given additional legal protections. this means disturbing them is both immoral and potentially illegal, particularly if done near a nesting site. it goes without saying, but the number 1 rule in wildlife photography is to put the welfare of the subject first. i\u2019ve written this guide with that in mind, but if in the field you\u2019re unsure about something, always err on the side of caution.\n\nwith regards to equipment, photographing kingfishers on a perch isn\u2019t *too* demanding. i\u2019d recommend a lens of at least 300mm, but you don\u2019t need a high end camera (i certainly don\u2019t have one). now for action shots (diving, bif etc.) you most definitely do need a high end camera and a very capable lens, but for starting out that isn\u2019t an issue. far more important than your camera is a good pair of binoculars, because 90% of your work will be done through them. \n\nso the main thing to know about kingfishers is that they love to sit on low hanging perches above slow moving bodies of water. it is from these perches that they fish, that they eat, and that they preen on. your aim, then, is to find a perch that the kingfisher likes to sit on. naturally, the first step to doing this is finding a body of water that has a kingfisher on it. the easiest way to do this is search online: look on twitter, instagram, flickr, reddit etc. to see if anyone has seen or photographed a kingfisher near you. if they have, great! that\u2019ll make things easier. if not, well it is inevitable that kingfisher photography turns into a time sink so you might as well start now! what to do here is try to find out what bodies of water near you have fish in them.  anglers are your friend here: broaden your search to see what fishing -----> locations !!!  there are nearby, and talk to any that you see. the other (and more enjoyable) way of doing this is simply to spend a lot of time at nearby bodies of water, and just keeping an eye out and speaking to people. i find that just walking along the river with a supertelephoto lens leads to people coming up and talking to me about what they\u2019ve seen. my most recent kingfisher work hugely benefitted from talking to a dogwalker who pointed out to me where she saw a kingfisher perch a few days previously. either way, once you have a potential kingfisher territory, you simply have to spend time by the water looking and listening for kingfishers going past. and by time, i really do mean significant amounts of time. get comfortable, bring food and drink, and let the hours go by looking out for that brilliant flash of blue whizz past. \n\nonce you\u2019ve found a body of water with a kingfisher resident, the next step is to find out where they perch. as i said above, they love low hanging branches over slow moving bodies of water, so as you explore the territory keep an eye out for potential perches. then it\u2019s simply a case of trial and error: pick a perch, sit back and wait, and see if the kingfisher perches there. if it does, great! if not, move on to the next perch. again, this will be a time sink, but as you get more experienced this does become easier. however, once you\u2019ve found a perch, know that kingfishers are creatures of habit, and it is extremely like to return there frequently. \n\nat this point in the process, you\u2019re unlikely to have even touched your camera. observation work ought to be done at a distance, through a pair of binoculars. but now that you\u2019ve identified a location, you can start to plan the photograph. there are two issues here: distance and light. kingfishers are small birds, and even with a significant lens you\u2019ll still need to get relatively close to get a nice close up. the problem?
