Not only are photographers hired because of their unique work experience, but also their marketing skills, business skills etc. \n\nAn artist can afford to worry less about his or her competition, they might be the only person in a region that does a specific form of art, and wouldn't have to worry about competition cause they're the only person to do it in the area. \n\nAn artist also has a very skillset that is more about the individual artist. They could sell works that are $400k, work half a year on a single art project etc. Whereas photographers have to hustle and do shoots to cover their expenses. \n\nAnd thus bringing to my point, because photographers all use one form of art for their work, it's alot more competitive than other forms of artworks. So it's natural, given the limited categories we all have, and the nature of how it's presented in competitions, clients, that photographers often see each other as a challenge. \n\nIt's easy to see someone as competition if your livelihood depends on it. It's typically not a salaried position so each bid for a job feels like you have to do your best to clinch it, and if your area is small, there's only a number of businesses who would need photographers. Not to forget, not everyone needs photographers all the time and there are low periods. \n\nI used to get very jealous of other photographers works, fearing I might not be able to get the same level as they've managed to, or if I have do the same category, not want to tell more about my clients out of fear that they might steal em. \n\nBut I quickly realised that there isn't any point in seeing other people in such a negative way. Nothing good comes out of jealousy. If you're good at what you do, are willing to adapt to the times and give clients something unique, they'll want to keep you because of who you are as a photographer, or they know you well enough and doesn't want to risk trying out a new photographer. And having good relations with other photographers help you in the long run. If I can help another photographer, I do my best.

Anyone else? /!/ Any fellow z6 shooters experience a sticky or laggy AF joystick after a burst of shots?\n\n\nDuring my last shoot (and maybe a few earlier ones too), there were a few instances where it seemed that the AF joystick on my z6 was briefly unresponsive. Physically/mechanically, the joystick is fine. But it seemed that the focus point was sticking and that I had to tap multiple times on the joystick to get the focus point to \u201cbudge\u201d. \n\n\nSo I tried an experiment today. \n\n\nSetup:\nMy camera Focus Mode was AF-S, and the AF Area Mode was Single-Point AF. I was using the native z-mount 50mm f/1.8s lens. (The same AF modes and lens as I was using in the most recent shoot). Also, the camera had a Nikon made EN-EL15b battery in it.\n\n\nI chose two objects separated by a set number of \u201cmoves\u201d (the number of taps on the joystick to get from one object to the other). The left-hand object was my laptop on my desk. The right-hand object was a floor lamp, just to the right of my desk. From a fixed camera position ~10 feet away, I framed a shot containing both the laptop and the lamp. If I placed the focus point over the laptop (my left hand object), I needed 8 right taps of the joystick to reach the floor lamp (my right hand object). \n\n\nHere\u2019s what I observed:\n- If I point my camera at the laptop, lock focus (I use the AF-ON button), and click the shutter **one time**\u00a0and then, immediately after, use the joystick to move my focus point, it works normally, and I can reach the floor lamp in 8 moves. \n- If I point my camera at the laptop, lock focus, and click the shutter **multiple times** (or do a short burst in Continuous \"H\" Release Mode), and then, immediately after, use the joystick to move my focus point, the focus point briefly sticks, and I have to tap right on the joystick one or two times first to get it to \u201cbudge\u201d, and then it works normally from there. This means it now takes 9 or 10 taps on the joystick to reach the floor lamp instead of 8. (A note: I typically use Single Frame Release Mode, but in this mode I sometimes click fast enough that I might be manually doing 2 or 3 FPS, which apparently is fast enough to cause this sticky joystick issue.)\n\n\nI can get around this problem by just pausing for a moment after a burst of shots before moving my focus point, but that\u2019s not a solution and it slows me down. This might not seem like a big deal, but in situations where my model is constantly moving and I\u2019m following her movements with the AF point while clicking multiple shots, all those extra taps make the joystick feel unresponsive.\n\n\nI can't help but wonder if this is actually \"normal\" behavior. During a burst of shots, the camera's focus point is locked (in both AF-S and AF-C). Could it be that doing a burst of shots locks me out of the joystick both during and for just a moment **after** the burst is over, so that when I tap the joystick right after the burst, the lockout is still active and that's why my focus point sticks??\n\n\nI\u2019m on firmware 3.0, but I think I was experiencing this issue before I updated. In past shoots, I thought I was just fumbling over the joystick and that\u2019s why I was sometimes slow when moving it around (I was accustomed to using a Nikon d750 with a directional pad). But as I have picked up the pace recently and I\u2019ve been shooting a lot more, I started to notice this issue more often, which led me do this little experiment. \n\n\nAre there any other Nikon z6 users in here experiencing this?\n\n\nI\u2019m sending this description to Nikon but I thought I\u2019d try it out here as well and see if anyone has any insights.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/feu8un/nikon_z6_sticky_af_joystick_issue_anyone_else/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "nikon z6 sticky af joystick issue? anyone else? /!/ any fellow z6 shooters experience a sticky or laggy af joystick after a burst of shots?\n\n\nduring my last shoot (and maybe a few earlier ones too), there were a few instances where it seemed that the af joystick on my z6 was briefly unresponsive. physically/mechanically, the joystick is fine. but it seemed that the focus point was sticking and that i had to tap multiple times on the joystick to get the focus point to \u201cbudge\u201d. \n\n\nso i tried an experiment today. \n\n\nsetup:\nmy camera focus mode was af-s, and the af area mode was single-point af. i was using the native z-mount 50mm f/1.8s lens.

It\u2019s a one of a kind film era hot shoe mounted viewfinder that... you can\u2019t see through! Inside is a set of backlit white framelines on a black field and optics to bring the framelines into focus. The trick is that you keep BOTH eyes open and the framelines are magically overlaid on top of reality. It\u2019s sort of like shooting with a bionic eye, haha. \n\nhttps://live.staticflickr.com/8538/8692089099_c6e869fe33_o_d.jpg\n\nAnyway, this got me thinking... my biggest gripe with mirrorless cameras (I shoot Sony) is that the EVF can sometimes feel disconnecting from reality and distracting compared to an optical viewfinder. Sometimes I just want to be focused on my subject and not my photo, if that makes sense. So, what if mirrorless cameras were to incorporate a Kontur style viewfinder into the EVF? There could be a central white dot (as the Kontur finders also have) indicating the position of center af point and framelines that correspond to the focal length of the lens you\u2019re using and change in size/position depending on the focal distance and focus breathing characteristics of the lens (or could just have dotted lines or corner marks indicating close focus parallax correction for manual lenses). \n\nI have two Kontur finders, one for ~40mm lenses (originally made for a normal lens on a 6x9 camera), and one for 35mm. I sometimes use them with my Sony cameras and in practical use they actually work really well. You would think that parallax would be an issue due to the framelines being stationary, but actually the convergence of your eyes mostly naturally compensates, at least in the horizontal direction. The vertical offset with the finder on top of the camera\u2019s viewfinder hump can be high at close range, but wouldn\u2019t be nearly so problematic if incorporated into the EFV itself. It\u2019s such a revelatory experience to shoot with your framelines just overlaid on your natural view of the world!  \n\nA mirrorless camera could easily overcome the parallax issues. The Fuji X-Pro and X100 series cameras already do this with their hybrid EVF. The camera could put focal distance scale at the bottom of the frame so that you get at least a rough idea of whether the AF hit your subject or not (like a Contax G2 if you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of shooting with one of those). Of course the frame would not be 100% accurate all the time (and might not work well at all for some people who\u2019s eyes don\u2019t work together well), but the EVF would always be available at the touch of a button.\n\nI mean, just think about how amazing it would be for your mirrorless camera to have a 1:1 life size rangefinder style \u201cviewfinder\u201d for every lens focal length (well, up to the limit of the viewfinder magnification/field of view) that works perfectly in even the darkest conditions. \n\nWhat do you think??", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/exablu/every_mirrorless_evf_could_be_a_11_optical/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "every mirrorless evf could be a 1:1 optical \u201cviewfinder\u201d! /!/ anyone ever heard of the voigtlander kontur external viewfinder? it\u2019s a one of a kind film era hot shoe mounted viewfinder that... you can\u2019t see through! inside is a set of backlit white framelines on a black field and optics to bring the framelines into focus. the trick is that you keep both eyes open and the framelines are magically overlaid on top of reality. it\u2019s sort of like shooting with a bionic eye, haha. \n\nhttps://live.staticflickr.com/8538/8692089099_c6e869fe33_o_d.jpg\n\nanyway, this got me thinking... my biggest gripe with mirrorless cameras (i shoot sony) is that the evf can sometimes feel disconnecting from reality and distracting compared to an optical viewfinder. sometimes i just want to be focused on my subject and not my photo, if that makes sense. so, what if mirrorless cameras were to incorporate a kontur style viewfinder into the evf? there could be a central white dot (as the kontur finders also have) indicating the -----> position !!!  of center af point and framelines that correspond to the focal length of the lens you\u2019re using and change in size/-----> position !!!  depending on the focal distance and focus breathing characteristics of the lens (or could just have dotted lines or corner marks indicating close focus parallax correction for manual lenses). \n\ni have two kontur finders, one for ~40mm lenses (originally made for a normal lens on a 6x9 camera), and one for 35mm. i sometimes use them with my sony cameras and in practical use they actually work really well. you would think that parallax would be an issue due to the framelines being stationary, but actually the convergence of your eyes mostly naturally compensates, at least in the horizontal direction. the vertical offset with the finder on top of the camera\u2019s viewfinder hump can be high at close range, but wouldn\u2019t be nearly so problematic if incorporated into the efv itself. it\u2019s such a revelatory experience to shoot with your framelines just overlaid on your natural view of the world!  \n\na mirrorless camera could easily overcome the parallax issues. the fuji x-pro and x100 series cameras already do this with their hybrid evf. the camera could put focal distance scale at the bottom of the frame so that you get at least a rough idea of whether the af hit your subject or not (like a contax g2 if you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of shooting with one of those). of course the frame would not be 100% accurate all the time (and might not work well at all for some people who\u2019s eyes don\u2019t work together well), but the evf would always be available at the touch of a button.\n\ni mean, just think about how amazing it would be for your mirrorless camera to have a 1:1 life size rangefinder style \u201cviewfinder\u201d for every lens focal length (well, up to the limit of the viewfinder magnification/field of view) that works perfectly in even the darkest conditions. \n\nwhat do you think??", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 78196, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 78492, "autor": "participationmedals", "date": 1591654033000, "content": "What is this little screw in front of the head screw on my Manfrotto 055?

COVID is still a thing.\n\nIgnoring COVID, however, this is not really an important data point. Take a look at Nikon's revenue over time, 2020 is incomplete, they end their year March 31st.\n\n[Nikon Annual Net Income](https://i.imgur.com/dvYwDEm.png)\n\nNotice how cyclical Nikon is? even though we are only 2/3rds of the way through this fiscal year, 2020 is still perfectly on track with this trend.

It's a harsh simplification, using a solely linear trend, but since we only have a few years, and only Nikon is so cyclical its the best way.\n\nIf Nikon is on death's doorstop, so is Canon, who have the exact same trend overall.\n\n#Sure, but Nikon is making bad products!\n\nLook I wont get into Gear War arguments with you, but Operating margin is a good measure of their product decisions.\n\nOperating margin is the profit from a product, divided by the revenue of said product. If you can sell a $20 item for $30, thats a margin of 50%. But if you can only sell a $50 item for $60 thats only a margin of 20%. In general, the better the item, the higher the margin. It makes sense logically, a luxury car maker like Rolls Royce is going to have higher margins than a volume car maker like Ford. In fact, over the last 10 years the former has a median operating margin of 9.26% with a max of 10.19%, while the latter has a median of -2.67% and a max of 2.41%.\n\n[Even if you include the shit show of 2020, Nikon's Net Operating Margin has been increasing](https://i.imgur.com/NjXPtVE.png)\n\nWhich makes sense since they KILLED it with the universally loved D850 and D7500 in 2017, which was when their margin really started to change. But their venture into mirrorless started in late 2018 (FY 2019) with the Z7 and Z6, and in FY2019 they were still going very strong. While their solid DSLR lineup is absolutely buffering this, it still shows they aren\u2019t struggling.\n\n[Theyve even began to do better than Canon](https://i.imgur.com/P9oh4pj.png)\n\n#Well Nikon is behind on the Mirrorless game, and will struggle to catch up!\n\nPlaying catch up is harder, yes, and they did start late BUT\n\nIn order to catch up, or to pivot, what they need is cash to use as capital into research and setting up manufacturing. Most of the cash in a business is obligated funds, like cash set aside for paying people's salaries in the next couple of months. Having a lot of cash on hand, however, puts you in a great position to move and pivot. You can buy into a whole new industry, or ride out bad financial times etc.\n\n[Cash on hand for Nikon and Canon](https://i.imgur.com/C8ng95L.png)\n\nNow this by itself does not tell us anything. Nikon could have more money simply because they have a lot of money tied up in working capital. What it does tell us, however, is that Nikon is in a very stable position. They have a massive amount of cash, nearly surpassing Canon, and a positive trend.\n\nThink of it this way, lets say tomorrow there is a new fancy fad, maybe everyone decides they want M43 again. Having more cash makes it easier to retool machines, buy adspace, etc. Lets say tomorrow the market crashes, who can afford to pay their bills more easily, someone with a lot of value in cash, or a lot of value in property?\n\nAgain, I am NOT saying Nikon is doing better than Canon, my point is solely that the articles talking about how Nikon is on the verge of death are dumb and should be ignored.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/k0t8uw/nikon_is_not_dying_they_may_not_be_in_an_amazing/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "nikon is not dying, they may not be in an amazing -----> position !!! , but they will be fine /!/ everywhere i look, people are acting like nikon is some poor beggar desperate to survive. i dont really blame people for this, i blame bloggers who know little to nothing about finance and business pushing \"facts\" without context. i am not a finance expert, but it takes very little effort to pull up their numbers and see for yourself. to be super clear, i am not trying to say nikon is doing well or that we should all buy up their stocks. all i am trying to show is that all this the end of nikon talk is nothing shy of shoddy journalism.\n\n*note: i do use nikon, but i have no loyalty. i literally only got locked into it because my ex used it when i started photography, and i dont care enough to rebuy all my lenses and such.*\n\n#nikon is doing so much worse than in 2019!\n\nyes. covid is still a thing.\n\nignoring covid, however, this is not really an important data point. take a look at nikon's revenue over time, 2020 is incomplete, they end their year march 31st.\n\n[nikon annual net income](https://i.imgur.com/dvywdem.png)\n\nnotice how cyclical nikon is?

I also need any HELP that someone with really good understanding of the optics of cameras and such can do. \n\n**THE LONG AND SHORT OF THIS PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERTISE NEED:**\n\nI'm looking to try to \"re-create\" a historical event in astronomy. Normally, you can do this easily with an astronomical simulator. However, this particular event needs something more complicated than that. ***I want to know how atmospheric refraction and air turbulence and changing contrast between the sky and the stars changes the view for a naked-eye astronomer.*** The BENEFITS of modern astronomy, telescopes, awesome layered images, long exposures, etc. is a WEAKNESS when it comes to trying to recreate what I'm doing. \n\nIn short, I need help on how to take a picture that EXACTLY MATCHES (as close as humanly possible) what an ordinary human eye sees. I will take ANY help I can get. \n\n**The Reason for the Experiment**\n\nI\u2019ll just get to the core of the matter, but please don't stop reading because you think I am a kook. I know how crazy this sounds, but it is what it is. Using an ordinary astronomical simulator, some historical research, and re-translating ancient manuscripts from their original languages, I found the astronomical event that is \u201cthe Star of Bethlehem\u201d in the Bible. Yeah, yeah... I know how crazy that sounds. But stay with me here until the end of this post. \n\n**The Background Research Done So Far**\n\nBack in 1968, Roger Sinnott published a famous article in Sky and Telescope magazine in which he identified two conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus on August 12 3BC and June 17 2 BC. He thought they could be related to the Star of Bethlehem. he first had the planets 12 arc minutes apart. The second had the planets 3 arc minutes apart. Sinnott concludes that this second conjunction (due to atmospheric refraction) would have looked like a single point of light in the sky. I had to get a copy of this article from the Library of Congress because there are no internet archives of Sky and Telescope available (even emailed the editors, no luck). But I got it.\n\nWith that copy, I looked up his footnotes and found that Sinnott did this measurement using Bryant Tuckerman\u2019s \u201c[Planetary, Lunar and Solar Positions 601 B.C. to A.D. 1 at 5-Day and 10-Day Intervals,](https://books.google.com/books/about/Planetary_Lunar_and_Solar_Positions_601.html?id=ByEtNvXnv4QC)\u201d from the 1960s to make these measurements. It was calculated using [an IBM 704 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704). (A dinosaur). As a result, the accuracy of the measurements is atrocious, even though the work of Sinnott is admirable.\n\nHowever, technology has advanced. If you use [VSOP87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_(planets)) (which is basically standard and super-accurate for the past few thousand years), we find that the distances of Jupiter and Venus are way closer than Sinnott believed. Rather than 3 arc minutes, on June 17, 2 BC, the distance was on 30 arc SECONDS apart (from the location of Bethlehem). From some places on earth, this event was a mutual planetary occultation. This has been noted before in books like Ernest Martin\u2019s \u201cThe Star of Bethlehem: The Star that Astonished the World.\u201d\n\nWhat I have found through my own research is that basically NOBODY pays attention to the earlier conjunction of August 12 3 BC, where the planets were in the eastern sky, about 30 degrees of separation from the Sun, visible between 3:45am and 5:20am (when the sun rose). From a viewing location of Baghdad, their distance was not 12 arc minutes, but instead ranged from 11 arc minutes to 9 arc minutes. **I believe there is something MAJOR here that is overlooked.** \n\nAs Evidence for this, I give you a few of my findings. There is a fun [paper published by an ophthalmologist](https://www.academia.edu/4982885/An_Ancient_Eye_Test_Using_the_Stars_GM_Bohigian_Surv_Ophth_08_53_5_) that tries to compare view of the stars with our modern way of measuring eye-sight. He found that two stars placed 12 arc minutes apart cannot be differentiated if one's vision is 20/30. That's a measure of visual \"acuity.\" Additionally, some people who were older in his experiment couldn't even tell the two stars apart, even though their visual \"acuity\" is 20/20, because other factors such as contrast sensitivity may come into play.  \n\nAs it relates to what naked-eye astronomers see and record, I have found evidence that pre-telescope naked eye astronomers saw conjunctions that were 7 arc minutes apart AT NIGHT (with perfect contrast) as \"shining without visible space between them.\" (See this [paper written by Salvo de Meis](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993JBAA..103..185D)). Because of this, I think it is possible to demonstrate that the same happened to Jupiter and Venus, which were a distance of 9 arc minutes apart in the rising dawn of the Sun. \n\nThis gives the following understanding of the \"Star of Bethelehm\" that the Magi saw. \"The Star\" is the combined light of Jupiter and Venus. It is true that no astronomical body, either real or hypothetical has been able to be matched to the strange motion that we see described in [Matthew 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2&amp;version=KJV): (\"we have seen his star in the east \" and \"lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.\") But the CONJUNCTION OF JUPITER AND VENUS INTO A SINGLE POINT OF LIGHT actually DOES fit! It's rather simple, really. \"The Star\" was seen on August 12, 3BC. Then it disappeared, and Jupiter and Venus \"went before them\" on their ordinary paths in the sky. Then, on June 17, 2 BC, \"the star\" that they had seen in the East ARRIVED back in a second conjunction. Then, it fell to the western horizon (because that's what all stars do) over a particular place from the perspective of a naked-eye observer of the stars. That perfectly fits what is described in Matthew 2, just not in the way we modern readers typically think of it. \n\nBut there is work to be done, especially on that first conjunction that was between 11 and 9 arc minutes apart. I need to PROVE that it would have been seen as a SINGLE point of light in the sky. Here's the photographic experiment I want to do, but I need some feedback from people with good photography knowledge to know where it falls short. \n\n**The Opportunity for the Experiment**\n\nWe have an upcoming event: On December 22, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn will have a conjunction in the Western sky. They will be about 30 degrees from the Sun (Just like the August 12, 3 BC conjunction was). \n\nThis means we can almost RECREATE the August 12 3 BC conjunction that Sinnott first identified! What we need to do is record it (by taking a photograph of it) in a way that PRESERVES what a NAKED EYE OBSERVER would have seen. In other words: \"No filter.\" No \"image magnification.\" No \"layered images.\" None of these \"look at this comet neowise looks!\" photo lies. (Impressive and beautiful photography, but not at all accurate).  \n\n**The Plan for the Experiment**\n\nThis is how I propose to do it. I think we need a group of photographers at various locations on earth. (The West Coast is actually a good observations spot from what I have seen on my simulator). They need to use one of those star-tracker mounts to get a steady camera view. They need to use a 50mm camera lens (because as far as I know, that mimics the human eye). The photograph should include some object at a fixed distance from the camera to preserve the right SCALE of the final printed picture (because even if you don't zoom, if you print it out 5 times the size, that still causes the same problem). We would need to take ORDINARY pictures (no image stacking, but I admit, this is where my knowledge is most limited). We should do it throughout the evening on December 22, 2020, until the conjunction is no longer visible. The pictures should have a time-stamp. Using that time stamp, we will have a series of pictures that show what a naked-eye observer would see (with atmospheric turbulance and all) over time. This recrates ONE HALF of the conjunction: The planet Jupiter at 30 degrees of separation from the Sun. \n\nSaturn is not as bright as Venus, but what Saturn CAN do is serve as the \"place holder\" for where Venus WILL GO when Venus also achieves an evening distance from the Sun of 30 degrees. The second part of the experiment is to wait until Venus reaches the same angular separation from the Sun. We repeat the experiment and get the data together. Then, using the location of Saturn as our place-marker, we use whatever photoshop wizardry we need to replace the light-output of Saturn with the accurate light-output of Venus. (This will happen sometime next year). \n\n**The Help I Need**\n\nIf I do a crowd-source experiment of astro-photographers, I need to know WHAT INFORMATION I SHOULD GET FROM THESE OBSERVERS. I need to produce a standard fill-in-the-blank form for them. I know I need to know the Camera (so we know the sensor), the lens (so we know the effect on the image). I know we will need the observing location (city or lat and long). I know we will need some information on the weather (Humidity, barometric pressure, and after that, I have no idea). \n\nIf anyone can help me standardize how to get that \"scale\" measurement in the photo, I would greatly appreciate it. The concept is something I understand, but the execution is not. I would need to be able to explain it to my helpers. \n\nWhen this is done, we will be able to recreate what the August 12, 3 BC conjunction looked like throughout that morning by reverse-engineering these observations of the Jupiter and Saturn conjunction and the Venus photographs. \n\nThat's the basic concept of the experiment, but I need some help from people who are much better at photography than me to take these pictures and who are more skilled in the optics to know how to render an accurate \u201creal-life\u201d view in a picture.\n\nPlease PLEASE give me any feedback you have on this idea. Additionally, PM me if you would like to help.\n\n**Proof That This Is Worth Your Time and That I'm not Crazy**  \nI know that people who usually claim that they've found the Star of Bethlehem are a little bit crazy and their theories are less-than-compelling. You might be wondering why I'm asking this on Reddit and not somewhere \"credentialed.\" The real reason is that astronomy and history are hobbies of mine, and I don't have credentials. I am a lawyer. Academic journals do not listen to me or even read my papers (trust me, I've tried). I need to be so rock-solid on my findings that there are no ways to deny it.\n\nUnfortunately, Reddit is the only place where people are as \"into\" their hobbies as I am. \n\nBut beyond that, I'm going to let you look into what I've found yourself. I'm going to reveal some of my research and link to the underlying sources.  \n\nAs you know, my theory is that \"the star\" of Bethlehem is a pair of close conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus. That's a nice and coherent theory, but how can I PROVE it? Well, I think I can.\n\nThe Roman Historian Tacitus in his Histories [at Book 5 Chapter 13](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.5.v.html) is talking about the Jewish Revolt in 70 AD, which was put down by Vespasian. As context for this revolt, he lists a bunch of \u201cprodigies\u201d or \"omens\" that were observed beforehand. These were the basis of a belief in the East (that is, the Parthian Empire) that \u201crulers, coming from Judaea, were to acquire universal empire\u201d or (as [recorded by Suetonius](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html)) \"men coming from Judaea \\[would\\] rule the world.\" Initially, I wondered where such a prodigy in \"the East\" (not Judaea, but \"the East\") would have come from. I became suspicious that it might be the Star of Bethlehem when I realized that \"the East\" is the same place the Magi were from and where they returned. \n\nHowever, I went back and looked at the document in its original Latin. The FIRST of these omens listed by Tacitus is translated into English as \"There had been seen hosts joining battle in the skies,\" which [in Latin is \"visae per caelum concurrere acies.\"](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.hist5.shtml) This translation seems to be made to agree with Josephus (Described in[Jewish Wars, Book 5, Chapter 5](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm)), who described another strange \"prodigy\" that occurred around this time: \n\n&gt; on the one and twentieth day of the month Artemisius, \\[Jyar,\\] a certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared: I suppose the account of it would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities \n\nHowever, I think this is a wrong translation. While the Latin word \"acies\" can be translated as \"an army drawn up for battle,\" it is not so clear that Josephus and Tacitus are reporting the same thing. What I came to find is that \"acies\" [really means is \"sharpness\" or \"sharp tool\" (think of swords drawn), or \"points\" or \"pupil of the eye,\" and even, in a metaphorical sense: BRIGHTNESS (think of swords on a ling of battle gleaming in the sunlight)](https://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/acies). This is why it is paired with \"armies\" or \"hosts\" in a way that is not natural to English speakers with bombs for war, instead of blades. Check that link to the Latin dictionary entry if you don't believe me. \n\nSo there is a different way to translate it. This means the \"prodigy\" that is related to the belief that \"men coming from Judaea would rule the world\" was described as **\"\\[visae\\] was seen \\[per\\] in \\[caelum\\] the sky \\[concurrere\\] running together \\[acies\\] POINTS.\"** \n\nWhen you actually observe the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus on August 12, 3 BC and June 17 2 BC in an astronomical simulator, you can see that this description matech PERFECTLY to this event, which moves just like the gospel of Matthew describes. This is a description in a non-Biblical 1st century text of the actual Star of Bethlehem, connecting it to a conjunction of two \"points\" in the sky: the planets Jupiter and Venus. \n\n**CONCLUSION** \n\nIf you can help me with this experiment that MUST be run on December 22, 2020, I can actually PROVE my point about the optics using science. \n\nIf you have expertise in these camera optics and photography skills, please comment below to help me out on how I should construct this. \n\nAnyone who would like to participate and make this happen, I'll even put you you on the academic paper I hope to publish if we can agree on the amount of work and stuff.

We arranged to meet at her office after she was done teaching an analog photography class, but instead found it to be more comfortable in the classroom itself. We then entered the classroom and sat down at the same, two chairs we would sit in when I took her class previously. This created an atmosphere and reminiscence, rather than a formal environment. Once we settled in and got the formalities aside, the questions started rolling and she was more than happy to oblige.\n\n**FR \u2013 Well, let\u2019s jump into the questions that no one wants to answer. When were you born and where?**\n\n**LK \u2013** I was born on December 16th, 1960, in Redwood City, California. It\u2019s just a bit south of San Francisco.\n\n**FR \u2013 And what was it like living there? Did you ever face any challenges, because you are female, growing up in that time?**\n\n**LK -** Honestly, no. I was very lucky. My parents were both well-educated people. My father attended UC Berkley and became a lawyer while my mom had studied at Stanford. My parents believed in me and that I could be what I wanted to be. It also didn\u2019t hurt to grow up in a progressive area, so, I must thank the privilege I was given in not being told what a woman ought to be like many others face.\n\n**FR \u2013 Interesting, that does sound good, not having any expectations imposed upon you. So, have you lived in California your whole life?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Oh no, when I graduated from high school in 1978, I went to go study literature at the University of Colorado.\n\n**FR \u2013 So, you weren\u2019t immediately drawn to photography?**\n\n**LK \u2013** No, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea of what I wanted to do, but I did know what interested me. I ended up studying English, Spanish, humanities, art, and music. This went on until I graduated in 1983.\n\n**FR \u2013 So, when exactly do you think photography first made an impression in your life then?**\n\n**LK \u2013** If I had to pick a defining moment, it would have to be in 1981 when I did a study abroad program in Spain. I spent a year there and was immersed in the culture. This forced me to have to quickly pick up Spanish as a second language. But anyways, I had a hard time relating to people and found one of the easiest ways to capture my feelings or see things universally, regardless of one\u2019s origin, was through photography. Everybody can see a picture and tell what it is if the subject matter is purely representational.\n\n**FR \u2013 So, did you use that newfound passion and pursue photography after you graduated?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Somewhat I would say. I lived in Boulder, Colorado for two more years after I graduated and pursued my own independent work. But of course, that\u2019s not going to pay the bills. Believe it or not, I got a job at the time that was called a plant technician. It was a do-nothing job. All I had to do was come into the office after hours and water any plants they had. Can you believe such a job existed? But hey, it paid my way while I did my exploration of photography.\n\n**FR \u2013 That does sound funny. But we all do what we must do. So, obviously you have your master\u2019s degree, because you\u2019re a full-time faculty member at CSU Fullerton. Where did you get your degree? And was photography your new course of study?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Yes! I did study photography for my master\u2019s degree. Well, the program was called experimental media, because it also focused on installations and lighting. I went to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1986 to get my master\u2019s, because the area was a great hub for artists, much like one would think of Los Angeles or New York.\n\n**FR \u2013 Wow, that must have been expensive! Did you save up money from your work as a plant technician? Or, did you have to take out student loans?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Actually, I submitted a portfolio from my independent work and was awarded a full scholarship! It paid for three quarters of the total cost for me to get my degree. I graduated with my master\u2019s in 1989 and did a few art shows during my time in Chicago.\n\n**FR \u2013 So, did you decide to come back to California after that to teach?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Nope. Believe it or not, my first teaching position was at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Now, that\u2019s the first place I ever experienced sexism, to no one\u2019s surprise. I mean, it is the south and what else would you expect?\n\n**FR \u2013 Was that the worst sexism you have ever faced?**\n\n**LK \u2013** No, but I\u2019ll save that for another time.\n\n**FR \u2013 Fair enough, so, when did you start teaching at CSU Fullerton?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Well, I left the other university in 1996 and came back to California. I spent about three years doing more photography work and then became a faculty member of CSU Fullerton in 1999. I have been teaching here for 20 years and became the department head of photography in 2008.\n\n**FR \u2013 Sounds like you found a place to settle in. Has it been a fulfilling job?**\n\n**LK \u2013** Absolutely, I love teaching. You get to meet a wide variety of people and get to keep learning, even as a teacher. I have had the privilege of meeting so many wonderful staff members and students over the years.\n\n**Conclusion \u2013** All in all, Linda Kroff was a very fun person to talk to. Her energetic personality and laid-back attitude made the interview feel more casual and less formal, which really allowed the conversation to happen organically. She was very informative and honest about her experiences. She was genuinely trying to give me advice about things that she wished she had known before entering the world of teaching, because that is an aspiration of mine after I work in my field of study for a bit. And especially, because of how open she was about the events in her life, she felt more sincere than others usually come off to be.

Mechanically, I have no idea how such a product could be streamlined and made lightweight, but I do believe that nothing is impossible, so I ask you all; is this already or could this soon be a thing? \n\nNote: I'm not a photographer, just a creative mind who gets ideas from his surroundings.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jfk36u/the_future_of_tripods/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "the future of tripods? /!/ watching a video from one of my subscribed channels, a well-designed tripod was one of the features of the video and it got me wondering: is there already or will there eventually (read: relatively soon) be an auto-leveling tripod? to my knowledge, currently, each leg has to be manually extended and locked in place. that's fine an' all, but i think there'd be a slew of sales for a tripod where you simply hold it at the height you need it at, push a button (or activate it in whatever other way), the legs \\[independently\\] extend to their respective resting points (regardless of level), lock in place, and retract (upon footage completion) back to their \\[locked\\] carrying -----> position !!!  at the press of a button (or again, some other method). mechanically, i have no idea how such a product could be streamlined and made lightweight, but i do believe that nothing is impossible, so i ask you all; is this already or could this soon be a thing? \n\nnote: i'm not a photographer, just a creative mind who gets ideas from his surroundings.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 90817, "year": "2020"}], "name": "positionphotography2020"}
