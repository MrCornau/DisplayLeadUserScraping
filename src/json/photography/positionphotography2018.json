I like to write short useful articles and I just came up with this one. This may all sound quite basic but I feel like I need to point this out because I see so much of the same stuff online. I want to encourage people to be creative, even if it\u2019s just for the sake of trying something new or different. \n\nThis article is both for beginners and advanced landscape photographers. I figured I\u2019d list some tips to hopefully give you some inspiration and give you some new options to try out in your landscape photography. With the era of social media I notice a lot of people just copy photos they see on Facebook or Instagram. This happens to me a lot. I always try to be creative and find \u2018new\u2019 angles myself. For some people getting creative comes naturally, but others will need a bit of a push. This article will hopefully help :) Here are 10 tips that will hopefully be helpful to get that bit of extra in your shots.\n\n1) Most landscape photos are shot with wide lenses. I love wide lenses myself, but try a telezoom once and experiment with long focal lengths of 100-300+. Try photographing patterns or small details in landscapes. Or try it in the mountains on mountain tops. Once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll notice a whole new world of landscape photography opens. Seriously, try it.\n\n[Green Hills close up at 300mm](https://i.imgur.com/Tsjk3v5.jpg)\n\n2) Play with motion. Clouds move, water moves. Try to create dynamics in your frame by the use of moving water or clouds. You can do this by using long or short shutter speeds. You can make use of filters to create longer exposures, or create drama with very short exposures. Always experiment with different lengths of exposure with both clouds and water.\n\n[Short exposure to capture drama](https://i.imgur.com/cNqqXYl.jpg)\n\n[Long exposure of the same scene with a different composition to create a totally different mood](https://i.imgur.com/yOh6pLL.jpg)\n\n3) Experiment with a CPL filter. I have done landscape photography without a CPL filter for years. But once you have one, you start to see why it can be so useful in different cases. It can be especially useful to control the amount of sunlight and reflection on reflective surfaces. You simply can\u2019t do this in post production.\n\n[Example of Rotating CPL effect on reflective surface](https://media.giphy.com/media/1o1u6VbxA54uBMCMlc/giphy.gif)\n\n4) When photographing with longer lenses use layers and compression. Landscapes look totally different with long lenses and you can compress foreground and background objects to give a lot of depth in your photo. \n\n[Compressed Road shot at 135mm](https://i.imgur.com/vrRBVGd.jpg)\n\n[Including a person with a long lens shot at 200mm](https://i.imgur.com/OZYvTbU.jpg)\n\n5) Use light to your advantage. Light always changes especially during sunsets and sunrises. Look for details here and isolated objects by light. This happens a lot in the mountains where clouds and light play around peaks go on during the whole day. \n\n[First Morning Light hitting a mountain peak](https://i.imgur.com/yI0maQn.jpg)\n\n6) When shooting with wide angles, get very close to objects to create a lot of depth in your photo. With \u2018very close\u2019 I mean VERY close. So close that your lens almost touches the foreground object. This can be a flower, a plant, or anything. You can use focus stacking to get everything in focus, or choose to pick a very wide open aperture to get the foreground completely out of focus/blurry. Both choices offer different looks and can both be used in nice ways.\n\n[Getting very low and close with Out of Focus foreground](https://i.imgur.com/xZQ3bLL.jpg)\n\n[Getting very low with focus stacking](https://i.imgur.com/cq7euyj.jpg)\n\n7) Make use of sunstars in your composition. When shooting directly in to the sun and closing down your aperture to f/16-f/22 you will see that your lens will create a sunstar. Different lenses have different characteristics. Some lenses create beautiful sunstars and you may want to make use of them. Position the sun against an edge, like the horizon or just an object in the frame. By positioning it slightly against an edge, the sunstars will look best. Try and experiment!\n\n[f/22 sunstar with the sun peaking just over the treeline](https://i.imgur.com/T3fxCrA.jpg)\n\n[Sun just touching the edge of an object to create a sunstar](https://i.imgur.com/tb42rPC.jpg)\n\n8) Learn how to shoot with extreme wide angle lenses and fisheye lenses. By extreme wide I mean wider than 14mm (full frame equivalent). Photographing at 10-12mm or wider with fisheye lenses give you a whole new perspective to a landscape. It opens up lots of (creative) possibilities. Learn the \u2018defish\u2019 technique also that makes it possible to create an undistorted shot out of a fisheye shot (not going to describe the technique here, but can be found online. I also have a Youtube tutorial about it). This can be extremely useful for photographing very wide landscapes.\n\n[Vertigo shot with 180 degree fisheye and corrupted with lens profile](https://i.imgur.com/TXya83Y.jpg)\n\n\n[Wide scene shot with 12mm fisheye 180 degrees, corrected so no distortion appears](https://i.imgur.com/Uzi8Pjr.jpg)\n\n9) Don\u2019t always immediately take your camera out and look for potential frames. Walk around in nature and use your eyes. Try to visualise how things would look through your camera. I also often use my smartphone, which has an around 20mm field of view. Simply to check framing.\n\n[random spot I found next to the road](https://i.imgur.com/yskqooz.jpg)\n\n10) Last, this may sound very obvious but it\u2019s important to train your eye nonstop. Look around you everywhere and try to see potential compositions in every day life. This may sounds hard and being a landscape photographer can be very tiring because of the nonstop possibilities nature offers. You train your eye by using a wide array of lenses so that you know how things will look through an extreme zoom lens, or how things would look with an extreme wide angle.\n\n[Cold Morning, Just looking around](https://i.imgur.com/DdeHidC.jpg)\n\n\nHope these were useful.

They commisioned me to work on several different shots for a range of nail polishes they are looking to market. Again, I was put in charge of coming up with the creative angle and had the freedom to explore and execute the final result. The client was open to any suggestions or ideas, and I had fun putting it all together.\n\nMy vision was to keep the design simple yet unique and deeply orientated towards the brand and product on show. Nail polish bottles are generally a small object and require slightly different treatment than, say, photographing a large carry bag. The bottle needed to be centered and close up enough to capture the logo and brand name. Each bottle was cubed-shaped, with a matt-pastel color, the same as the gel nail polish inside. The lids (bottle tops) were long, frosted-gold colored. This color really illuminates the final image and casts long diagonal lines as the viewer follows it up.\n\n## The Setup and Using Splashes\n\nAs this project is not a single image, but rather a series of images, I tried to create something that flows like a story. After brainstorming and running through different ideas, I found a particular genre of still life photography to be most suitable. Splash is the art of capturing liquid in motion. Splash is a classic genre, and it is popular to take splash templates and use them as backgrounds or additions to your image. It does require some knowledge of Photoshop and other editing software to manipulate. I chose to create a splash specifically for this project, and not take advantage of an existing one from other artists.\n\nI experimented with several different liquids, from organic to synthetic mixtures. The mixture or liquid needed the consistency and fluidity to fit the brand and idea. Eventually, I settled with a classic, white acrylic wall paint. A water-based solution worked best for this project. Pouring the liquid by hand from a raised position into a container below, I hoped to capture interesting patterns. The setup was a standard white background positioned not far behind the table. On the table, I had a container to catch the paint as I poured it from above. I repeated this pouring step multiple times until I found some splashes worth editing and merging with the nail polish bottles. The products were shot individually. This particular project required more post-production editing than usual. Software like Photoshop was used to achieve the final results.\n\n## To End\n\nThe client and I agree that the final results are satisfying. The elegance of the brand complements the creativity and flow of the photograph. The online community expressed an interest in learning more about splash. As well as, praising the final results. Furthermore, the client originally made me withhold the results until they have rolled out the new marketing material.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9ra645/still_life_photography_of_nail_polish_in/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "still life photography of nail polish in whirlpool of splash /!/ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykeeci1lvto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykeeci1lvto)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n![img](ca7yap710cu11)\n\n## the brief\n\nfor this project, i was tasked with creating hero images for a cosmetic brand. they commisioned me to work on several different shots for a range of nail polishes they are looking to market. again, i was put in charge of coming up with the creative angle and had the freedom to explore and execute the final result. the client was open to any suggestions or ideas, and i had fun putting it all together.\n\nmy vision was to keep the design simple yet unique and deeply orientated towards the brand and product on show. nail polish bottles are generally a small object and require slightly different treatment than, say, photographing a large carry bag. the bottle needed to be centered and close up enough to capture the logo and brand name. each bottle was cubed-shaped, with a matt-pastel color, the same as the gel nail polish inside. the lids (bottle tops) were long, frosted-gold colored. this color really illuminates the final image and casts long diagonal lines as the viewer follows it up.\n\n## the setup and using splashes\n\nas this project is not a single image, but rather a series of images, i tried to create something that flows like a story. after brainstorming and running through different ideas, i found a particular genre of still life photography to be most suitable. splash is the art of capturing liquid in motion. splash is a classic genre, and it is popular to take splash templates and use them as backgrounds or additions to your image. it does require some knowledge of photoshop and other editing software to manipulate. i chose to create a splash specifically for this project, and not take advantage of an existing one from other artists.\n\ni experimented with several different liquids, from organic to synthetic mixtures. the mixture or liquid needed the consistency and fluidity to fit the brand and idea. eventually, i settled with a classic, white acrylic wall paint. a water-based solution worked best for this project. pouring the liquid by hand from a raised -----> position !!!  into a container below, i hoped to capture interesting patterns. the setup was a standard white background positioned not far behind the table. on the table, i had a container to catch the paint as i poured it from above. i repeated this pouring step multiple times until i found some splashes worth editing and merging with the nail polish bottles. the products were shot individually. this particular project required more post-production editing than usual. software like photoshop was used to achieve the final results.\n\n## to end\n\nthe client and i agree that the final results are satisfying. the elegance of the brand complements the creativity and flow of the photograph. the online community expressed an interest in learning more about splash. as well as, praising the final results. furthermore, the client originally made me withhold the results until they have rolled out the new marketing material.\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 17171, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 271946, "autor": "Lipsia", "date": 1543604167000, "content": "Is there a way to find out the camera's exact position by using a photo and Google? /!/ Hello, everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause my camera doesn't have a GPS and I didn't want to keep it connected to my Smartphone all day long I'm adding the position manually using Google Earth + Street View.

It's crazy! This technique allows so much freedom! Yet, I guarantee that hardly any of you have touched the double exposure setting on your camera since getting it out of the box (if at all).\n\nSo I decided to make a post about it.\n\n## How do double exposures work?\n\nThere are two types of double exposures: in-camera and post-production. In-camera double exposures are when you take two photos on a single frame. It started in film photography where you could rewind the film, then shoot over the same frame again. The end result is the literal sum of the two images.\n\nThe digital method involves importing and manipulating the images in Photoshop. This method gives you full control, so the possibilities are endless!\u00a0\n\nThe trick to double exposures is to understand exactly what an exposure is. The best mental image that I can use to explain double exposures is to imagine each double exposure is like a glass of water.\u00a0An empty glass is an area of underexposure and the completely full glass is an area of overexposure. Got that in your mind? Great!\n\nIn a 2 shot double exposure, we get two pours to fill the glass. If you underexpose an area of the first image (empty glass), more of the second image will be used to fill the glass. Conversely, overexposing an area of the first image will ensure that there is almost no effect of the second image on the overall composition.\n\n\u201cIf you fill your glass on the first pour, there\u2019s no room for more!\u201d\n\n[If your having trouble visualising it there is a demonstration in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdTj_N5ZPsU)\n\n## Gear for Double Exposure Photography\n\nYou need a camera (digital or film) that allows you to take double exposures (in camera). As far as digital cameras go, I am aware that the following have an inbuilt function:\n\n\u2013 Canon EOS 5D Mark III, 1D X and 70D;\n\n\u2013 most Nikon DSLRs;\n\n\u2013 Fujifilm\u2019s X-T1, X-Pro1 and X100s;\n\n\u2013 Olympus OM-D E-M5.\n\nMost higher-end digital cameras have a double exposure option so just check your camera or your manual. You know the thing that is still in plastic, in the box.\n\n# In the film camera world you can check out the following:\n\n\u2013 All of the Nikon FM/FE/FA FM\n\n\u2013 Canon AE-1\n\n\u2013 Konica T3, T3N and T4\n\n\u2013 Contax 139 and 159MM\n\n\u2013 Minolta XD, XE-1 and XE-7\n\nThere are a lot more but these are some of the more common ones online that you can pick up on eBay rather cheaply.\n\n## Got a camera and I get the glasses of water, how do I do it?\n\nPortraits are the quintessential double exposure. This is because it is easier to control the exposure of background against the subject. You can fairly easily get a decent result. But, remember that (in camera) double exposures are about embracing the irregular and creating beauty through randomness. So start here but then let your mind wander. We'll get to other inspiration below.\n\n### The first image\n\nTake the first of the two photos by aiming the camera directly at your subject. Meter the image from the darkest part of the subject, or put it/them in front of something bright (like the sun). If you are unsure of the metering system then underexpose the image by 1-2 stops. This lessens the probability of you overexposing everything.\n\nYou can do this on a film camera by changing the film speed up one stop (from 100 \u2013 200 or 200 \u2013 400). On a digital camera, you can adjust the exposure compensation to -1. This will put the subject in a slightly underexposed position. The background will be heading towards overexposed (if not completely overexposed).\n\nDrawing this back to our glass analogy, we have the pixels (glasses of water) for the subject around 1/3 full, ready for more information. The surrounding pixels (background glasses of water) should be full or near full. This means that they have little/no capacity to absorb more information. That is what we want.\n\n### The second image\n\nFor the second image, you are looking to find something with a lot of colour and texture. Make sure whatever you are photographing is **well lit**. This goes a long way to making the final image something that will capture your eye. Think things like autumn foliage, flowers, trees, sunsets, cloud patterns, textured wallpaper etc. If the texture isn\u2019t uniform then you need to think about where in the frame your subject was and ensure that it is distributed across this area.\n\nWhen I do this I always try to fill the frame with the textures as evenly as possible. Providing you have taken the first image correctly (with the background heading towards overexposed) you should be fine.\n\n## Earlier you mentioned photoshop?\n\nPhotoshop can be used if you do not have a camera that an inbuilt multiple exposure functions. Or you can use it to create the \u201cperfect\u201d image.\n\nStart with your initial layer as the \u201csubject\u201d photo. Open this image in photoshop. Next, open your texture image as the second layer of the image.\n\nMake sure that both images are highlighted and select \u201cmultiply\u201d from the drop-down menu under the layers window. \u00a0Now alter the exposure of the image until you get the look that you are after.\n\nAs far as photoshop is concerned there is really no limit. You can create whatever you can dream of. Just imagine any two images and with enough skill and manipulation, you can combine them. I won\u2019t go too much into this as at some point it becomes composite photography \u2013 adding parts of different images together into a single image.\n\n## Is that it?\n\nNoooo never! It took me a while to build up this visual analogy of the glass of water in my head. But once you can understand that, you will have a much easier time attempting to blend the images in camera. I find that having some results early in a project like this will spur you on to get more creative. That is why I wrote this tutorial and made this film!\n\nAgain, don\u2019t be afraid to throw the glass of water off the table and experiment. Once you have the basics down, you can get crazy. Here are some more ideas to get you inspired:\n\n\u2013 Start experimenting with all different types of textures.\n\n\u2013 Think about using different subjects from different perspectives.\n\n\u2013 Try blending two completely different images to make a single image that portrays a story.\n\n\u2013 Take a close-up shot of your subject, then another shot further away, or at another angle.\n\n\u2013 Use different coloured flash gels to take multiple exposures of a subject in different colours.\n\n\u2013 Put your camera on a tripod and take an image of yourself or a subject, then have them move and take a second exposure.\n\nHopefully this helps inspire some of you to take up the challenge and shoot some double exposures. It is becoming a long lost art in the world of photography and it really shouldn't be.

So let's change things up a little and do some story telling.  \nI've posted this as a comment elsewhere, and I feel like you guys would enjoy this. Disclaimer: I'm a wedding photographer in Asia. The stories contain some crude language, sorry 'bout that.   \nSo first story, typical wedding, everyone was drinking and laughing. Right before the ceremony, groom's dad is already drunk, and made a huge racket. Groom started crying because his special day is ruined... and then started fucking hitting the old man. Yes. He hit his own dad with a wine bottle to the head, clean swing, no hesitation. Police was called and everyone was evacuated. No charges were made, and they did finish the ceremony later on, but I never got the last 30% of payment...  \n  \nSecond story, really sweet couple, quite young and inexperienced. During the ceremony infront of about 200 people, the groom hesitated to kiss the bride out of (seemingly) awkwardness. I mean, kissing in front of 200 people, I would be quite embarassed too. Out of nowhere, bride broke into tears and ran off, I guess she felt insulted? The groom just stood there, frozen in disbelief while guess started throwing things at him. Even glasses and silverware. Yes, I know, my weddings are violent.  \n(Ps: some guy threw flowers at him, which I found hilarious).  \n  \nThird one: Bride danced too hard at the after-party rave and passed out. Groom could not carry her back because she was quite overweight. I'm pretty sure people were either high or shit-faced drunk, because nobody stopped dancing to help the poor lady. Now, you gotta sit back and imagine the scene. Dark, clubby atmosphere with flashing lights and lazers. People dancing around having the time of their lives... around a passed out bride, right in the center of the room. Oh boy what I'd give to have permission to post that photo.  \n  \n4th story. Bride's parents, when asked for a speech, started cursing the couple in the middle of the ceremony. Apparently they didn't approve the marriage but attended anyways. MC did not know this and innocently gave them the mic. This went on for a good 10 minutes or so. You should see the absolutely terrified look on the MC's face. Poor girl was sure she's going to lose her job. The marrying couple was somewhat nonchalant, I guess they expected it to happen... while the MC looks like she's about to cry.  \n  \nAnd lastly, I don't know if I'd label this funny or sad but this couple invited *[a very famous band]* to perform for their wedding. After they've finished their set, the room got visibly empty. Like seriously, half of the guess left. I'm in no position to make statements, but I'm pretty certain most of those people snuck in just for the free performance. Bride and groom laughed it off, at least the wedding photos was grand and extravagant due to the crowd.  \n(That band is the biggest hit in the country right now.

The grip seems to be even deeper than that of the 1DXII. The rest of the body feels sturdy and much better than that of the M5. This compares to a 5D build quality and less that of the 6D. But the 5D and 1DX use this very coarse surface which makes them feel more rugged. This is more soft and luxury oriented. Also it's not light as a feather which is IMO a good thing most smaller lenses balance perfectly on this, even the 100-400mm seems to work well. I wouldn't take it out into heavy rain though. All the covers are thin and there is barely any room for gaskets. But I'd guess it would survive light rain easily.\n\nThe AF-ON button as most reviewers criticised is IMO not even that badly placed, if you press it with the side of your thumb instead of the tip, it's adequately positioned and you can rest the tip on the wheel at the same time. But even with the tip it's OK.\n\n#Customisation\n\nThis camera is more customizable than my 1DXII, and not just by a bit... Every button (and I mean every, including the display light button for the top display) can have pretty much every function available. I can even set the * button to be the wheel override button, which previously was only possible with the SET button. (This allows the scroll wheel to not adjust Tv or Av but ISO or EV-Comp while it's depressed, I love this feature and use it constantly).\n\nWhat does this mean? I was able to reassign most of the buttons to do what I want. M-Fn button is now my \"eco mode\". The backlight button is now  sleep (display off). The \"AF Selection mode\" button is my Eye focus switch etc. Everything is accessible right there without going into the menus. Not that I ever had this problem with my DSLRs given that they neither need a sleep button nor ECO mode, so this isn't meant as a burn against their DSLRs but a \"good job, Canon\" since they knew, this is a must have feature when there is much more packed into a camera with the same amount of buttons.\n\nCan't talk about the lens wheel, given that I don't have an R lens nor the adapter with it. But the menus reveal, that I can set pretty much any function to it. EV comp, ISO, Av, TV etc.\n\n#Function Bar\n\nFirst things first: It's not that bad. The left/right \"buttons\" are easy and not difficult at all to use. You even get a visual feedback on screen (I set the left button to show the histogram and the right to show electronic level). The scroll function is average. For long scrolling, a wheel just feels better since there is an active feedback. But I set it to change AF modes and because there are only a few of those I can almost scroll through them all in a single swipe.\n\n#Image quality\n\nSame as the 5DIV ;p JPG processor might be a bit different but the sensor is most likely the same. Images further down below.\n\n#AF\n\nIt's quick, surprisingly quick. Easily beats the M5, I would even argue it's up there with the 5DSR if not faster. Since this is highly subjective, try it out before buying!\n\nThe AF modes are pretty much the same as in DSLRs except the tracking mode which either picks up on faces or tracks whatever you select. Since I'm a DSLR shooter, I mainly use the fixed AF points and move them around with the touch screen. It's different, but after a while you're getting used to it. \n\nAs I said before the focus is quick, even with the 85mm f/1.2 II. And anyone who ever used that lens knows, that's an incredibly slow focusing lens. Really astonished how well it works.\n\nSince this is a mirrorless, the AF points go pretty far into the corners, and it seems to be working fine even with lenses that aren't even sharp at the edges. I'm not sure how they managed to do that especially since it doesn't stop down to focus. So either it knows that these lenses aren't sharp or it just tries to find the best possible focusing position. Either way, I'm impressed.\n\nFor those who love to shoot with manual focus lenses (only lenses that have electronic connections). You can set the AF point wherever you want and it will simulate a split prism. Basically two arrows on either side of the AF point and the closer you are to perfect focus, the closer they move together until they meet and light up green. Pretty cool! So anyone who has for example the MP-E 65mm (that weird 1-5x macro lens) it will show you if you are in focus. This is awesome! \n\n#EF Adapter\n\nSince there are currently no R lenses out, I'm \"forced\" to use my EF lenses. Nothing to worry though, they focus well. The adapter is solid and the mount itself is pure metal. I even attached the 500mm f/4.0 and I wasn't worried about holding the full weight of the lens through the grip. Tough little mount. Love it. AF works great with all my lenses, the longer ones might have some hunting when it's completely out of focus BUT I'd argue for large birds in flight and a little bit of getting used to it this could be a reasonable body (except of course the FPS ;p)\n\n#Connectivity\n\nBluetooth works fine. Wifi also quite surprisingly nice, you can set it up so it will upload new pictures whenever it's in the same network as the paired computer. Cool feature, but I can't imagine uploading 64GB of pictures through Wifi... Also I couldn't get it to work manually, it seems like you have to restart the camera, also don't connect anything to the USB port otherwise it won't even start the WiFi.\n\nUSB cable is a different story. They ONLY supply a USB-C to USB-C cable. Who has a USB-C port on their computer unless they bought one in the last two years? Sucks. Adding to that when you use your own USB-A to USB-C cable, it won't connect properly and starts to fuck around. I wasn't able to transfer any pictures... Had to do it all over Wifi... I sure hope this is more a driver issue than anything else.\n\nMost reviewers also said that most USB-C loading cables won't work but surprisingly the Nintendo Switch loading cable is compatible. So no need to buy a $100 + adapter, just get the Switch! But it looks like it only loads when the is camera turned off.\n\n#Overall Impression\n\nGiven that I bought this camera and I adore Canon bodies/lenses, I'm heavily biased. So it's no surprise that I love this camera. It will replace my M5 and 5DSR. It's truly the first good mirrorless by Canon and even though I'd love to have a scroll wheel around the set button since I'm so used to it, I still like it. Awesome little camera, I wish I already had the EF adapter with the scroll wheel, but this will do for now ;p\n\nI know people are hating Canon for how far behind they are with this camera. But beside the few tech shortcomings, this is a solid camera. It just works as advertised.\n\n#Picture Time\n\nSince this is basically the 5DIV sensor, I'd assume the IQ is equal. My editing path since Lightroom is still incapable of opening the RAW files: Photo Professional -&gt; TIFF -&gt; Lightroom. \n\nEditing: 0 sharpening (some soft edges, either from AA filter or the lens, with a bit of sharpening it's not really an issue), 0 noise reduction, no lens correction (neither CA nor distortion), no picture profile. Some highlight/shadow tuning.\n\n[Tinguely Fountain \\#1](https://i.imgur.com/7r5pmDo.jpg) ^[[FullRes](https://i.imgur.com/YqRf7XK.jpg)]\n\nArea focus on the fountain.

Some of the most interesting people I've met, I've met by shooting them. Building rapport becomes a lot easier when you're trying to get someone to laugh for a photo. Thanks to portrait photography I've grown to appreciate people's differences and idiosyncrasies a lot more. \n\n* **You control the pace of the engagement**\n\nOne of the scary things for me about social settings is the fear of being put in uncomfortable positions where I'm not sure how to act or respond. With portrait photography, typically the model is looking to you for direction and will frequently match your energy. This is one of the few social opportunities you get where you can dictate the pace and flow of the interaction. If you're looking to learn to get out and be more comfortable with talking to people ,this is the perfect place to practice\n\n* **It's very rewarding**\n\nIf you become good at it, there's few greater feelings than showing someone a photo that allows them to see themselves in a better light than before. The jaw drops and wow's you receive from showing someone an unedited photo on the back of you camera releases a hell of an amount of endorphins, plus earn the respect of those around you. \n\nPortrait photography isn't for everyone, but I'd urge anyone who's staying away from it to try it sometime. True, you may encounter some people who aren't the most pleasant to be around and thus may not get the advantage of some of the things I listed above, but maybe brushing off people you don't like is a valid lesson in itself.

I think I figured out the problem. There was a spring loose (see the pictures), that pulls the aperture blades in the closed position as you move the ring. The problem is, I don't know where is that spring supposed to be hooked up. I've searched the internet all over, but haven't found a single useful information. I've attached some photos, to try and show you how the thing works and what I think is the problem.
