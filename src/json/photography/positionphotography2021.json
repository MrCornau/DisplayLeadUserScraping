I\u2019m a semi-professional photographer (read: not my day job) who specializes in live events, architectural, and specialty photography. Most of my work is within my local city for private businesses and the city government itself. The use of my images is primarily for marketing purposes and centers around social media use and promotion of the businesses and events for those who hire me.\n\nRecently a \u201clarge corporate entity\u201d (not to be named) has begun a campaign to advertise their presence in the city and is showcasing a lot of the businesses and events found here using some familiar images. I am fairly certain they obtained those images from the city, who originally hired me to to photograph them, even though I have a clause in my contract that limits use beyond the original licensee (no sub-licensing). The good news is that I\u2019ve been put in touch with this larger entity and they are asking to directly license several images for use, and these include the photos that have already been shared on social media. (Yeah, I\u2019m a little concerned that this happened in reverse though I\u2019m not going to ruin a good relationship and I\u2019m glad to have a proper path forward.)\n\nThat said, I am no stranger to licensing my images for various purposes though that is usually to a distinct person or entity for a very specific use. Also, I\u2019ve provided images for exclusive use before, but not for the broad description that has been provided in the corporate contract I\u2019m now reviewing. Here are the primary concerns I have over the terms and there are questions that I feel need to be brought up with this corporate entity before I can fulfill their request:\n\n1. I am the copyright holder of the images and owner of the images, though I still need to ensure the images will not violate the rights of any third party. Since all of the images to be licensed were created at public events I do not have model releases, even for stage performers. The chosen images do (or will) have crowd faces blurred as the people are not the sole subject, the ambiance of the event is what\u2019s being used. I feel I may have to decline the performer images unless I can get a release from them if I can track down a contact. Is there anything I\u2019m missing in this scenario that would pose a problem? I feel there is enough precedence regarding \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d and the voluntary presence at a public event that puts participants in a position of implicitly giving consent by their attendance.\n2. The requesting entity is asking for an \u201cunlimited, perpetual, exclusive, irrevocable worldwide license to distribute, publicly display, alter, edit, retouch and create derivative works\u201d. For the most part I don\u2019t have an issue with this\u2014the images are not on their own of any monetary value beyond what was already paid to capture them. Aside from my own portfolio, the contract does state that I cannot license the works to any other parties. However, there are a few which have already been licensed by other (or original) entities or I consider released as public domain (meaning enough people have stolen one image that I don\u2019t have the time or energy to go after compensation). Does prior licensing exclude me from granting an exclusive license going forward\u2014or should I simply inform the requesting entity and have them make the determination of whether they wish to proceed with certain images?\n3. The requesting entity intends to use the images for marketing and advertising purposes in digital and print media, and/or prints for framed photographs. There used to be a pricing calculator on Getty\u2019s website, but they seem to have caught on to folks using it for free and now it just prompts you to call them for more info. How does one determine a fair and reasonable licensing price for mixed distribution when the usage seems open-ended? Should I just invest in some more trustworthy software to help get me in a ballpark range?\n\nSo my main concerns are fair pricing and obtaining releases.

This was after spending months trying to find a bag that would fit my needs. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a good camera bag. (Looks at Peter McKinnon\u2019s Nomadic bag longingly). But I wasn\u2019t finding a bag that fit my needs. So I kept looking. Until I found that I didn\u2019t need a camera bag at all.\n\nThis journey began back in August of 2019. After taking my first photograph trip to Northern California I knew that I needed a bigger bag. After shedding my extra layers while hiking up a mountain when it warmed up, my bag was stuffed to the gills! No way would I be able to do a longer hike that required me to carry more food or water.\n\nSo began the search for my next camera bag. I looked at all the major brands and watched every camera bag video I came across. Some of them multiple times. One could say I was a little obsessed. As I did my research, I fleshed out what I was looking for in a bag until I realized that I might need more than one bag to fit my needs. This realization came when I decided that I wanted to get back into backpacking and take my camera with me too. I started to look at bag systems like the Shimoda Action X line and the F-stop Mountain Series bags. One of the big selling points for these two systems was their modular nature. I could purchase a larger bag for backpacking, a smaller bag for day hikes and traveling, and one inner camera unit. Then I could switch between them depending on what I needed at the time. Not to mention I could remove the camera unit if I was forced to gate check my bag.\n\nThat all changed when I found an article on backpacking with camera gear that talked about using a camera insert instead of a camera bag. I had heard of camera inserts before, but I had never given them much thought. So, after a lot of research I pulled the trigger and ordered one.\n\nWhich insert did I go with? The Tenba BYOB 10. I originally ordered the Tenba BYOB 9 but found that it wouldn\u2019t fit my camera (Canon RP with a Canon RF 24-105 f/4) and had to get the 10 instead. That said, it still fits inside the small messenger bag I have for when I want to take it out around town or to a local event. When it came time to buy a hiking/travelling backpack I took it with me to my local REI to make sure it would fit inside whatever bag I wanted. After trying on several bags I saw the REI Trail 40 and my curiosity was peaked. What makes this bag different is that it has a quad zipper design with a large U-shaped opening. That\u2019s right, four zippers! This allows you to leave two zippers at the top and one at the bottom of each side. Now you can get in your bag from both sides as well as the top. I currently have the camera insert positioned so that I can open the bag from the side and not have to dig through everything on top of the bag if I need to change lenses or grab a filter.\n\nIs a camera insert right for you? You will have to be the one to figure that out. If you\u2019re like me and travel light it might just work for you. Now I may pick up another camera bag in the future, but for now I\u2019m happy that I ditched my camera bag.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ksdp4q/why_i_ditched_my_camera_bag/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "positioned", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "why i ditched my camera bag /!/ recently i ditched my camera bag and switched to a camera insert. this was after spending months trying to find a bag that would fit my needs. don\u2019t get me wrong i love a good camera bag.

I\u2019m a veterinary nurse full time and only take my photo gear out for personal trips. \nI was working at a clinic for awhile and I overheard the owner and office manager complain that they couldn\u2019t find a photographer to take staff photos for them. I offered myself since I had background with doing it before. They seemed happy with the idea and I asked them if they wanted to see my old portfolio which they declined. I asked them what sort of photos they wanted and they said indoor photos against a brick wall. I said I could do that but I did better with ambient light and not studio because I don\u2019t have all the gear for it. They said it was fine. I\u2019d also charge time per shoot at one rate and time for \u201cediting\u201d (sifting through all the photos, editing out blemishes, adjusting light) at another. Again, all good. \nI take the photos of about 18 staff with their pets in a room with only a south facing window and a box light. Room is maybe 13x18 or so. \nA good handful of the photos came out blurry due to the low light and constant movement with dogs and cats, especially for those that had their shoot later in the day.

I started texting them about stopping by for the remaining balance and every time they said they were too busy. Finally i asked them to send it to me. \nThey said they didn\u2019t think the photos or edits are usable and they wouldn\u2019t be paying the balance left.

And I would go one step beyond and even claim that it is soon going to die.\n\nLet me explain my point of view and why I believe so. I will start with some trivial reasons and then move on the main reason in the latter half of this discussion post. \n\nFirst of all I am really worried with the advancement in camera technology happening these days and it getting cheaper and more accessible every day. There are so many hobbyist (like me) that are coming up due to this and they like to take their pictures themselves. They don't need a lot of fancy gear and can get what they want even from their smartphones and software techniques without much pain. There are already cameras in smartphones that can open up to f/1.4 (Vivo X60 pro) giving tremendous low light performance for example. So be it, but the most worrisome part is that they are ready to sell their pictures (again like me) for peanuts. I for example sell my photos for less than a dollar per picture. May be this doesn't pose a lot of threat to professionals but keep up with me.\n\nNext issue that I would like to point out is that of websites like unsplash and pexels. People including some top notch photographers post their pictures here for free. Individuals and more importantly major companies/industries now have an access to large amount of stock photos for free! I myself was shocked to see my photos reaching far and wide to websites like Buzzfeed, WordPress, Flickr etc and I gained nothing in return apart from come graphs and stats showing my reach, views and downloads.\n\nAll these things are eating up the photography market from inside out like a parasite I believe. But as if this was not enough, let me introduce you to GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). So far you might be wondering that there is still scope for specialization in fields like weddings, fashion, product, food, landscape, wildlife, portraits etc. If so, then I request you to kindly read further into this discussion.\n\nGANs are a deep learning based set of algorithm that can literally do magic. They will change the dynamics completely. **Photos will soon be created** (not taken). Once trained against a large set of database (which is available for free as mentioned before), they can make new photos. restore old photos, include what you want in a scene (like yourself), replace something that you want in a scene and what not!\n\nSome applications already available are:\n\n* Generation of random realistic portraits/models completely wiping out fashion photography.\n* Generation of cartoon characters, wiping out graphics/vector designers.\n* Image to image translation. (restoring old photos as high definition new photos, black and white to color images, sketches to realistic images)\n* Text to image translation. wiping out landscape/wildlife photography. (literally converting text like, \"A small Indian ringneck sitting on a branch\" into multiple image choices.)\n* Face repositioning and regeneration. (generate/reorient a face into required position)\n\nGANs are no joke. The results are already staggering. You must have seen deepfake challenges inviting you to find the difference between fake and original images.\n\n I would like to know your thoughts on it.

No, we are not the most logical bunch), few offerings have been as intriguing as the Chinese \"Summiluxes\" from TTArtisan. They promise impressive build quality at a seemingly impossible budget, with optical quality that allegedly edges in on Leica glass. I received my copy of the lens about a week ago and was floored with the high-quality feel of the lens. Its all-metal construction, focus dampening, and precise aperture ring genuinely felt more impressive than my Voigtlander lenses. I won't spend too much time praising the optical quality of this lens. Many have done so in a more professional fashion than I care to attempt. I am a hobbyist, not a pixel peeper. If you want the nitty-gritty, Benj Haisch and Ken Rockwell both go into detail about the optical strengths and shortcomings of this inexpensive Summilux clone. What I will say is that it's good. Very good. Not \"very good for a $369 lens.\" Just very good, period. \n\n[TTArtisan 50mm f1.4 ASPH in box](https://preview.redd.it/49tuvby16nm61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b65fefc3217e59e8431c26be6aca721ff0961cd)\n\nHowever, I was not able to keep my first copy of this lens. Purchased new from B&amp;H, it was not until after I finished the calibration process (a royal pain on film bodies like my M7) that I noticed something odd happening in the rangefinder. This lens was pulling up the correct 50mm frame lines, that was true, but it was simultaneously pulling up a second pair of frame lines. I was met with lines for 50mm, 75mm, and partial lines for 35mm and 135mm. Of course, the lens was still usable, but this is a pretty basic thing for an M Mount lens to be expected to accomplish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Calibrating on a film body... A test in patience](https://preview.redd.it/nu0hivv86nm61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b38beb3963839679c53ed391f827135b32954a5)\n\nThe culprit? I can't say for certain. My best guess is that the lens mount is not made to the same standards as more expensive glass, which comes as no surprise, but it was made so sloppily that it was not able to correctly interact with the frame line mechanism in the camera body. What I do know is that the issue is not with my camera body, as I have tried 3 other 50mm lenses (one being a Canon 1.8 LTM with a cheap adapter) that pulled up the correct frame lines without issue.\n\n[Extra frame lines](https://preview.redd.it/ym51maeg6nm61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1858d6f9ba48bdbcc8ec340b5103402519aa92cb)\n\nTo B&amp;H's credit, they took care of it without question and I received my new copy of the lens today... which has the same issue. This time I get a sliver of the 35mm frame line on the left side of the viewfinder, so it's less extreme than last time around. Is it enough of an issue to warrant sending it back a second time? I can't yet say. I'll have to spend some time shooting with it to see how distracting this issue is, and it appears that I might be able to remedy the issue by over-rotating the lens with the lock disengaged (past the locking pin, triggering 28mm/90mm frame lines) and rotating it back to its proper position. A ridiculous mounting process for a brand new lens, but hey... it's still a $369 50mm f1.4 for M mount. I might be willing to put up with some issues for the performance per dollar. That, and it works perfectly on my Sony A7iii.\n\n[Attempt number two on my Leica M7. Better, but not perfect.](https://preview.redd.it/73u91efy6nm61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f644deb99611d7e684252d5ed70eb8cd4304f2)\n\nAll this to say, take the overwhelmingly positive reviews about this lens with a grain of salt. I have no doubt that the reviewers of this lens have been honest in their writings, but I also know that many reviewers have received their copies of these lenses from TTA for the purpose of reviewing. I would not be surprised if review units were given a second once-over before being put in the mail, and I  think there may be some manufacturing inconsistencies present with these TTArtisan lenses. Perhaps you will have better luck than I have. Perhaps I will exchange it again and try my luck a third time. Perhaps I'll just send it back and buy a used Zeiss 50mm F2. Time will tell, but your mileage may vary. The bottom line remains, it's an optically fantastic lens and has no issues on a mirrorless camera. But on an M mount system, where it was intended to be used, two brand new lenses shouldn't have this type of issue. \n\n*Processing img g5nxf3b38nm61...*", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/m3oc95/initial_thoughts_on_ttartisan_50mm_f14_asph_for/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "initial thoughts on ttartisan 50mm f1.4 asph for leica m mount /!/ for the leica shooter on a budget (yes, we exist. no, we are not the most logical bunch), few offerings have been as intriguing as the chinese \"summiluxes\" from ttartisan. they promise impressive build quality at a seemingly impossible budget, with optical quality that allegedly edges in on leica glass. i received my copy of the lens about a week ago and was floored with the high-quality feel of the lens. its all-metal construction, focus dampening, and precise aperture ring genuinely felt more impressive than my voigtlander lenses. i won't spend too much time praising the optical quality of this lens. many have done so in a more professional fashion than i care to attempt. i am a hobbyist, not a pixel peeper. if you want the nitty-gritty, benj haisch and ken rockwell both go into detail about the optical strengths and shortcomings of this inexpensive summilux clone. what i will say is that it's good. very good. not \"very good for a $369 lens.\" just very good, period. \n\n[ttartisan 50mm f1.4 asph in box](https://preview.redd.it/49tuvby16nm61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b65fefc3217e59e8431c26be6aca721ff0961cd)\n\nhowever, i was not able to keep my first copy of this lens. purchased new from b&amp;h, it was not until after i finished the calibration process (a royal pain on film bodies like my m7) that i noticed something odd happening in the rangefinder. this lens was pulling up the correct 50mm frame lines, that was true, but it was simultaneously pulling up a second pair of frame lines. i was met with lines for 50mm, 75mm, and partial lines for 35mm and 135mm. of course, the lens was still usable, but this is a pretty basic thing for an m mount lens to be expected to accomplish. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[calibrating on a film body... a test in patience](https://preview.redd.it/nu0hivv86nm61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b38beb3963839679c53ed391f827135b32954a5)\n\nthe culprit? i can't say for certain. my best guess is that the lens mount is not made to the same standards as more expensive glass, which comes as no surprise, but it was made so sloppily that it was not able to correctly interact with the frame line mechanism in the camera body. what i do know is that the issue is not with my camera body, as i have tried 3 other 50mm lenses (one being a canon 1.8 ltm with a cheap adapter) that pulled up the correct frame lines without issue.\n\n[extra frame lines](https://preview.redd.it/ym51maeg6nm61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1858d6f9ba48bdbcc8ec340b5103402519aa92cb)\n\nto b&amp;h's credit, they took care of it without question and i received my new copy of the lens today... which has the same issue. this time i get a sliver of the 35mm frame line on the left side of the viewfinder, so it's less extreme than last time around. is it enough of an issue to warrant sending it back a second time? i can't yet say. i'll have to spend some time shooting with it to see how distracting this issue is, and it appears that i might be able to remedy the issue by over-rotating the lens with the lock disengaged (past the locking pin, triggering 28mm/90mm frame lines) and rotating it back to its proper -----> position !!! . a ridiculous mounting process for a brand new lens, but hey... it's still a $369 50mm f1.4 for m mount. i might be willing to put up with some issues for the performance per dollar. that, and it works perfectly on my sony a7iii.\n\n[attempt number two on my leica m7. better, but not perfect.](https://preview.redd.it/73u91efy6nm61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f644deb99611d7e684252d5ed70eb8cd4304f2)\n\nall this to say, take the overwhelmingly positive reviews about this lens with a grain of salt. i have no doubt that the reviewers of this lens have been honest in their writings, but i also know that many reviewers have received their copies of these lenses from tta for the purpose of reviewing. i would not be surprised if review units were given a second once-over before being put in the mail, and i  think there may be some manufacturing inconsistencies present with these ttartisan lenses. perhaps you will have better luck than i have. perhaps i will exchange it again and try my luck a third time. perhaps i'll just send it back and buy a used zeiss 50mm f2. time will tell, but your mileage may vary. the bottom line remains, it's an optically fantastic lens and has no issues on a mirrorless camera. but on an m mount system, where it was intended to be used, two brand new lenses shouldn't have this type of issue. \n\n*processing img g5nxf3b38nm61...*", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 12855, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 122861, "autor": "willumasaurus", "date": 1619252157000, "content": "Need kit help /!/ I am a professional photographer and videographer that has recently left a full time salaried position to go it on my own.

Most of my jobs/clients are for different types of portrait work. As I'm sure you other photographers working in portraiture know, there are a lot of different styles and looks even within just the portrait field, so of course the first thing I do when a client approaches or hires me is that I try to figure out what they would like to have done so that I can figure out how best to give it to them (or if I'm even the right photographer for the shoot in the first place). But something that can often happen is that the client is very vague about what it is they want, to the point where I honestly only have the slightest clue. \n\nCase in point, a very recent example...\n\nA woman hires me for a portrait shoot, saying she would like photos for her dating site profiles and social media. Under \"additional details\" she puts that she would like a \"fun vibe\".\n\nCondensed version of our conversation: \n\nMe: Hi Client, Thanks for booking a shoot!
