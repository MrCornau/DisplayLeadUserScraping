My greatest inspiration is my sister who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.\n\nYou just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity.

Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.\u00a0 My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush.\n\nThe strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps &amp; is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.\n\nOther than drawing, I like reading whether it is newspaper, news, novels, G K book or any knowledgeable book written by any good author. I always read story books, newspaper, magazines, and any other material that I find interesting in my free time.

As we enter a new generation of gaming, we see a future where you\u2019re instantly absorbed in your games \u2013 where worlds are even more lifelike, immersive, responsive and surprising \u2013 and where you are at the center of your gaming experience. With the new Xbox Series X, we will realize that vision.\u00a0\n\nXbox Series X will be our fastest, most powerful console ever and set a new bar for performance, speed, and compatibility, allowing you to bring your gaming legacy, thousands of games from three generations and more forward with you. Its industrial design enables us to deliver four times the processing power of Xbox One X in the quietest and efficient way, something that is critically important in delivering truly immersive gameplay. We also designed Xbox Series X to support both vertical and horizontal orientation. It\u2019s bold and unique, very much like our fans around the world and the team of collaborators and innovators who built it.\n\nThe name Xbox is an expression of our deep history in gaming, our team\u2019s unrelenting passion, and our commitment to both our fans and the future of gaming at Microsoft.

Its size and shape have been refined to accommodate an even wider range of people, and it also features a new Share button to make capturing screenshots and game clips simple and a hybrid d-pad inspired by the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2.

With Xbox Series X, we will elevate the way games look, play and feel. We will also remove the technical barriers faced in previous generations and enable developers to create more expansive, immersive gaming worlds that invite more players to play.\u00a0\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, this will manifest as world-class visuals in 4K at 60FPS, with the possibility of up to 120FPS, including support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and 8K capability.

There\u2019s a light diffuser dome, two light sensors (one for low and one for high light), and a 4-digit 7-segment display which displays the EV level when a button is pushed. The benefit of such a basic system is yearlong battery life and easy operation, but converting EV to shutter speed/aperture takes around half a minute and is generally inconvenient, although the unit cost per device is ~$7 which is very low compared to something like a Sekonic meter.
