Then you should know your value chain /!/ Hello everyone!\n\nI am writing this because I see a lot of people asking the same questions over and over and thought it would be nice to give you all the tools to answer your own questions. Or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. Why should you listen to me? With the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; I am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. I am not claiming I am the smartest person in the world, but I do feel confident in what I am saying here.\n\nThe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. In fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions I have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nThe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. A value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nFor example: If I am running a lemonade stand, I buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. If that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know I am creating ($200-$100)/(1+3+1) = $20/hour. We also know how much value each step creates. If I wanted to hire a buddy to set up the stand, then we know that unless they are priced at below $20 its not worth it. If I want to make my little brother run the stand, then unless they are priced at below $60, its not worth it.\n\nWhy does this apply to photography? Because like any business making the \"lemonade\" is just one step in the process. You also need to do: business functions, like billing, marketing functions like advertising, process functions like editing, and other small things like transportation. People forget these, or under estimate them, and it will ruin your profit margin.\n\nLets look at some example of how you can apply this to your every day.\n\nExample 1: a friend is asking you to shoot their product/event/person/dog, how much should your friends and family discount be?\n\nMany people do not realize this, but there is actually a business case to give a friends and family discount. When you look at your value chain, look at all the steps you do not need to do because they are a friend. You don't need to advertise, because they came to you. You don't need to network because you were already friends. Your communication time is less because you can get some of the details worked out when you normally hang out with them. Lets say you normally charge $900 for a specific job, and you add up all of these savings and it is $300. If you are struggling to get clients, then you can offer them the job for $600, which saves them $300 and gets you profit you would not have gotten otherwise. If you are packed full time with clients, you can offer them the job for $750, saving them $150, and earning you $150 more than you would normally earn since you saved all these costs.\n\nIn either case having your value chain, and knowing what your needs are (more clients, more money, etc.) lets you make a financially sound decision when offering a discount. More importantly it is a win-win situation as both of you are better off had you not made the deal.\n\nExample 2: You hear about this new app that will help you get clients, should you join?\n\nSimilar to the lemonade stand example, except it is slightly reversed, instead of hiring someone and setting the financial boundaries, you are being hired and the boundaries are set for you. Once again your value chain can come to your rescue and help you decide. Now I am going to assume anyone considering this type of gig is new to the business, as they always are in my experience. What you first need to do is quickly think about any red flags from your value chain perspective. In previous jobs, how much time was spent getting the client vs shooting/editing? If networking is 70% of your time, then when you outsource that task you are outsourcing 70% of the profits.\n\nAs a new shooter you may think that 70% is an absurd number but a quick google search of how long pros spend actually shooting will validate it.\n\nhttps://www.thephoblographer.com/2015/07/30/how-professional-photographers-actually-spend-their-time/\n\nFrom this link you can see that most photographers spend ~15% of their time shooting an editing, with one spending as little as 6% of their time on it. So if the only thing you want to do is shoot/edit, then you will only see 15% of the profits. How does that app sound now? For most photographers (let alone new ones) you can expect a small restaurant to pay &lt;$400 for an average food shoot. This means if you work for an app on this gig, you can expect to get paid &lt;$60 for your work. Dividing that by the time to travel to the site, get set up, shoot the food, tear down, travel home, and edit for your hourly wage and you are probably netting &lt; $15/hour. Maybe that's worth it to you, maybe its not, but you at least have the information to make the decision yourself.\n\nSo how do you create a value chain?\n\nI know it might be tempting to steal the % off the link above, and while that is a good starting point it wont work. Your work is different and takes different efforts. Your clients are different and require more/less work. Your location is different and needs more/less time to get around. Most importantly you business model makes a huge difference, are you trying to sell prints? Are you trying to sell to individuals? Are you trying to get repeat customers? Make your own value chain.\n\nFor a small new photography business what you should probably do is\n\n1. List out every step you need to take for a profit. Include things like advertising, networking, doing your finances every month, harassing clients for payments.\n2. Record the time it will take at every step. If you don\u2019t know, ask some pros for advice, if everyone hates you, take your best estimate and adjust, but use this as a last resort.\n3. Come up with a reasonable hourly rate for each step. Think of it this way, dont ask what you want to be paid for each step, ask what you would be willing to pay per hour to have someone else do it. The reason is because this sets up your mind to think of these as the minimum costs, which is what you want.  \n4. Multiple your hours by hourly rate, and total up\n\nExample of a value chain:\n\nTask 1: recruiting clients. 20 hours per week. $10/hour. $200 total.  \nTask 2: shooting/editing. 3 jobs per week, 3 hours per job. $20/hour. $180 total.  \nTask 3: transportation. 3 jobs per week, 1 hour per job. $10/hour. $30 total.  \nTask 4: business operations (e.g. billing). 10 hours per week. $10/hour. $100 total.  \n\nWhat does this tell me?\n\n1. I will be expecting to work 42 hours a week\n2. I will be expecting to have $510 in \u201ccosts\u201d per week\n3. For 3 jobs I need them to pay at least $510/3 = $170 a job\n4. If I outsource client acquisition I lose $200/$510 = 40% of the potential profit\n5. If I find a client that does not require transportation (e.g. in my building) I can offer them a $30/$510 = 6% discount\n\n*Note that these are made up numbers with no real relation to the real world*\n\nKeep in mind that these are the breakeven points of everything. So I would not, for example, price a client at $170 because that would be \u201ccost plus pricing\u201d which is generally considered bad. Pricing is a whole different demon to tackle and would have to be its own post.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more from people much smarter than me, I would suggest starting with this HBS article. Do keep in mind, however, that Porter's more refined and detailed value chain analysis is meant for companies, with different departments. For 1-5 people working a super small business, its not really all that necessary to get that detailed, but it definitely wont hurt!\n\nhttps://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-value-chain-analysis", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/q2mqhp/want_to_earn_money_from_your_photography_then_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i am creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "want to earn money from your photography? then you should know your value chain /!/ hello everyone!\n\ni am writing this because i see a lot of people asking the same questions over and over and thought it would be nice to give you all the tools to answer your own questions. or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. why should you listen to me? with the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; i am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. i am not claiming i am the smartest person in the world, but i do feel confident in what i am saying here.\n\nthe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. in fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions i have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nthe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. a value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nfor example: if i am running a lemonade stand, i buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. if that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know -----> i !!!  -----> am !!!  -----> creating !!!

for most photographers (let alone new ones) you can expect a small restaurant to pay &lt;$400 for an average food shoot. this means if you work for an app on this gig, you can expect to get paid &lt;$60 for your work. dividing that by the time to travel to the site, get set up, shoot the food, tear down, travel home, and edit for your hourly wage and you are probably netting &lt; $15/hour. maybe that's worth it to you, maybe its not, but you at least have the information to make the decision yourself.\n\nso how do you create a value chain?\n\ni know it might be tempting to steal the % off the link above, and while that is a good starting point it wont work. your work is different and takes different efforts. your clients are different and require more/less work. your location is different and needs more/less time to get around. most importantly you business model makes a huge difference, are you trying to sell prints? are you trying to sell to individuals? are you trying to get repeat customers? make your own value chain.\n\nfor a small new photography business what you should probably do is\n\n1. list out every step you need to take for a profit. include things like advertising, networking, doing your finances every month, harassing clients for payments.\n2. record the time it will take at every step. if you don\u2019t know, ask some pros for advice, if everyone hates you, take your best estimate and adjust, but use this as a last resort.\n3. come up with a reasonable hourly rate for each step. think of it this way, dont ask what you want to be paid for each step, ask what you would be willing to pay per hour to have someone else do it. the reason is because this sets up your mind to think of these as the minimum costs, which is what you want.  \n4. multiple your hours by hourly rate, and total up\n\nexample of a value chain:\n\ntask 1: recruiting clients. 20 hours per week. $10/hour. $200 total.  \ntask 2: shooting/editing. 3 jobs per week, 3 hours per job. $20/hour. $180 total.  \ntask 3: transportation. 3 jobs per week, 1 hour per job. $10/hour. $30 total.  \ntask 4: business operations (e.g. billing). 10 hours per week. $10/hour. $100 total.  \n\nwhat does this tell me?\n\n1. i will be expecting to work 42 hours a week\n2. i will be expecting to have $510 in \u201ccosts\u201d per week\n3. for 3 jobs i need them to pay at least $510/3 = $170 a job\n4. if i outsource client acquisition i lose $200/$510 = 40% of the potential profit\n5. if i find a client that does not require transportation (e.g. in my building) i can offer them a $30/$510 = 6% discount\n\n*note that these are made up numbers with no real relation to the real world*\n\nkeep in mind that these are the breakeven points of everything. so i would not, for example, price a client at $170 because that would be \u201ccost plus pricing\u201d which is generally considered bad. pricing is a whole different demon to tackle and would have to be its own post.\n\nif you'd like to learn more from people much smarter than me, i would suggest starting with this hbs article. do keep in mind, however, that porter's more refined and detailed value chain analysis is meant for companies, with different departments. for 1-5 people working a super small business, its not really all that necessary to get that detailed, but it definitely wont hurt!\n\nhttps://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-value-chain-analysis", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 3345, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "ph_maneiro", "date": "2021-10-14 05:17:32", "content": "Is pinterest a good way to share my work?

I had posted on my local Facebook groups that I was offering free photo shoots to build my portfolio and last night I had my first one.   \n\n\nI was super nervous at first, but this couple wanted photos of their dogs taken on the beach so it wasn't like I was really \"directing\" anyone to pose, but trying to run around and take halfway decent photos of dogs that just wanted to play was a bit... awkward. I snapped around 100 photos, and 70 of them were passable. The couple and their dogs left after I was done, and I hung around the beach for awhile waiting for golden hour as I wanted to try some landscape photos. A woman who had watched me taking photos of the dogs came up to me and asked if I was a photographer. I nervously said I was, but was just in the beginning stages and trying to put a portfolio together. She seemed excited, and had a chill vibe about her so I asked her if I could take a few portrait photos of her during golden hour and she agreed. I spent an hour taking photos of her, neither one of use knew each other but it just came so natural, I was having fun directing her on how to pose against the sunlight and playing with my camera, figuring out how to make the lighting work with her skin/hair tone to get the best photos. I truly learned what a 50mm could do for portraits and I was in love with my camera and lens setup.  \nWe exchanged info and went on our separate ways, I was on a high like I couldn't believe. I went home and edited all the photos of the dogs and her in lightroom, and was amazed at how the photos came out.   \n\n\nIs this what it feels like to be a photographer?

My main purpose is documenting my hikes, which I used to do with my phone, but wanted an upgrade in image quality.\n\nWith the camera, my process for dealing with the pictures has changed quite a bit, and the effort has increased significantly. I also feel like my methods aren't exactly efficient, but I'm not sure what exactly I could improve. So I'd like to collect your preferred processes and learn from them.\n\nFor the record, these are my old and current processes, respectively:\n\n**Old Process (Phone)**\n\n1. Let MS Onedrive back up the pictures from my phone.\n\n2. Create an album for that day/hike/event from the camera reel.\n\n3. Delete the bad or unsuitable pictures from the album.\n\n4. Download the album to my computer and back it up locally.\n\n**New Process**\n\n1. Insert SD Card into card reader on PC.\n\n2. Look through pictures, deleting bad ones and rating really good ones as 4/5 stars within Windows Explorer. See step 4 for relevance of the latter.\n\n3. Be annoyed with Windows 10 because Windows 7 was better and more convenient at literally everything. Be salty about lost functionality like jumping to the file from the open photo, or being able to have the preview and details pane open simultaneously, as well as being able to rate the picture from the open photo without having to switch back to the folder and looking for the current image by name to be able to rate it.\n\n4. Sort by name, manually select the RAW files corresponding to the 4-5 star rated JPEGs, and send them over to a \"Source/RAW\" folder on the hard drive (No use in keeping the mediocre RAWs).\n\n5. Send the remaining JPEGs to the Source folder.\n\n6. At this point, I would use rawtherapee to create optimal PNGs from the RAW files, but I'm still learning how to make those not look shit, so instead at this point, I edit the JPEGs that could be good but need some adjustments.\n\n7. Create an Album folder for that Day/Hike/Event and copy (not move) all the pictures over.\n\n8. Delete the ones I don't want in the Album.\n\n9. Upload the album folder to Onedrive (web, not the windows folder. I hate how that one works) for backup / sharing among family and friends.\n\n10. Optionally copy individual pictures to different folders comprising various topical favorite images like \"of my wife\", \"of my pets\", etc.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nI'm currently wasting up to around 110% extra hard drive space by copying images into various themed folders. This is not an issue yet, but might become costly in the future.\n\nThe reason I do this is that I find it the easiest method to find the pictures later, it's the most convenient form of organization to my brain, shortcuts and tags wouldn't work for uploading, and I don't trust tags.\n\nWhen I say I don't trust tags, I mean I don't want to go through hours of effort tagging images by content only to find in ten years that my new operating system doesn't know what to do with the tags I created in Windows 10, for example. Themed folders full of copied files seem much more reliable.\n\nThe downside of copy pasting is that if I alter an image later on, be it in name or the image itself, I have to apply those changes everywhere else the image is saved as well.\n\nI think the biggest issue currently is how long steps 1-6 are taking me, and I'm almost sure there has to be a better way, perhaps 3rd party software assisted. \n\nI'd also like to waste less hard drive space, and have the images thematically filed but connected.\n\nI've considered having Onedrive (web) as my canonical filing space and using their tags and albums instead of copying files, as that resolves all my issues except the futureproofing aspect (I'd hate to have to reorganize tens of thousands of pictures the day I stop using Onedrive.)\n\n**What do you do yourself?

I often shoot with a lens that only covers 46 degrees field of view, shooting locked-off on a tripod panoramically with 1/3 frame overlap allows me to create images that are 110 degrees field of view.
