I find that photography is lacking this aspect which for me seems to be critical.\n\nFor example, with conventional jobs, it's straight-forward. Go to school, work hard, and you get rewarded with good grades and a job offer. Then you're further rewarded with a guaranteed salary, praise for your good work, promotions, etc. You have a manager and a team who will support you (ideally). I mean, this all can vary wildly, but in my experience this was mostly the case. It's like playing an MMORPG in real life -- there are straight-forward quests and a clear progression for you to follow.\n\nThen you have less conventional fields. I was a musician for a while, and that was certainly more difficult, but there was so much positive reinforcement. First of all, your bandmates will tell you when your ideas are actually good, and help keep things going when you feel down. Second, when you play a show and people visibly appreciate your music and tell you how great it was, it feels incredible. Third, putting your work out there yields results. Things like reviews, articles, radio airplay, etc just sort of happened naturally. It's a saturated field, for sure, but not as saturated as photography -- I think it takes more work to produce something that people are willing to take a listen to. There's really not \\*that\\* much original, high quality work in my opinion.\n\nThen you have photography. There's no team or band -- you're on your own. So, when you lack confidence in your ability, no one will support you. You put your work out there, but even a 97-98 pulse on 500px will only get you 5 new followers. The same images will do very little on instagram unless they get featured, which might yield 20 followers. (Just my experience, purely anecdotal.) But, even great images easily disappear into the void unnoticed since the field is so saturated, so let's say only one out of every 4 images gets featured somewhere (unlikely). So, you can create 100 professional quality images and end up with 100 \\* 5 = 500 followers on 500px, and 100 / 4 \\* 20 = 500 followers on instagram.\n\nThat's certainly a start, but there are people with images that are unoriginal and bad to mediocre in quality, and 5 figure followings. Their work will rank higher than yours no matter how good your images are. **And maybe that's fine if you can somehow know that your work is good, social media is perhaps a bad metric for quality, but after a while, how do you know? Maybe it's actually bad and you're just just delusional? Maybe you're just not a real artist? Maybe the reason for your lack of following is that you just suck and no one has the heart to tell you?** That's how I feel when I don't have any validation, at least. I'm sure some of you feel the same.\n\nNow, I don't think I have 100 professional level images yet, I have maybe 10. I consider most of my work utter garbage and have a long way to go. But, to even get to this point it took many years. The amount of work needed to crate one high quality image is super high, and even once you're good it takes time. I remember Thomas Heaton mentioning he gets maybe 1 \"keeper\" per month even while doing it full time. So, at the rate I'm going, I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel here.\n\n(That light being some strong positive response that will encourage you to keep going)\n\nOf course, it's about the journey, and I would find it very hard to not do photography. I really love it. But seeing my work getting nowhere while I had achieved success with much greater ease in other fields is demoralizing and makes me doubt my abilities, which in turn makes me enjoy it less and just wonder if my time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nUltimately I want to add value to the world, not just spend my time doing stuff I enjoy. Otherwise I'd just be playing videogames or hiking all day, but, I find creating something people appreciate to be more fulfilling. A common advice is to take a break from photography and see if inspiration returns. I've done that. The inspiration is there. The self-doubt, however, is stronger.\n\n**How do others deal with it?**\n\nOne idea I've had is forming a \"study group\" with like-minded photographers of a similar level to help each other improve and grow, as Mads Peter Iversen suggested in a recent video. I probably need to make that happen soon. Also, maybe I'm just getting extra sad lately from not being able to get out into the mountains due to the quarantine. This is the longest I haven't hiked in 4 years.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!

It contained all the Fujifilm \"film simulations\" that us Fujifilm camera users have all come to know and love, but it gained an extra effect: the **Color Chrome effect**.\n\nThis effect was inspired by Fujifilm's own FUJICHROME Fortia SP film, which promised even greater contrast and colours in comparison to the world-famous Velvia 50.\n\nQuoting from Fujifilm-X:\n\n&gt;Usually, when photographing colors such as red, orange, or green under high-contrast conditions, it\u2019s easy for an RGB color channel to become overloaded \u2013 as if individually too bright. Under these conditions \u2013 with contrast and brightness at a maximum \u2013 there is no room for a full range of tones and the scene tends to look a bit flat. But with Color Chrome switched on, subtle differences of tone can be detected and enhanced. The result is a punchy, high saturation image that doesn\u2019t lose its impact and depth.\n\nThis Color Chrome effect was later ported to newer Fujifilm-X cameras, such as the Fujifilm X-T3 and the X-T30. Unfortunately, us older Fujifilm-X users (I have a Fujifilm X-T2) may never see this effect on their camera. \n\nSo I've resolved to try and recreate it, which is pretty easy to do in Affinity Photo.\n\n[https://www.iancylkowski.com/blog/2020/7/4/fujifilm-color-chrome-effect-how-to-recreate-in-affinity-photo](https://www.iancylkowski.com/blog/2020/7/4/fujifilm-color-chrome-effect-how-to-recreate-in-affinity-photo)\n\nThe tutorial utilises Affinity Photo's LAB colour mode in the Curves Adjustment tool, which is so, so handy.
