(TL;DR at the end)\n\nI\u2019m CC and I started getting more into photography at the beginning of this year. I\u2019ve loved photography since the time my dad and brother got into it when I was younger, but it was not nearly as accessible at the time due to the cost of film and development, as well as the fear of making mistakes in a medium when I was never really as serious about photography as my aforementioned family were. \n\nHowever, I recently made a super cheap plunge into photography. I bought a Yi M1 in january, as I very quickly purchased a panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens for it, which has basically replaced the kit lens for everything. \n\nWith the camera, I also opened up a Flickr account where I upload what I consider my best work.

Should I upload my photos with full copyright? Will my current scheme of uploading photos hinder my ability to sell those photos in the future?
