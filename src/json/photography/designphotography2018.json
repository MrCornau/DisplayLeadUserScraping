I'm not going to college and i don't plan to. I currently focus on fashion work but I do lifestyle work, food, event, etc. I'm also a graphic designer. My design portfolio isn't as consistent as my photo one but I've been in the field for about 5 years, so I think it's fair to give myself the title. My currently goals are to get my work published in a fashion magazine (Schon, Dazed, 032c, so on) and host a solo exhibition by next Summer. Long term goal - I want to be creative/art director of a major publication.\n\nMy problem is money. I've been applying to photography/design jobs for the last two months and I'll either get no response or rejected. I'll even follow up on the phone and most of the time some receptionist tells me the person I want to be speaking to is \"in a meeting\". Id like to keep working toward my goals but its frustrating to not even have enough money to pay for my car insurance. I try to promote my own photography services but I get no inquiries. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. This industry seems like it's built by and for extroverts and I'm just not that loud. I don't want to get a job at some restaurant or store but it seems like that's what's going to end up happening.\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar position?
