How do I change this? /!/ I started photography about 6 months back and bought a Mirrorless camera about 4 months back. Initially started with street and landscape and after doing it for 3 or a bit more months I started doing portraits for a number of reasons. I feel I like it much more (the story may be a post in itself and not really relevant to the discussion) and would like to get really good in this field (I know it must take a lot of time). I must say that I have a day job so photography isn't something I depend on for money and that is why I think I have full freedom to explore this area without caring about the monetary side of things.\n\nSo far I am just taking pics of pretty girls. And without sounding cheesy, cliched or a pervert I would say that my idea is to capture female beauty since it really fascinates me. Some photographers that inspire me are Dubnistkiy, Ana Dias, Haris Nukem. \n\nAfter shooting portraits for about 2 months (all outdoor shoots in my city) I feel like every shoot of mine is now getting repetitive. Repetitive in the sense that I end up having less and less variety in my pics with each shoot. I especially realized this in the last shoot when I was just standing not sure of what to do. Moreover, I feel that I am unable to come up with something unique and my pics end up looking like so many others on Instagram. I have posted my pics on other subreddits (with a different account) here and some have got a lot of appreciation so I don't think I am necessarily taking bad pics. \n\nBut I feel that I am not able to come up with something unique or develop a style. Constrained by my sorroundings I am also not able to do lots of things that I would like to do. For example, I live in a big city so my themes so far have been all urban in nature. There are some parks here but parks seem artificial and I would like shooting in more natural locations say a farm, near the sea or something else. When I travel I would do those things but at the moment what I am unable to fix is a lack of creativity.\n\nI don't want to just be a guy with a camera who is taking pics of pretty girls since so many are doing that. I would really like to be good at this and develop a style and inspire others since I feel I have the resources and time and money to fully follow my passion. But I am not sure what to do next. Right now my photography gear consists of a Mirrorless camera and a prime lens 85mm F1.8 (and 2 kit lenses which I don't use now).\n\nSo what should I do next?\n\n1. Buy more gear? Like lighting equipment etc? \n2. Try to come up with new ideas? If yes then how? Travelling to new locations? Looking at the works of more photographers? Or something else.\n3. Spend time trying to build a style. I am not sure if I can choose it, maybe it would develop with time.\n4. Or just keep shooting and try to get better. I will keep shooting but at the same time, I want to improve at a faster rate and to escape this creative block.\n\nWould really appreciate any advice.

In total there are 12 restaurants and I have to take pictures of each one and post them on IG and FB. Who was previously in charge of this did not give me any pictures to begin with to post while I take new ones, so I start from scratch.\n\nI have to say I am not a professional photographer. I am an amateur with a Canon EOS 550D and a 50mm lens. This makes it especially difficult to photograph interiors. Also, due to short winter daylight times, the restaurant opening times, and school I have only a 1-2 hour margin to take pictures of the restaurants. I do not have any lighting equipment which renders me basically useless once natural light is gone. Not to mention choosing the photos, editing them, coming up with captions and all that blabla SoMe stuff.\n\nSo, my boss complained that I cannot take pictures fast enough, does not provide me with any equipment and already threatened to fire me and/or cut my salary in half (which is also not so good since they give me nothing to work with). I have been able to come up with pictures for 4 restaurants only in 2 weeks and has been exhausting me.

I noticed an issue with it recently on my vacation and realized this issue has been present the entire time I've had it, I just didn't notice. I have an image from the first time I shot with the camera that shows this issue. Turns out there have been three separate recalls for this exact issue, but my serial number was not one of the ones recalled. I contacted them asking if they could do the repair free of charge considering they have repaired thousands of them already for this exact issue free of charge. They told me that because my serial number wasn't affected, I would have to pay. \n\nI called their support team and asked for a manager to talk to see if I could get somewhere with them. After a conversation they gave me a prepaid label for the repair center and told me to send them the repair invoice number once it arrives and they would see what they could do. Great! Finally getting somewhere. \n\nThe camera arrives and I sent the manager the number. Then for the past three weeks I have been arguing back and forth about this. They would give me something along the lines of \"well this photo is shot with a Zeiss lens, so we can't do anything about it\". So I sent them an image taken with a Nikon lens that showed the same issue. They responded with \"the JPEG is doesn't have enough Metadata for us\" so I sent three .NEF files all shot with Nikon lenses showing the issue. They responded \"we don't see any issues\" so I sent crops that clearly show the issue to which they respond \"the image is too low quality\". They insisted that there hasn't been any service advisories for this despite they fact that their own website says it and there are countless articles online about it. Every time I sent something they made an excuse, and then when I countered that, they came up with a new excuse. \n\nSo I just authorized a payment of $316 for a camera that has a manufacturing defect that has been widely reported and repaired for free thousands of times.

I have always dreamed of being a professional filmmaker or photographer, and I am passionate about e-commerce, now that I am hiring other developers I feel like it's the right opportunity.\n\nI would like to offer the following:\n- Product photography\n- Product GIFs\n- 360 images\n- 3D product renderings for AR (when browser support picks up)\n\nGood product images &amp; interactive experiences increases conversion.

Would take a couple hours to shoot images, edit, create 360, edit video, source backdrops &amp; props, etc. And I would need to include the price of shipping/returns, purchasing props, hiring model, etc.\n\nOf course, that Price Per Product could be reduced if I did an entire collection, since I could develop a workflow and could use similar props/models/edits. But still, $300-500 per product, that would mean $3,000-$5,000 per collection (~10 products).\n\nWould people be willing to pay that? Might be a harder sell than I considered?

I was a bit disappointed.\n\nLandscapes seemed quite good but maybe a little fake. \n\nIt was set up strangely to start and automatically has face softener on which makes you look like you've got make up on.... turned that off as soon as I realised.\n\nBut what should I do about HDR?\nIt is set automatically to be on all the time which is how I kept it. I am not actually sure what this setting is for however. Does it mean you are getting a more realistic photo because it is high definition or is it a really manipulating a picture using software? \nPictures and selfies of  people seemed far less flattering than my actual camera as blemishes, lines and wrinkles seem really pronounced and they make the subjects look older and more haggered. \n\nIs this showing a truer representation of the subject or is HDR enhancing the flaws?\n\nI would have thought my canon G7 X II would be a good representation of reality but people's features seem softer and less obvious on that. \n\nWhich is the truer picture?\n\nAnd lastly, would you keep HDR on for most landscape and subject pictures or turn it off?\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/de29ks/using_phone_camera_instead_of_g7_x_ii_advice_do_i/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "using phone camera instead of g7 x ii advice - do i keep hdr setting on all the time etc? which is more realistic? /!/ hi all, i'm by no means a decent photographer but i enjoy using my canon g7 x ii and have learnt the basics enough to -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  some ok pictures.\n\ni have never had a decent smartphone and my friends kept bugging me to stop carrying around my camera and buy a good camera phone as they claimed they are \"just as good, if not better\".\n\ni took their advice and got a pixel 3 which i just took away with me on holiday. i tried to use only the phone as a tester and to see how happy i'd be with the results. i was a bit disappointed.\n\nlandscapes seemed quite good but maybe a little fake. \n\nit was set up strangely to start and automatically has face softener on which makes you look like you've got make up on.... turned that off as soon as i realised.\n\nbut what should i do about hdr?\nit is set automatically to be on all the time which is how i kept it. i am not actually sure what this setting is for however. does it mean you are getting a more realistic photo because it is high definition or is it a really manipulating a picture using software? \npictures and selfies of  people seemed far less flattering than my actual camera as blemishes, lines and wrinkles seem really pronounced and they make the subjects look older and more haggered. \n\nis this showing a truer representation of the subject or is hdr enhancing the flaws?\n\ni would have thought my canon g7 x ii would be a good representation of reality but people's features seem softer and less obvious on that. \n\nwhich is the truer picture?\n\nand lastly, would you keep hdr on for most landscape and subject pictures or turn it off?\n\nthanks!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 76605, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "mrskebs", "date": "2019-08-17 14:51:56", "content": "Photographer ruined my memories of my wedding with these pictures /!/ These are the pictures that I waited anxiously for a month to receive.

It was an Olympus E-400, and I thought it was a bargain. I was drawn to this camera initially because of the letter E which I thought of as *Equality,* but you might think of *Excellent* and that would be a good guess. The 400 also piqued my interest because it is of course a square number, very prevalent in the photograph theory involving squares. But enough about me.\n\nThe guy who sold it to me was old and scary like a demon with a beard, and when he breathed in, it caused a vacuum in the air as if he had sucked up all of the Earth's atmosphere - the exact kind of guy you expect to meet at a local fair. He said he didn't want any of my money for the camera; he just asked me to take a photo for him some time and made me promise him. Seems easy enough. What's the catch, I thought? \n\nAnd then I forgot all about this demon man with vacuum breath of fire for eyes. I was really excited because photographs are sort of art in a way, and if you shake the camera a bit, the images can even look like a real painting.\n\nBut soon enough (immediately pretty much) I started to see things in the pictures I was taking. Then they became more obvious and more ominous. Ever since that fateful day, which had started much like any other, I have been cursed with haunted pics, no matter what I do most of the time. It's Hell. \n\nThe effects of the Poltergeist are varied. Lots of the pictures I take of people just look like ghostly apparitions - like normal people but floating about looking blurred, as if the ghost is manipulating reality towards the shadow realm, or maybe even the photons themselves are being warped by the presence of a spectre in the lens.\n\nSome photos are just blackness and at least 2 have just been pictures of the ground. That could be my fault though. One one trip, the Poltergeist even moved the CF card from the camera into my card reader and I didn't realise until I got home and I didn't have the photographs of any of the women I saw. That ghostly taunting message popping up on the screen made so much more sense now. \n\nThe next day, I put the CF card in, and it still came up with the same taunting message about the battery being low. I did the hack where you take the power block out and recharge it and it fixed it for a while but I have to do it pretty much all the time after any late night session with spiders in my house. But enough about me.\n\nThe final straw when I knew my ghost had taken things too far was when it photoshopped pictures of my amazing best friend and my girlfriend having sex. I can tell you, I certainly gave that ghost a piece of my mind for treating my best friend like an animal in that way and my girlfriend too. I remember my girlfriend sort of looked really sad at the time, in so many different ways. Probably because understood the pain I go through.\n\nBut enough about me, I don't want me to come across as arrogant or some sort of drama queen, but I came to find out based on multiple possibilities and my own experience that the mysterious camera guy was the Devil, and he had most likely given me a cursed camera for some sort of malevolent purpose, or maybe just a hellish prank?\n\nHe's not asked me to take that photo for him yet, but I'm not worried because I don't think he will. It is like when you give a kid a skateboard and you tell him to show you a trick some day and he never does.\n\nI have tried to get rid of the camera but I just can't. I've been to about ten different spots deep in the woods and tried to bury it so it's out of my life for good, but every single time I go back the next day to see if it's been taken and every single time it's in the exact same spot I left it. It's a curse!\n\nMy back has hurt a lot more lately. I don't know if it's related?\n\nAnyway, I Just wondered if anybody else had any experience with a haunted camera, video-recorder, or any haunted electronics really. My great uncle always swore that his 303 was haunted, but one night I heard those riffs bubbling out the attic at 4am and knew that no way on Earth could a haunted synth sound that good. He also died of a meth overdose so he talked a lot of shit. My last digital camera was haunted with many of the same symptoms, but by a different ghost /low-level demon.\n\nI think it is worth mentioning, I took a picture of a dead beetle once so the beetle's spirit might have inhabited my camera, but I since deleted the picture because I didn't want any backlash if it got leaked to the media.
