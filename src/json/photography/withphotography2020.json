Thoughts? /!/ Looking at the market there seem to be two approaches, the MASP selection and fuji's dedicated dials each featuring an A option. Both having some advantages as some disadvantages.\n\nThere also 3 distinct setting scenarios.  \n   The full automatic, point and shoot experience, ideal for amateur users or more lighthearted momments such as a family party.   \n   Full manual, optimal for studio work, flash use, long exposure and cases where speed and losing the moment arent such important factors as absolute control over the settings.   \n   Having most possible control over the settings while still relying on some automation to achive the fast and snappy workflow that manual doesnt offer. This also means that camera would preferably have to control only one parameter at a time.\n\nThe priority modes come from the film era where iso was a fixed value so there where only two changable parameters. So it makes sense to set the value to the most important one to the given scenario leaving the camera to decide the other.\n\nWith digital cameras of today the parameters are 3 ,with fairly usable high isos as well as slow speeds thanks to ibis. The answer is simple.   \nInstead of choosing the most importnt parameter to control (which almost always is the aperture), you should have to choose the less important parameter to be the one set to auto. While obviously still retaining the option of full manual and auto.\n\nFuji's interface offers a similar logic, but since professionals rarely have two parameters set to auto, to change the automated parameter from one to another, say from only auto speed to only auto iso. You have to rotate the first one from A all the way to the preferred value and then rotate the other all the way to A, which is a slow two step process. As is with the regular mode selection where you had to go from Av with set iso, to Manual with auto iso. \n\nOne real world example of such case that comes to mind, would be, say you are shooting at night on the streets with both still subjects such as scenaries or moving as pedestrians or cars. In the case of moving subjects, your setting would be something like, widest f stop, and slowest possible speed that would still be able to freeze the action (according to your focal length) and auto iso.

Little bit excited right now.) \n\nI know y'all don't know me very well, but I'm a daytime shooter. I've shot thousands of bird images, some of which I am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. Thanks to the efforts of a member of this SR ( u/junon ) I figured I ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. Sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. Once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\nI can say that in 10 years of active photography, I've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than I was from 1:00AM to 1:30AM, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. Wow. Whole new game, nothing I'm accustomed to, nothing I'm used to. Felt zero comfort. Oh, and I need to file a police report; one of the bugs I encountered while out, I think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. Yipes.  \n\nBefore I drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; I did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. I went to a spot in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. I live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. So, I knew going in that I wasn't going to be getting an enormous FOV horizon to horizon. This aint Montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. A \"Is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM](https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM) \n\nWow. That's the freakin' Milky Way...well, the edge of it anyways. Having DL'ed Stellarium and also made use of the web version, I'm a bit smarter about it all, and I can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the Milky Way with guest appearances by Kaus Australis and other cast members of the [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nSo, what did I learn? \n\nFirst...it's super not useful to try to use the viewfinder. I'm a traditional \"hold it up to your face like a noob\" shooter. It's the method I've used for all prior photography efforts and thousands of bird pictures. So, to be robbed of that tool is frustrating to a high degree. You're essentially working blind. I found a semi-workable method. Pull focus on a bright star through the view if you can (made difficult by the screen being right below your eye glaring for you), then go on the screen and just be careful not to touch the zoom or focus ring. AF was 100% unsupportive of my efforts, so I used manual. With so little light, the camera was basically warning me \"Hey, stupid head, I'm not going to take an image of the inside of the lens cap. You'll not make me look bad at what I do best. No thank you. Add light or I won't participate.\"\n\nSecond, there are few feelings as helpless as waiting on a 30 second exposure when you don't even know what the framing is like. It's legitimately like being ten feet underground on the screen because you're working blind. First couple shots, if I'd gotten an image of a Jackson Pollock painting I wouldn't have been surprised. You're working blind and that makes a 30 second exposure seem like a weekend waiting to see what each shot is going to turn out like. \"Did I bump the tripod and accidentally point it right at this towering oak tree? Am I framed? Did I bork a setting? All good? Hello? Anybody in there???\"   \n\nThird, I need better glass...probably a better camera to put behind it too. At ISO3200 I was getting pretty substantial noise, but it's a start. This is a (sh\\*\\*ty) kit lens, and for about 99% of what the average person (and myself) would do with this camera, it's sufficient. For Astro...I admit I'm trying to punch well above my weight class. It's a small sensor behind a cheapo lens. It has limits, obviously. I'm fairly sure there are cell phone cameras that could output higher quality than the two \"best\" from my outing. So be it; this is the gear I have. I'm scrimping for a nifty fifty but even it will be scraping the bottom of the barrel because I don't have the cash to drop on a $5,000 camera or a $200 piece of glass. End of Day, ISO3200 is going to be noisy on this camera, but it's what I've got to work with.  My SL1 is not a state of the art rig anymore and I know it. In this, I recognize that my gear is handcuffing me. Have to think the folks who came up with the EOS100 never figured some flatbilly from Tennessee would be trying to take a picture of something 150 Light-Years away from the sensor. So...kinda have to live with the fact that my gear isn't set up for this, and the budget isn't going to be capable of fixing that. This aint the rig for a pixel-peeper, not by a long shot. \n\nFourth, it's fun. More than I expected. It's much like fishing and I love fishing; when I push down the button and wait for the two-second delay (I used 2S to minimize shake) I'm casting the lure and asking a question; do I get something good, or nothing? Is there something here for me on this cast? Each press of the shutter is me asking a question and I'll admit it's a thrill to get an answer that, on the screen, is sort of what I expected. Very gratifying to get it on the desktop monitor in fully noisy-garbled glory. \n\nFifth, I've been doing myself a disservice not shooting raw. I've been toying with the idea of shooting raw for a while and I should have been doing it since day one, minute one. So much more power and control. My best bird to date would look soooo much better if I'd shot it raw and had the control over it. It's a hassle and my dino-saur junky computer struggles through the process, but man, so much control. To those who think \"Well, it doesn't matter, I'm just going to output as a JPG with an 800x600 size anyways, why go to the trouble?\" you're wrong. So much control over so many aspects. Tons of control, tons of options. While raw control matters more in images like the Astro ones, I can now see that it is a powerful tool I shouldn't have waited this long to learn and use. \n\nSixth, I'm gonna get some bug spray. The big jug. Like I said, I think one pulled a knife on me, or was drilling for blood from a deeper source. \n\nSeventh, a few basic parameters helps; Learning from u/junon that I'm just going to have to crank the ISO and live with the noise, it's helpful. To know that it's a long exposure at high ISO, shooting wide open, it's good to have a basic starting point. I did start playing with the settings a bit, but it's always nice to have a starting point of reference to go off of. Some have this instinctively, and for daylight images I do, but for this kind of shooting I was in the weeds and out of my element. I've done a very small amount of shooting where I'm dialing in a \"kill me with noise, daddy\" ISO and running with it. \n\nEighth and finally, I can improve. Not only am I relearning the basics in terms of how to photograph a unique subject, I'm also learning the basics of how to edit raw, how to clean massive noise, how to work with raw images. RawTherapee is a powerful tool and it's on me learn how to make it work for me to the max. Astrophotography is new for me, and it's on me to learn how to do it well within my constraints. \n\nBut it is doable. It is possible. I'd just about bet most everyone reading this might have a camera that could give it a stab. It's not a \"Oh, I must have a 1DX or better, gotta have at least a Hasselblad X1D II to have any success. All beneath that is futile.\" Nah. SL1 Reb with the lousiest kit lens that I refer to lovingly as my \"sh\\*\\*ty kitty\" lens, and go do it. \n\nThe future holds many things of great depth, and I'm lucky to have started with such lousy results; I can only improve!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/gtwa9t/my_first_stab_at_astro/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "came up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "my first stab at astro. /!/ (i apologize in advance for the length. little bit excited right now.) \n\ni know y'all don't know me very well, but i'm a daytime shooter. i've shot thousands of bird images, some of which i am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. thanks to the efforts of a member of this sr ( u/junon ) i figured i ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\ni can say that in 10 years of active photography, i've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than i was from 1:00am to 1:30am, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. wow. whole new game, nothing i'm accustomed to, nothing i'm used to. felt zero comfort. oh, and i need to file a police report; one of the bugs i encountered while out, i think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. yipes.  \n\nbefore i drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; i did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. i went to a spot in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. i live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. so, i knew going in that i wasn't going to be getting an enormous fov horizon to horizon. this aint montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. a \"is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7a5d4nm](https://imgur.com/a/7a5d4nm) \n\nwow. that's the freakin' milky way...well, the edge of it anyways. having dl'ed stellarium and also made use of the web version, i'm a bit smarter about it all, and i can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the milky way with guest appearances by kaus australis and other cast members of the [sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nso, what did i learn?

He wanted to see if he could do it professionally, so he'd go to some beautiful location like Iceland, make timelapses, and put them out there. However, he found that the market was already fairly saturated by the time he was doing it (a few years ago), and only the first few people to do it had a shot at becoming well known for it and being able to make a career of it.

It's raining here for weeks already with not the greatest conditions for landscape photography, so I took out my macro lens to photograph some mushrooms in the forest. The great thing about this is that you can do this with any kind of light at any moment of the day. \n\nThe mushrooms are (in NL at least) literally everywhere and you can find them especially on wet trees that fell down in forests. Now this was actually the first time I went out to photograph these mushrooms, and I immediately got addicted! So I can recommend this to anyone who loves this style of photography :) I planned to only go to the forest for about an hour, but I stayed the whole day with so much muscle pain as a result (had to lower myself all the time to shoot the tiny mushrooms on the forest floor). Here are some images and tips that I came up with:\n\n\\- Get very low. The prettiest mushrooms are often the tiniest. Sometimes you don't even see them immediately. They can be on fallen trees or directly on the forest floor. You don't want to photograph them at an angle, but from the same height as were they are. So get low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbo1fxui4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21a086012729652e7fe83751e70474ca3317f62\n\n\\- The background is more important than the subject. This was what I found most important when photographing these little guys. By moving the camera just a few mm, the composition and background completely changes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9rnctrk4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b49009e4eecb73797a1d55a32ce40f0d4809f0\n\n\\- Use foreground bokeh. By getting low with your camera and having some leaves or grass in front of your lens, you'll have both dreamy foreground blur AND background blur. You can also use red leaves and put them in front of your lens a bit to create that autumn feeling. This way you create more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A red leaf in the foreground gives that extra depth](https://preview.redd.it/zrrqu95m4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17929506f305565f15a1af58b566d4551b48629)\n\n\\- Use a macro lens or extension tubes. All of these images were made with a 90mm macro. Its my favourite focal length to shoot these kind of shots. You can also get extension tubes for your lens to be able to focus closer to do macro shots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12z39wnw4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0b0a90465b4661cb4cb60371470623978330d73\n\n\\- Use a wide open aperture for extremely dreamy look. I almost always use my macro lens wide open at f/2.8. This way the depth of field is very tiny, and it allows me to create these very dreamy shots.\n\n\\- Find single little mushrooms. There are often big packs of mushrooms that can be very tempting to photograph. But the most beautiful ones are often the very tiny single ones. Because you can make beautiful framing of a single little mushroom with the dreamy background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbieldxr4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fdf83ece48b63473a558e37a38e4bd81322ec9\n\n\\- Photograph them slightly from below so you can see the texture inside. This is something I only noticed later. As a newbie mushroom photographer, I had to 'learn' that they looked so beautiful from the inside. They're often very tiny and low on the ground, so getting below them can be tricky. It gets easier when they're on a tree. By getting lower and photographing them from below, you'll see the beautiful textures in the mushrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj76n8rt4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0558aaa8cf5f7ba5bf9cd0e2798909c1a842ea\n\n\\- A flip screen is super handy. If you don't have a flip screen you basically need to lie on the ground to see what you're doing. I was able to take all these shots by crouching down and looking at my flip screen. Makes things a little bit easier\n\n\\- Use hand held. Some people might disagree with this tip. But I shot all of these images hand held. By using the camera hand held I was able to very quickly switch up my angles and composition. Focusing is HARD though, and the forest is often dark. So most of these images are taken at ISO 400-500. If you're shooting on a tripod, you'll want to shoot with your center column upside down so that you can place your camera very low to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlujc4cv4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2c06612f84b268ba5a9fecd366125c80d440a6\n\n\\- Bring something to sit on. Now as I was saying, I crouched for almost all of these shots. As a result of hours doing this, I have so much muscle pain today :D Next time I'll bring a cloth to sit on, it makes things so much easier!\n\nNow I don't consider myself a pro at macro photography, so feel free to give me any tips as well :) I really enjoyed photographing these mushrooms and it's almost like an entire new tiny world. I'll go back soon to shoot more. You can find more of my work on my [website](https://www.albertdros.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/albertdrosphotography).

 -----> up !!!  -----> with !!! :\n\n\\- get very low. the prettiest mushrooms are often the tiniest. sometimes you don't even see them immediately. they can be on fallen trees or directly on the forest floor. you don't want to photograph them at an angle, but from the same height as were they are. so get low.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbo1fxui4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21a086012729652e7fe83751e70474ca3317f62\n\n\\- the background is more important than the subject. this was what i found most important when photographing these little guys. by moving the camera just a few mm, the composition and background completely changes. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9rnctrk4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b49009e4eecb73797a1d55a32ce40f0d4809f0\n\n\\- use foreground bokeh. by getting low with your camera and having some leaves or grass in front of your lens, you'll have both dreamy foreground blur and background blur. you can also use red leaves and put them in front of your lens a bit to create that autumn feeling. this way you create more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[a red leaf in the foreground gives that extra depth](https://preview.redd.it/zrrqu95m4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17929506f305565f15a1af58b566d4551b48629)\n\n\\- use a macro lens or extension tubes. all of these images were made with a 90mm macro. its my favourite focal length to shoot these kind of shots. you can also get extension tubes for your lens to be able to focus closer to do macro shots.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12z39wnw4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0b0a90465b4661cb4cb60371470623978330d73\n\n\\- use a wide open aperture for extremely dreamy look. i almost always use my macro lens wide open at f/2.8. this way the depth of field is very tiny, and it allows me to create these very dreamy shots.\n\n\\- find single little mushrooms. there are often big packs of mushrooms that can be very tempting to photograph. but the most beautiful ones are often the very tiny single ones. because you can make beautiful framing of a single little mushroom with the dreamy background.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbieldxr4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fdf83ece48b63473a558e37a38e4bd81322ec9\n\n\\- photograph them slightly from below so you can see the texture inside. this is something i only noticed later. as a newbie mushroom photographer, i had to 'learn' that they looked so beautiful from the inside. they're often very tiny and low on the ground, so getting below them can be tricky. it gets easier when they're on a tree. by getting lower and photographing them from below, you'll see the beautiful textures in the mushrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj76n8rt4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0558aaa8cf5f7ba5bf9cd0e2798909c1a842ea\n\n\\- a flip screen is super handy. if you don't have a flip screen you basically need to lie on the ground to see what you're doing. i was able to take all these shots by crouching down and looking at my flip screen. makes things a little bit easier\n\n\\- use hand held. some people might disagree with this tip. but i shot all of these images hand held. by using the camera hand held i was able to very quickly switch up my angles and composition. focusing is hard though, and the forest is often dark. so most of these images are taken at iso 400-500. if you're shooting on a tripod, you'll want to shoot with your center column upside down so that you can place your camera very low to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlujc4cv4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2c06612f84b268ba5a9fecd366125c80d440a6\n\n\\- bring something to sit on. now as i was saying, i crouched for almost all of these shots. as a result of hours doing this, i have so much muscle pain today :d next time i'll bring a cloth to sit on, it makes things so much easier!\n\nnow i don't consider myself a pro at macro photography, so feel free to give me any tips as well :) i really enjoyed photographing these mushrooms and it's almost like an entire new tiny world. i'll go back soon to shoot more. you can find more of my work on my [website](https://www.albertdros.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/albertdrosphotography). and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\ncheers!\n\nalbert", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 84056, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "fabelmay", "date": "2020-11-26 03:20:01", "content": "Coming up with concepts for broad themes /!/ Hi everyone, \nFor one of my classes we are having a little mock photography competition (it\u2019s not a photography class).

TL/DR at the bottom for those not wanting to wade through the fiasco.\n\nQuick backstory. I have a full time day job where I shoot video and stills for a company. I shoot fine art, fashion, editorial images outside of that job as a hobby. This was one of my for-fun, hobby shoots. At the end of the day, I'm more passionate about my hobby work as it's a much purer form of self-expression than my day job. \n\nOnward. \n\nI reached out to a contact that I've worked with previously on a commercial shoot, asking if she'd like to work together soon. Got a reply back right away with her being super stoked, said she'd been meaning to reach out to me and then sent along a bunch of creative inspirational images to get our gears turning. Included in those shots were some stunning fine art, abstract nude poses in nature, on rocks, in the woods, etc. We're fortunate to live in Sonoma County, so access to redwoods and big coastal rock formations is here at our finger tips. \n\nWe set our shoot date, continued to plan out the details and this last Sunday we both drove out to the coast and shot together for over four hours. Oh boy, we both pushed ourselves creatively too, working in the rain, cold, bugs, wet gear, soggy clothing, slippery rocks, hiking - all while really observing the landscape and features seeing how we could work her poses into what mother nature presented. I'm sure that sounds cheesy, but our creative wave lengths were in sync the entire time. She was often the one pulling the shots too, with my being there to make her vision to come to life. \n\nSunset came and went, blue hour set in and we headed back to our cars and the day was over. It was one of those shoots were you felt exhausted by the work and also completely energized by how smoothly it all went. There's so much less negative struggle involved when you find compatible, creative people that just get it and are helping to drive a shoot forward. \n\nThe images are stunning and I was STOKED to share. This is some of my best work, and I've been shooting people/models for about 15-years. Nothing about this shoot felt cheap, no shortcuts were taken and my hope was that these images would inspire future work by attracting other like-minded people to want to work with me. Hopes were REALLY high at this point. \n\nThis morning I fired off the gallery link to the model and got a reply back a few hours later. She explained how she loved the images, showed them to her partner who then went on a big rant about how he wasn't comfortable with the world seeing her nude, even censored. They got into a huge fight, and in the end she buckled to his fears to save the peace and agreed that they'd never see the light of day. \n\nGuess it's been a rough couple of days for her since the shoot, and it's not my place to say how two people should be together in a relationship. While on our shoot we were both chatting about how great it was to have supportive partners that each give us the trust to express ourselves creatively, but she said this shoot took him past some breaking point. From what I gather, they're already going through a rocky period and this shoot just really upset the apple cart. By the end of our chat, it was clear he has a lot of growing to do (in her own words). It was less about the images themselves and more to do with spending the day nude, with another man, with his viewpoint being that it's simply impossible that the experience wasn't somehow sexual and that the images won't be interpreted as being sexual. If he were to stumble onto these images, it would \"hit a sore spot\" so it's better to not post them at all.\n\nObviously I can't share the images, but if you look at [David Hanagan's IG feed](https://www.instagram.com/davidhanagan/), you can get a sense of what we shot, but with less of that faded IG look and even more dramatic surroundings. \n\nSome of the shots were with her in bodysuit and many had all her private areas completely hidden with the pose and/or with the landscape. Honestly, she has more revealing photos of herself in bikinis \"out on the lake\" or while hiking on her feed. Again, not the images but more to do with his insecurities. I feel like this shoot put the two of them at a pretty big crossroads, and that they were already headed in that direction anyway... \n\nSo what could I have done differently? Ah, some of you are probably already foaming at the mouth wanting to type, \"So idiot, this is why you have had her sign a release.\" I hear ya, but I'm not the kind of person that would leverage a release or contract over another person's head in this type of circumstance. Doing that would be a total dick move, it would make her situation worse and I'd ruin a few connected friendships in the process. \n\nIn the end she rightfully has taken complete responsibility for how this all turned out. She completely misjudged how her partner would react and in the end that relationship is more important than the images and my time. I get that. Could she have offered some money to make up for my time? Sure! However she didn't offer and through our LONG ass chats, it's clear she's going through some shit right now and I'm not really in need of any extra cash. Again, we've got some close mutual friends and keeping the peace is my #1 priority at this point. \n\nShe's now offering to let me use some of the images on my website, un-credited, so there's a small win.  \n\nAnyone else experience anything like this?

ah, some of you are probably already foaming at the mouth wanting to type, \"so idiot, this is why you have had her sign a release.\" i hear ya, but i'm not the kind of person that would leverage a release or contract over another person's head in this type of circumstance. doing that would be a total dick move, it would make her situation worse and i'd ruin a few connected friendships in the process. \n\nin the end she rightfully has taken complete responsibility for how this all turned out. she completely misjudged how her partner would react and in the end that relationship is more important than the images and my time. i get that. could she have offered some money to make up for my time? sure! however she didn't offer and through our long ass chats, it's clear she's going through some shit right now and i'm not really in need of any extra cash. again, we've got some close mutual friends and keeping the peace is my #1 priority at this point. \n\nshe's now offering to let me use some of the images on my website, un-credited, so there's a small win.  \n\nanyone else experience anything like this?

But sometimes the smaller things can be just as impressive. In this little article I\u2019ll be I am giving some tips to you Redditers to hopefully give you some inspiration when photographing abstracts. And when you start to see them, you can\u2019t stop photographing them. It\u2019s very addicting!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Look down.\n\nWe tend to look forward and see the bigger picture. But beauty is often just at our feet. Go low to the ground and look down occasionally. You\u2019ll find all kinds of interesting things. Think of textures on stones, lines little plants, patterns, contrast. Lots of interesting abstract shapes can be found on the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A simple mud cracks pattern](https://preview.redd.it/ke5i10j4qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf445712636425af84d3357796a4dd5d3b1dc678)\n\n[Autumn vegetation on the ground](https://preview.redd.it/6wb7k3q6qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c0b7c9371ff213fab85e668a53f3b446da78d1e)\n\n2. You don't need a macro lens.\n\nAbstract landscapes can be shot with any kind of lens. I usually shoot them with a 24-70 (close focus is a pre) or sometimes a longer lens to capture patterns in the distance.\n\n[Black sand ripples caused by the tide in Iceland](https://preview.redd.it/ygm7yhf9qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b266d6823541a0b3f913124267ee8b5f4f4784d0)\n\n3. Look at lines\n\nWhen looking at subjects, find lines and try to balance them in your frame. Lines going from a corner into the frame often work well. Flowing lines also give a nice feel to an image.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Interesting lines and textures on a hill in Iceland](https://preview.redd.it/1sgv7aibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff7b15c14aa0cf728ffae3329cfbd2918da011d6)\n\n[Grassy hills in Kyrgyzstan](https://preview.redd.it/av1g1bibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973d3f010894ea66be98a24a63ea65bd116c8a31)\n\n[Lines on a piece of ice going from bright to dark](https://preview.redd.it/da3krbibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7076b84a57688758ef1ab1407e2ceeeaeb57147e)\n\n4. Look at color contrast\n\nA combination of 2 Colors or dark and bright tones often work well in abstracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A combination of colour contrast and lines on a close up of a house in Burano, Venice.](https://preview.redd.it/uln6oufmqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be064e264cbc6d811a8f9442a6df97878aa54f0)\n\n[Little sand bumps hit by the sun turn to gold. The dark and bright works well here.](https://preview.redd.it/mw6526foqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f55ee4c2b6bb2373cd00b75d1782b9ebb5e247)\n\n5. Lose perspective and scale. This has to do with looking at the smaller things in the \u2018bigger\u2019 picture again. When photographing abstracts its important to not show the surrounding. This way the viewer has no idea about the scale and perspective. When you photograph a sand texture the right way for example, it can look like a desert from above. It\u2019s fun to trick the viewer and let them think about your photo.\n\n[This could be an image of a desert shot from a plane, but its actually just a shot of some sand ripples shot with a 24-70 lens.](https://preview.redd.it/t0hlbi3qqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a4a67771d18590308c15f486b137935ee1aec4d)\n\n6. Find single objects in negative space\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Showing a lot of emptiness in the frame with a small subject gives a nice abstract look.](https://preview.redd.it/7zqcsirrqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd3676dbd6119b370420b226718cca62b8c290d4)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jd0g2h5tqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0eec8ede35df559dd5f189f1ca89327037b88ea\n\n7. Go to the beach! The beach often has lots of sand textures. Especially when the tide is low you can find patterns in the sand everywhere. They sometimes look like aerials and completely let the viewer lose perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A sand texture hit from the side by sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/0fq32u4vqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7552178819c8ba2a8498241ab0b66e8bc2f688ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Water. Water by itself is just incredible. Think of falling water from a waterfall or just the tap at home! Falling water in different strengths creates beautiful pattern. When photograph falling water, use an extremely fast shutter speed (1/1000 or faster) and just shoot away. You\u2019ll see you come up with lots of interesting shots! But not only falling water. Also ripples in the sea can create interesting photos depending on how the waves are and how the light hits. And then there is frozen water. Frozen water creates cracks and interesting ice textures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dropping water from a waterfall](https://preview.redd.it/jirtikiyqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed3cc5f934c7d1ed57e4c77901ecbd2c578de50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Waves](https://preview.redd.it/qbt9w6uzqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9df7d66b1dcd725c47865fd099667162e200fe)\n\n[A frozen piece of ice from up close looks like a hallucination pattern](https://preview.redd.it/nrtsh9mwqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ead1a46e24dbd28a1bb8a12dd71b5dc2a7a27ff)\n\n[Shapes in a frozen puddle](https://preview.redd.it/7dazc9t0rxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c11e44d2a7cb2fc77fd9899d5d9e5845523e6ab)\n\n9. Harsh light and shadows.\n\nHarsh light during the day is often not great for landscape photography. But for abstracts it can be great. By playing with shapes and lines in harsh shadows you can sometimes create interesting abstract looks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img fhz6we44rxd41...*\n\n10 Look up close. Abstract landscapes are everywhere. You just have to learn to see them. Textures in stones, lines in plants, clouds. The trick is to look closely. Look closer to everything you see in daily life and you\u2019ll be surprised how much interesting things you see.

the beach often has lots of sand textures. especially when the tide is low you can find patterns in the sand everywhere. they sometimes look like aerials and completely let the viewer lose perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[a sand texture hit from the side by sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/0fq32u4vqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7552178819c8ba2a8498241ab0b66e8bc2f688ed)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n8. water. water by itself is just incredible. think of falling water from a waterfall or just the tap at home! falling water in different strengths creates beautiful pattern. when photograph falling water, use an extremely fast shutter speed (1/1000 or faster) and just shoot away. you\u2019ll see you -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  lots of interesting shots! but not only falling water. also ripples in the sea can create interesting photos depending on how the waves are and how the light hits. and then there is frozen water. frozen water creates cracks and interesting ice textures.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[dropping water from a waterfall](https://preview.redd.it/jirtikiyqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed3cc5f934c7d1ed57e4c77901ecbd2c578de50)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[waves](https://preview.redd.it/qbt9w6uzqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9df7d66b1dcd725c47865fd099667162e200fe)\n\n[a frozen piece of ice from up close looks like a hallucination pattern](https://preview.redd.it/nrtsh9mwqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ead1a46e24dbd28a1bb8a12dd71b5dc2a7a27ff)\n\n[shapes in a frozen puddle](https://preview.redd.it/7dazc9t0rxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c11e44d2a7cb2fc77fd9899d5d9e5845523e6ab)\n\n9. harsh light and shadows.\n\nharsh light during the day is often not great for landscape photography. but for abstracts it can be great. by playing with shapes and lines in harsh shadows you can sometimes create interesting abstract looks.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n*processing img fhz6we44rxd41...*\n\n10 look up close. abstract landscapes are everywhere. you just have to learn to see them. textures in stones, lines in plants, clouds. the trick is to look closely. look closer to everything you see in daily life and you\u2019ll be surprised how much interesting things you see. but be-careful, its very addicting!

Even though I do not use pixel editors much, and did not have enough time to trial, I just bought it and kept it aside to see if it can help me. After using for a few weeks, I felt it will be good to share a user review.\n\n**Elephant in the room:**\n\nBefore I begin, I do not use any Adobe products and hence there will be no comparisons. While I will discuss some aspects with regards to other tools, I want to be sure you may feel free to add any corrections towards any reference without prejudice.\n\n\n**RAW Editor vs Pixel Editor:**\n\nI have been pretty much using RAW editors for a long time and my Go-To tools are Capture NX-D, darktable, RawTherapee, DXO and recently Capture One Express. As you can see, I do not stick to one tool and I like to play around tools. \ndarktable is my primary Raw editor and most of the pixel level edits can be simply done within dt. But for anything more, I use Gimp for layers, a bit of masking and that is about it. So my experience with pixel editors is extremely limited. However, I have used Photoshop when I was in school and the good thing about using darktable is you learn a lot of underlying logic, rather than one button/slider that does things for you. So, I cannot rate myself a beginner but more an intermediate user of Affinity right off the bat.\n\n**What I like:**\n\nThis tool is fast and almost makes me feel like everything I used is slow.\nIt feels like one of those new age tools that are built in this millennium. You open a brush and hover over, it will show a real-time preview. If you open a curves layer, you can go back and adjust which layer it will impact and how much opacity you need, or even turn off background layers to better see what result will look good. All this while still having the curves adjustment layer open and ready to take changes.\nYou can plan around and make almost all changes non-destructive within the file. Want to apply blur and then reduce it later, possible. Want to double the sharpening and then reduce it by 75%, simple. Changed your mind and want to localize sharpening again. There is no concept of smart objects, just change the adjustment layers and it is all done.\nBy default, all adjustment layers are full opacity mask layers, so saves a lot of time if you want any further adjustments.\nHandling of tif and jpeg colors is nice. I know this is a strange thing to say, but coming from Raw editors, it is a high bar for pixel editors, and I like colors from AFP quite a lot. (It is not the same for Raw files)\nThe selection tool is just to the point and very good and the in-paining tool (similar but not as powerful as content aware in PS) is a nifty tool that saves a lot of clicks. Gradient tool is easy to use again, you can make it editable via fx options.\n\n\n**What I do not like:**\n\nThe brush preview sometimes could be delayed, which means you will brush on areas that are not intended as the effect will appear later.\nThe RAW editor is sub-par. It is not even user friendly. Perhaps a dead give-away that Affinity will come up with a Lightroom competitor and want to keep the Raw editor rather limited. This is not a deal breaker for me as I have plenty of Raw editors, and as I play around, I realize it is capable.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nI paid the 50% discount price and I am yet to wrap my head around the fact, people are not jumping over this tool for full price. I prefer an open source workflow and I did not need it when I bought it, but I can see this becoming my primary editing tool simply because it makes my work a lot faster.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/hpyz4l/affinity_photo_a_simple_review_and_some_comments/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "affinity photo \u2013 a simple review and some comments after a brief use /!/ around may i saw some chatter around affinity photo being on sale. even though i do not use pixel editors much, and did not have enough time to trial, i just bought it and kept it aside to see if it can help me. after using for a few weeks, i felt it will be good to share a user review.\n\n**elephant in the room:**\n\nbefore i begin, i do not use any adobe products and hence there will be no comparisons. while i will discuss some aspects with regards to other tools, i want to be sure you may feel free to add any corrections towards any reference without prejudice.\n\n\n**raw editor vs pixel editor:**\n\ni have been pretty much using raw editors for a long time and my go-to tools are capture nx-d, darktable, rawtherapee, dxo and recently capture one express. as you can see, i do not stick to one tool and i like to play around tools. \ndarktable is my primary raw editor and most of the pixel level edits can be simply done within dt. but for anything more, i use gimp for layers, a bit of masking and that is about it. so my experience with pixel editors is extremely limited. however, i have used photoshop when i was in school and the good thing about using darktable is you learn a lot of underlying logic, rather than one button/slider that does things for you. so, i cannot rate myself a beginner but more an intermediate user of affinity right off the bat.\n\n**what i like:**\n\nthis tool is fast and almost makes me feel like everything i used is slow.\nit feels like one of those new age tools that are built in this millennium. you open a brush and hover over, it will show a real-time preview. if you open a curves layer, you can go back and adjust which layer it will impact and how much opacity you need, or even turn off background layers to better see what result will look good. all this while still having the curves adjustment layer open and ready to take changes.\nyou can plan around and make almost all changes non-destructive within the file. want to apply blur and then reduce it later, possible. want to double the sharpening and then reduce it by 75%, simple. changed your mind and want to localize sharpening again. there is no concept of smart objects, just change the adjustment layers and it is all done.\nby default, all adjustment layers are full opacity mask layers, so saves a lot of time if you want any further adjustments.\nhandling of tif and jpeg colors is nice. i know this is a strange thing to say, but coming from raw editors, it is a high bar for pixel editors, and i like colors from afp quite a lot.
