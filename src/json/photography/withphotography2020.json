I usually use \"multi\" metering mode, which works most of the time. Like described above, sometimes the camera overexposes by 1 to 2 stops when shooting shadow areas. In reality those areas are much darker but the camera tries to expose them as average.\n\nFor example I recently shot a soccer game. It was a very sunny noon. One site of the soccer field was under the shadows of the trees behind it.

Thoughts? /!/ Looking at the market there seem to be two approaches, the MASP selection and fuji's dedicated dials each featuring an A option. Both having some advantages as some disadvantages.\n\nThere also 3 distinct setting scenarios.  \n   The full automatic, point and shoot experience, ideal for amateur users or more lighthearted momments such as a family party.   \n   Full manual, optimal for studio work, flash use, long exposure and cases where speed and losing the moment arent such important factors as absolute control over the settings.   \n   Having most possible control over the settings while still relying on some automation to achive the fast and snappy workflow that manual doesnt offer. This also means that camera would preferably have to control only one parameter at a time.\n\nThe priority modes come from the film era where iso was a fixed value so there where only two changable parameters. So it makes sense to set the value to the most important one to the given scenario leaving the camera to decide the other.\n\nWith digital cameras of today the parameters are 3 ,with fairly usable high isos as well as slow speeds thanks to ibis. The answer is simple.   \nInstead of choosing the most importnt parameter to control (which almost always is the aperture), you should have to choose the less important parameter to be the one set to auto. While obviously still retaining the option of full manual and auto.\n\nFuji's interface offers a similar logic, but since professionals rarely have two parameters set to auto, to change the automated parameter from one to another, say from only auto speed to only auto iso. You have to rotate the first one from A all the way to the preferred value and then rotate the other all the way to A, which is a slow two step process. As is with the regular mode selection where you had to go from Av with set iso, to Manual with auto iso. \n\nOne real world example of such case that comes to mind, would be, say you are shooting at night on the streets with both still subjects such as scenaries or moving as pedestrians or cars. In the case of moving subjects, your setting would be something like, widest f stop, and slowest possible speed that would still be able to freeze the action (according to your focal length) and auto iso. Then switching to shoot still subjects you would change to an optimal iso given that even if speed runs slow with ibis would be much of a problem. \n\nI would like to know your thoughts on that.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jmya22/i_just_came_up_with_a_better_and_more_logical/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "came up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "i just -----> came !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  a better and more logical alternative to the classic mode selection, (that its not the fuji way) and its really simple. thoughts? /!/ looking at the market there seem to be two approaches, the masp selection and fuji's dedicated dials each featuring an a option. both having some advantages as some disadvantages.\n\nthere also 3 distinct setting scenarios.  \n   the full automatic, point and shoot experience, ideal for amateur users or more lighthearted momments such as a family party.   \n   full manual, optimal for studio work, flash use, long exposure and cases where speed and losing the moment arent such important factors as absolute control over the settings.   \n   having most possible control over the settings while still relying on some automation to achive the fast and snappy workflow that manual doesnt offer. this also means that camera would preferably have to control only one parameter at a time.\n\nthe priority modes come from the film era where iso was a fixed value so there where only two changable parameters. so it makes sense to set the value to the most important one to the given scenario leaving the camera to decide the other.\n\nwith digital cameras of today the parameters are 3 ,with fairly usable high isos as well as slow speeds thanks to ibis. the answer is simple.   \ninstead of choosing the most importnt parameter to control (which almost always is the aperture), you should have to choose the less important parameter to be the one set to auto. while obviously still retaining the option of full manual and auto.\n\nfuji's interface offers a similar logic, but since professionals rarely have two parameters set to auto, to change the automated parameter from one to another, say from only auto speed to only auto iso. you have to rotate the first one from a all the way to the preferred value and then rotate the other all the way to a, which is a slow two step process. as is with the regular mode selection where you had to go from av with set iso, to manual with auto iso. \n\none real world example of such case that comes to mind, would be, say you are shooting at night on the streets with both still subjects such as scenaries or moving as pedestrians or cars. in the case of moving subjects, your setting would be something like, widest f stop, and slowest possible speed that would still be able to freeze the action (according to your focal length) and auto iso. then switching to shoot still subjects you would change to an optimal iso given that even if speed runs slow with ibis would be much of a problem. \n\ni would like to know your thoughts on that.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 65851, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "zon03", "date": "2020-11-12 12:35:16", "content": "Island photography, getting creative? /!/ I am going to the Island of Gran Canaria soon, an amazing place that I absolutely fell in love with on my last trip there.

Little bit excited right now.) \n\nI know y'all don't know me very well, but I'm a daytime shooter. I've shot thousands of bird images, some of which I am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. Thanks to the efforts of a member of this SR ( u/junon ) I figured I ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. Sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. Once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\nI can say that in 10 years of active photography, I've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than I was from 1:00AM to 1:30AM, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. Wow. Whole new game, nothing I'm accustomed to, nothing I'm used to. Felt zero comfort. Oh, and I need to file a police report; one of the bugs I encountered while out, I think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. Yipes.  \n\nBefore I drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; I did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. I went to a spot in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. I live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. So, I knew going in that I wasn't going to be getting an enormous FOV horizon to horizon. This aint Montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. A \"Is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM](https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM) \n\nWow. That's the freakin' Milky Way...well, the edge of it anyways. Having DL'ed Stellarium and also made use of the web version, I'm a bit smarter about it all, and I can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the Milky Way with guest appearances by Kaus Australis and other cast members of the [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nSo, what did I learn? \n\nFirst...it's super not useful to try to use the viewfinder. I'm a traditional \"hold it up to your face like a noob\" shooter. It's the method I've used for all prior photography efforts and thousands of bird pictures. So, to be robbed of that tool is frustrating to a high degree. You're essentially working blind. I found a semi-workable method. Pull focus on a bright star through the view if you can (made difficult by the screen being right below your eye glaring for you), then go on the screen and just be careful not to touch the zoom or focus ring. AF was 100% unsupportive of my efforts, so I used manual. With so little light, the camera was basically warning me \"Hey, stupid head, I'm not going to take an image of the inside of the lens cap. You'll not make me look bad at what I do best. No thank you. Add light or I won't participate.\"\n\nSecond, there are few feelings as helpless as waiting on a 30 second exposure when you don't even know what the framing is like. It's legitimately like being ten feet underground on the screen because you're working blind. First couple shots, if I'd gotten an image of a Jackson Pollock painting I wouldn't have been surprised. You're working blind and that makes a 30 second exposure seem like a weekend waiting to see what each shot is going to turn out like. \"Did I bump the tripod and accidentally point it right at this towering oak tree? Am I framed? Did I bork a setting? All good? Hello? Anybody in there???\"   \n\nThird, I need better glass...probably a better camera to put behind it too. At ISO3200 I was getting pretty substantial noise, but it's a start. This is a (sh\\*\\*ty) kit lens, and for about 99% of what the average person (and myself) would do with this camera, it's sufficient. For Astro...I admit I'm trying to punch well above my weight class. It's a small sensor behind a cheapo lens. It has limits, obviously. I'm fairly sure there are cell phone cameras that could output higher quality than the two \"best\" from my outing. So be it; this is the gear I have. I'm scrimping for a nifty fifty but even it will be scraping the bottom of the barrel because I don't have the cash to drop on a $5,000 camera or a $200 piece of glass. End of Day, ISO3200 is going to be noisy on this camera, but it's what I've got to work with.  My SL1 is not a state of the art rig anymore and I know it. In this, I recognize that my gear is handcuffing me. Have to think the folks who came up with the EOS100 never figured some flatbilly from Tennessee would be trying to take a picture of something 150 Light-Years away from the sensor. So...kinda have to live with the fact that my gear isn't set up for this, and the budget isn't going to be capable of fixing that. This aint the rig for a pixel-peeper, not by a long shot. \n\nFourth, it's fun. More than I expected. It's much like fishing and I love fishing; when I push down the button and wait for the two-second delay (I used 2S to minimize shake) I'm casting the lure and asking a question; do I get something good, or nothing? Is there something here for me on this cast? Each press of the shutter is me asking a question and I'll admit it's a thrill to get an answer that, on the screen, is sort of what I expected. Very gratifying to get it on the desktop monitor in fully noisy-garbled glory. \n\nFifth, I've been doing myself a disservice not shooting raw. I've been toying with the idea of shooting raw for a while and I should have been doing it since day one, minute one. So much more power and control. My best bird to date would look soooo much better if I'd shot it raw and had the control over it. It's a hassle and my dino-saur junky computer struggles through the process, but man, so much control. To those who think \"Well, it doesn't matter, I'm just going to output as a JPG with an 800x600 size anyways, why go to the trouble?\" you're wrong. So much control over so many aspects. Tons of control, tons of options. While raw control matters more in images like the Astro ones, I can now see that it is a powerful tool I shouldn't have waited this long to learn and use. \n\nSixth, I'm gonna get some bug spray. The big jug. Like I said, I think one pulled a knife on me, or was drilling for blood from a deeper source. \n\nSeventh, a few basic parameters helps; Learning from u/junon that I'm just going to have to crank the ISO and live with the noise, it's helpful. To know that it's a long exposure at high ISO, shooting wide open, it's good to have a basic starting point. I did start playing with the settings a bit, but it's always nice to have a starting point of reference to go off of. Some have this instinctively, and for daylight images I do, but for this kind of shooting I was in the weeds and out of my element. I've done a very small amount of shooting where I'm dialing in a \"kill me with noise, daddy\" ISO and running with it. \n\nEighth and finally, I can improve. Not only am I relearning the basics in terms of how to photograph a unique subject, I'm also learning the basics of how to edit raw, how to clean massive noise, how to work with raw images. RawTherapee is a powerful tool and it's on me learn how to make it work for me to the max. Astrophotography is new for me, and it's on me to learn how to do it well within my constraints. \n\nBut it is doable. It is possible. I'd just about bet most everyone reading this might have a camera that could give it a stab. It's not a \"Oh, I must have a 1DX or better, gotta have at least a Hasselblad X1D II to have any success. All beneath that is futile.\" Nah. SL1 Reb with the lousiest kit lens that I refer to lovingly as my \"sh\\*\\*ty kitty\" lens, and go do it. \n\nThe future holds many things of great depth, and I'm lucky to have started with such lousy results; I can only improve!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/gtwa9t/my_first_stab_at_astro/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "came up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "my first stab at astro. /!/ (i apologize in advance for the length. little bit excited right now.) \n\ni know y'all don't know me very well, but i'm a daytime shooter. i've shot thousands of bird images, some of which i am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. thanks to the efforts of a member of this sr ( u/junon ) i figured i ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\ni can say that in 10 years of active photography, i've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than i was from 1:00am to 1:30am, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. wow. whole new game, nothing i'm accustomed to, nothing i'm used to. felt zero comfort. oh, and i need to file a police report; one of the bugs i encountered while out, i think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. yipes.  \n\nbefore i drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; i did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. i went to a spot in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. i live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. so, i knew going in that i wasn't going to be getting an enormous fov horizon to horizon. this aint montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. a \"is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7a5d4nm](https://imgur.com/a/7a5d4nm) \n\nwow. that's the freakin' milky way...well, the edge of it anyways. having dl'ed stellarium and also made use of the web version, i'm a bit smarter about it all, and i can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the milky way with guest appearances by kaus australis and other cast members of the [sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nso, what did i learn?

I've landed on a system that mostly works for my day-to-day operations and my year-to-year storage / archiving (I'll outline that in a bit).  Lately, I've been worrying primarily about what happens to my photos should something happen to me. My wife's been on me to come up with a plan and I truly want to make it easy for her (primary goal) and family members (secondary goal) to access my digital self (in an organized fashion) should I get hit by a bus (or throw away my computer and permanently move to a remote tropical island).\n\nI've researched a lot of these options out there individually, but haven't run into any firsthand experiences that match up with my goals. Most discussions revolve around the use I assume I can't be the only one in this situation!\n\n**Current Setup**:\n\n* Drobo - RAID setup for long term archiving of photos. I think I'm approaching about 3TB and have more drives to combine into this (I need to buy more internal drives!)\n* External HD - Cloning for Drobo offsite backup of Drobo via Carbon Copy Cloner (future state for me)\n* iCloud - I share albums with family members / friends who have iPhones. Of my 75k+ camera roll, I'd probably want to selectively designate about 30% of images to be available to others in whatever long term solution I decide to use.\n* Dropbox - Client sharing (I share a Dropbox folder with clients to deliver final files) \n* SmugMug - Website backend (I do not do any client delivery or eCommerce here - It's really just a website builder for me)\n* Various External Drives - I use these for active / semi-active project files as it is quicker than my Drobo. Might include my year-to-year working files that I eventually archive to my Drobo.\n* Instagram - Of course I share here, but it's photo-by-photo and not a scalable solution (also not full resolution). It's fine for sharing a photo here and there.\n\n**Tools I DON'T use but have looked into**:\n\n* Google - I've not adopted Google for photos - Just email / Google Voice. This is probably a front runner for me right now.\n* AWS - I've looked at it, but never adopted. I do not get the sense that this is right for me, but I'm open to it. \n* Facebook - No, I hate Facebook. But, the \"legacy\" feature is nice in that I can designate someone as being in charge of my account should I die. Also, I don't believe full res photos will be an option.\n* AEM - Probably too expensive and excessive for my needs, but I've thought about using as a CMS as it has great permission control and publishing abilities. Probably akin to killing a fly with a nuke, though.\n\n**Goals**:\n\n* Publish MANY select images that are accessible by family and friends (in the \"cloud\")\n* Upload speeds - I'd love to be able to find something that isn't throttled down too far (as with iCloud - Despite my great upload speeds, I think iCloud throttles what it can receive...)\n* Password protected - Only those I designate should be able to access the files\n* Permission management abilities - I might not want to share certain galleries with one side of the family that were meant for another. For instance, my in laws probably don't care about photos that were taken at my Aunt and Uncle's Thanksgiving, just as my Aunt and Uncle probably don't care about photos published of my Niece-in-law's first birthday. \n* Full resolution photos published with the ability to download by users\n* Organizability - Should be easy to organize into logical albums and groupings of files that are easily interpreted and browsed by end users\n* File types - Photos are my primary objective here, but this could include videos, and could even include a PDF or other type of document here and there.\n* Capacity - This should be able to exceed a couple of terabytes and scale with my needs.\n* Longevity and survivability - Needs uptime and to be with a company / solution that will be around for a while (no fly by night solutions that I can't trust to outlive me).\n* Security - I am a very private person and wish to have these files be very private as well. This has been my hesitation with moving forward on \n* Billing - Able to designate an alternative billing contact to keep the storage going if I am no longer in the picture.\n* Cost - I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for this (but I will if it's the right solution) and would prefer to not be billed by the GB but by the TB - Some kind of plan where it is 1TB, 2TB, 5TB, etc... (this is more mental for me - I don't want to *feel* the money leaving my wallet as I upload the next 500 photos).\n* App-based access by end users - This is a nice to have, but I'd love for my family members to be able to access an app that cleanly displays folders/albums in a logical method (defined by me). This could be a website or a mobile app that offers a gallery-type browsing ability.\n\nI've tossed around using Google Photos. I've thought about just dumping everything into SmugMug.

However, he found that the market was already fairly saturated by the time he was doing it (a few years ago), and only the first few people to do it had a shot at becoming well known for it and being able to make a career of it.

It's raining here for weeks already with not the greatest conditions for landscape photography, so I took out my macro lens to photograph some mushrooms in the forest. The great thing about this is that you can do this with any kind of light at any moment of the day. \n\nThe mushrooms are (in NL at least) literally everywhere and you can find them especially on wet trees that fell down in forests. Now this was actually the first time I went out to photograph these mushrooms, and I immediately got addicted! So I can recommend this to anyone who loves this style of photography :) I planned to only go to the forest for about an hour, but I stayed the whole day with so much muscle pain as a result (had to lower myself all the time to shoot the tiny mushrooms on the forest floor). Here are some images and tips that I came up with:\n\n\\- Get very low. The prettiest mushrooms are often the tiniest. Sometimes you don't even see them immediately. They can be on fallen trees or directly on the forest floor. You don't want to photograph them at an angle, but from the same height as were they are. So get low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbo1fxui4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21a086012729652e7fe83751e70474ca3317f62\n\n\\- The background is more important than the subject. This was what I found most important when photographing these little guys. By moving the camera just a few mm, the composition and background completely changes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9rnctrk4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b49009e4eecb73797a1d55a32ce40f0d4809f0\n\n\\- Use foreground bokeh. By getting low with your camera and having some leaves or grass in front of your lens, you'll have both dreamy foreground blur AND background blur. You can also use red leaves and put them in front of your lens a bit to create that autumn feeling. This way you create more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A red leaf in the foreground gives that extra depth](https://preview.redd.it/zrrqu95m4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17929506f305565f15a1af58b566d4551b48629)\n\n\\- Use a macro lens or extension tubes. All of these images were made with a 90mm macro. Its my favourite focal length to shoot these kind of shots. You can also get extension tubes for your lens to be able to focus closer to do macro shots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12z39wnw4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0b0a90465b4661cb4cb60371470623978330d73\n\n\\- Use a wide open aperture for extremely dreamy look. I almost always use my macro lens wide open at f/2.8. This way the depth of field is very tiny, and it allows me to create these very dreamy shots.\n\n\\- Find single little mushrooms. There are often big packs of mushrooms that can be very tempting to photograph. But the most beautiful ones are often the very tiny single ones. Because you can make beautiful framing of a single little mushroom with the dreamy background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbieldxr4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fdf83ece48b63473a558e37a38e4bd81322ec9\n\n\\- Photograph them slightly from below so you can see the texture inside. This is something I only noticed later. As a newbie mushroom photographer, I had to 'learn' that they looked so beautiful from the inside. They're often very tiny and low on the ground, so getting below them can be tricky. It gets easier when they're on a tree. By getting lower and photographing them from below, you'll see the beautiful textures in the mushrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj76n8rt4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0558aaa8cf5f7ba5bf9cd0e2798909c1a842ea\n\n\\- A flip screen is super handy. If you don't have a flip screen you basically need to lie on the ground to see what you're doing. I was able to take all these shots by crouching down and looking at my flip screen. Makes things a little bit easier\n\n\\- Use hand held. Some people might disagree with this tip. But I shot all of these images hand held. By using the camera hand held I was able to very quickly switch up my angles and composition. Focusing is HARD though, and the forest is often dark. So most of these images are taken at ISO 400-500. If you're shooting on a tripod, you'll want to shoot with your center column upside down so that you can place your camera very low to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlujc4cv4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2c06612f84b268ba5a9fecd366125c80d440a6\n\n\\- Bring something to sit on. Now as I was saying, I crouched for almost all of these shots. As a result of hours doing this, I have so much muscle pain today :D Next time I'll bring a cloth to sit on, it makes things so much easier!\n\nNow I don't consider myself a pro at macro photography, so feel free to give me any tips as well :) I really enjoyed photographing these mushrooms and it's almost like an entire new tiny world. I'll go back soon to shoot more. You can find more of my work on my [website](https://www.albertdros.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/albertdrosphotography).

TL/DR at the bottom for those not wanting to wade through the fiasco.\n\nQuick backstory. I have a full time day job where I shoot video and stills for a company. I shoot fine art, fashion, editorial images outside of that job as a hobby. This was one of my for-fun, hobby shoots. At the end of the day, I'm more passionate about my hobby work as it's a much purer form of self-expression than my day job. \n\nOnward. \n\nI reached out to a contact that I've worked with previously on a commercial shoot, asking if she'd like to work together soon. Got a reply back right away with her being super stoked, said she'd been meaning to reach out to me and then sent along a bunch of creative inspirational images to get our gears turning. Included in those shots were some stunning fine art, abstract nude poses in nature, on rocks, in the woods, etc. We're fortunate to live in Sonoma County, so access to redwoods and big coastal rock formations is here at our finger tips. \n\nWe set our shoot date, continued to plan out the details and this last Sunday we both drove out to the coast and shot together for over four hours. Oh boy, we both pushed ourselves creatively too, working in the rain, cold, bugs, wet gear, soggy clothing, slippery rocks, hiking - all while really observing the landscape and features seeing how we could work her poses into what mother nature presented. I'm sure that sounds cheesy, but our creative wave lengths were in sync the entire time. She was often the one pulling the shots too, with my being there to make her vision to come to life. \n\nSunset came and went, blue hour set in and we headed back to our cars and the day was over. It was one of those shoots were you felt exhausted by the work and also completely energized by how smoothly it all went. There's so much less negative struggle involved when you find compatible, creative people that just get it and are helping to drive a shoot forward. \n\nThe images are stunning and I was STOKED to share. This is some of my best work, and I've been shooting people/models for about 15-years. Nothing about this shoot felt cheap, no shortcuts were taken and my hope was that these images would inspire future work by attracting other like-minded people to want to work with me. Hopes were REALLY high at this point. \n\nThis morning I fired off the gallery link to the model and got a reply back a few hours later. She explained how she loved the images, showed them to her partner who then went on a big rant about how he wasn't comfortable with the world seeing her nude, even censored. They got into a huge fight, and in the end she buckled to his fears to save the peace and agreed that they'd never see the light of day. \n\nGuess it's been a rough couple of days for her since the shoot, and it's not my place to say how two people should be together in a relationship. While on our shoot we were both chatting about how great it was to have supportive partners that each give us the trust to express ourselves creatively, but she said this shoot took him past some breaking point. From what I gather, they're already going through a rocky period and this shoot just really upset the apple cart. By the end of our chat, it was clear he has a lot of growing to do (in her own words). It was less about the images themselves and more to do with spending the day nude, with another man, with his viewpoint being that it's simply impossible that the experience wasn't somehow sexual and that the images won't be interpreted as being sexual. If he were to stumble onto these images, it would \"hit a sore spot\" so it's better to not post them at all.\n\nObviously I can't share the images, but if you look at [David Hanagan's IG feed](https://www.instagram.com/davidhanagan/), you can get a sense of what we shot, but with less of that faded IG look and even more dramatic surroundings. \n\nSome of the shots were with her in bodysuit and many had all her private areas completely hidden with the pose and/or with the landscape. Honestly, she has more revealing photos of herself in bikinis \"out on the lake\" or while hiking on her feed. Again, not the images but more to do with his insecurities. I feel like this shoot put the two of them at a pretty big crossroads, and that they were already headed in that direction anyway... \n\nSo what could I have done differently? Ah, some of you are probably already foaming at the mouth wanting to type, \"So idiot, this is why you have had her sign a release.\" I hear ya, but I'm not the kind of person that would leverage a release or contract over another person's head in this type of circumstance. Doing that would be a total dick move, it would make her situation worse and I'd ruin a few connected friendships in the process. \n\nIn the end she rightfully has taken complete responsibility for how this all turned out. She completely misjudged how her partner would react and in the end that relationship is more important than the images and my time. I get that. Could she have offered some money to make up for my time? Sure! However she didn't offer and through our LONG ass chats, it's clear she's going through some shit right now and I'm not really in need of any extra cash. Again, we've got some close mutual friends and keeping the peace is my #1 priority at this point. \n\nShe's now offering to let me use some of the images on my website, un-credited, so there's a small win.  \n\nAnyone else experience anything like this? Feels good to get this out in writing. \n\nTL/DR - Model sets up a shoot, comes up with the idea for a nude-based \"forms in nature\" style shoot, Images turn out GREAT, I'm beyond stoked, can't wait to share. Model loves them, causes big issues with sig-other, now I can't use the images on IG because he's an immature man-child who can't see nudity as being non-sexual.

But sometimes the smaller things can be just as impressive. In this little article I\u2019ll be I am giving some tips to you Redditers to hopefully give you some inspiration when photographing abstracts. And when you start to see them, you can\u2019t stop photographing them. It\u2019s very addicting!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Look down.\n\nWe tend to look forward and see the bigger picture. But beauty is often just at our feet. Go low to the ground and look down occasionally. You\u2019ll find all kinds of interesting things. Think of textures on stones, lines little plants, patterns, contrast. Lots of interesting abstract shapes can be found on the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A simple mud cracks pattern](https://preview.redd.it/ke5i10j4qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf445712636425af84d3357796a4dd5d3b1dc678)\n\n[Autumn vegetation on the ground](https://preview.redd.it/6wb7k3q6qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c0b7c9371ff213fab85e668a53f3b446da78d1e)\n\n2. You don't need a macro lens.\n\nAbstract landscapes can be shot with any kind of lens. I usually shoot them with a 24-70 (close focus is a pre) or sometimes a longer lens to capture patterns in the distance.\n\n[Black sand ripples caused by the tide in Iceland](https://preview.redd.it/ygm7yhf9qxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b266d6823541a0b3f913124267ee8b5f4f4784d0)\n\n3. Look at lines\n\nWhen looking at subjects, find lines and try to balance them in your frame. Lines going from a corner into the frame often work well. Flowing lines also give a nice feel to an image.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Interesting lines and textures on a hill in Iceland](https://preview.redd.it/1sgv7aibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff7b15c14aa0cf728ffae3329cfbd2918da011d6)\n\n[Grassy hills in Kyrgyzstan](https://preview.redd.it/av1g1bibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973d3f010894ea66be98a24a63ea65bd116c8a31)\n\n[Lines on a piece of ice going from bright to dark](https://preview.redd.it/da3krbibqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7076b84a57688758ef1ab1407e2ceeeaeb57147e)\n\n4. Look at color contrast\n\nA combination of 2 Colors or dark and bright tones often work well in abstracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A combination of colour contrast and lines on a close up of a house in Burano, Venice.](https://preview.redd.it/uln6oufmqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be064e264cbc6d811a8f9442a6df97878aa54f0)\n\n[Little sand bumps hit by the sun turn to gold.

Lose perspective and scale. This has to do with looking at the smaller things in the \u2018bigger\u2019 picture again. When photographing abstracts its important to not show the surrounding. This way the viewer has no idea about the scale and perspective. When you photograph a sand texture the right way for example, it can look like a desert from above. It\u2019s fun to trick the viewer and let them think about your photo.\n\n[This could be an image of a desert shot from a plane, but its actually just a shot of some sand ripples shot with a 24-70 lens.](https://preview.redd.it/t0hlbi3qqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a4a67771d18590308c15f486b137935ee1aec4d)\n\n6. Find single objects in negative space\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Showing a lot of emptiness in the frame with a small subject gives a nice abstract look.](https://preview.redd.it/7zqcsirrqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd3676dbd6119b370420b226718cca62b8c290d4)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jd0g2h5tqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0eec8ede35df559dd5f189f1ca89327037b88ea\n\n7. Go to the beach! The beach often has lots of sand textures. Especially when the tide is low you can find patterns in the sand everywhere. They sometimes look like aerials and completely let the viewer lose perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A sand texture hit from the side by sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/0fq32u4vqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7552178819c8ba2a8498241ab0b66e8bc2f688ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Water. Water by itself is just incredible. Think of falling water from a waterfall or just the tap at home! Falling water in different strengths creates beautiful pattern. When photograph falling water, use an extremely fast shutter speed (1/1000 or faster) and just shoot away. You\u2019ll see you come up with lots of interesting shots! But not only falling water. Also ripples in the sea can create interesting photos depending on how the waves are and how the light hits. And then there is frozen water. Frozen water creates cracks and interesting ice textures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dropping water from a waterfall](https://preview.redd.it/jirtikiyqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed3cc5f934c7d1ed57e4c77901ecbd2c578de50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Waves](https://preview.redd.it/qbt9w6uzqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9df7d66b1dcd725c47865fd099667162e200fe)\n\n[A frozen piece of ice from up close looks like a hallucination pattern](https://preview.redd.it/nrtsh9mwqxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ead1a46e24dbd28a1bb8a12dd71b5dc2a7a27ff)\n\n[Shapes in a frozen puddle](https://preview.redd.it/7dazc9t0rxd41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c11e44d2a7cb2fc77fd9899d5d9e5845523e6ab)\n\n9. Harsh light and shadows.\n\nHarsh light during the day is often not great for landscape photography. But for abstracts it can be great. By playing with shapes and lines in harsh shadows you can sometimes create interesting abstract looks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img fhz6we44rxd41...*\n\n10 Look up close. Abstract landscapes are everywhere. You just have to learn to see them. Textures in stones, lines in plants, clouds. The trick is to look closely.

Even though I do not use pixel editors much, and did not have enough time to trial, I just bought it and kept it aside to see if it can help me. After using for a few weeks, I felt it will be good to share a user review.\n\n**Elephant in the room:**\n\nBefore I begin, I do not use any Adobe products and hence there will be no comparisons. While I will discuss some aspects with regards to other tools, I want to be sure you may feel free to add any corrections towards any reference without prejudice.\n\n\n**RAW Editor vs Pixel Editor:**\n\nI have been pretty much using RAW editors for a long time and my Go-To tools are Capture NX-D, darktable, RawTherapee, DXO and recently Capture One Express. As you can see, I do not stick to one tool and I like to play around tools. \ndarktable is my primary Raw editor and most of the pixel level edits can be simply done within dt. But for anything more, I use Gimp for layers, a bit of masking and that is about it. So my experience with pixel editors is extremely limited. However, I have used Photoshop when I was in school and the good thing about using darktable is you learn a lot of underlying logic, rather than one button/slider that does things for you. So, I cannot rate myself a beginner but more an intermediate user of Affinity right off the bat.\n\n**What I like:**\n\nThis tool is fast and almost makes me feel like everything I used is slow.\nIt feels like one of those new age tools that are built in this millennium. You open a brush and hover over, it will show a real-time preview. If you open a curves layer, you can go back and adjust which layer it will impact and how much opacity you need, or even turn off background layers to better see what result will look good. All this while still having the curves adjustment layer open and ready to take changes.\nYou can plan around and make almost all changes non-destructive within the file. Want to apply blur and then reduce it later, possible. Want to double the sharpening and then reduce it by 75%, simple. Changed your mind and want to localize sharpening again. There is no concept of smart objects, just change the adjustment layers and it is all done.\nBy default, all adjustment layers are full opacity mask layers, so saves a lot of time if you want any further adjustments.\nHandling of tif and jpeg colors is nice. I know this is a strange thing to say, but coming from Raw editors, it is a high bar for pixel editors, and I like colors from AFP quite a lot. (It is not the same for Raw files)\nThe selection tool is just to the point and very good and the in-paining tool (similar but not as powerful as content aware in PS) is a nifty tool that saves a lot of clicks. Gradient tool is easy to use again, you can make it editable via fx options.\n\n\n**What I do not like:**\n\nThe brush preview sometimes could be delayed, which means you will brush on areas that are not intended as the effect will appear later.\nThe RAW editor is sub-par. It is not even user friendly. Perhaps a dead give-away that Affinity will come up with a Lightroom competitor and want to keep the Raw editor rather limited. This is not a deal breaker for me as I have plenty of Raw editors, and as I play around, I realize it is capable.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nI paid the 50% discount price and I am yet to wrap my head around the fact, people are not jumping over this tool for full price.

How do I change this? /!/ I started photography about 6 months back and bought a Mirrorless camera about 4 months back. Initially started with street and landscape and after doing it for 3 or a bit more months I started doing portraits for a number of reasons. I feel I like it much more (the story may be a post in itself and not really relevant to the discussion) and would like to get really good in this field (I know it must take a lot of time). I must say that I have a day job so photography isn't something I depend on for money and that is why I think I have full freedom to explore this area without caring about the monetary side of things.\n\nSo far I am just taking pics of pretty girls. And without sounding cheesy, cliched or a pervert I would say that my idea is to capture female beauty since it really fascinates me. Some photographers that inspire me are Dubnistkiy, Ana Dias, Haris Nukem. \n\nAfter shooting portraits for about 2 months (all outdoor shoots in my city) I feel like every shoot of mine is now getting repetitive. Repetitive in the sense that I end up having less and less variety in my pics with each shoot. I especially realized this in the last shoot when I was just standing not sure of what to do. Moreover, I feel that I am unable to come up with something unique and my pics end up looking like so many others on Instagram. I have posted my pics on other subreddits (with a different account) here and some have got a lot of appreciation so I don't think I am necessarily taking bad pics. \n\nBut I feel that I am not able to come up with something unique or develop a style. Constrained by my sorroundings I am also not able to do lots of things that I would like to do. For example, I live in a big city so my themes so far have been all urban in nature. There are some parks here but parks seem artificial and I would like shooting in more natural locations say a farm, near the sea or something else. When I travel I would do those things but at the moment what I am unable to fix is a lack of creativity.\n\nI don't want to just be a guy with a camera who is taking pics of pretty girls since so many are doing that.

Right now my photography gear consists of a Mirrorless camera and a prime lens 85mm F1.8 (and 2 kit lenses which I don't use now).\n\nSo what should I do next?\n\n1. Buy more gear?

When taking photos myself, I was just a point and shoot kinda guy, not paying any attention whatsoever to subject, composition, light, etc.\n\nThis changed about 2 years ago, when I started to follow a few landscape photographers on youtube, and started to try to take photographs (landscape) more intentionally, trying to use what I learned from watching the videos. I never did anything artistic or even creative before in my life really, I was always a technical person.\n\nWhen I hear photographers talk about their photographs, they often mention feelings and vision, and stuff like this, which is very strange for my technical mind. I never have any vision, or feel anything (well, apart from enjoying myself) when I'm taking photos, I feel like my main motivation is that I just want to take nice pictures that look pretty.

The title is the best I could come up with at the time.\n\nI'm a landscape photographer and I've been doing photography for almost 4 years, and I still love it. I don't travel a huge amount (especially not lately) so I mostly take photographs of my local area and a bit of the coast. They're not grand epic landscapes but nice enough to practice with at least, but quite light dependent.\n\nOver time my style has changed quite rapidly, if you compare each 6 month intervals there's a noticeable difference. When I say style I'm not talking IG filters or the like, although processing obviously plays a bit part in it. But I also mean the sort of subjects I'm drawn to, compositions and lighting etc.\n\nOne main problem I feel like I'm facing right now is what I'd perhaps describe as inspiration overload. I like a lot of different photographers, and I like looking at a lot of different types of phorographs. And many of them all have their own unique look and style. I think you'd perhaps agree that photographers such as Ryan Dyar ([https://www.ryandyar.com/mountains](https://www.ryandyar.com/mountains)) has a different style to Albert Dros ([https://www.albertdros.com/world-landscapes](https://www.albertdros.com/world-landscapes)) who also has a different style to Neil Burnell ([https://www.neilburnell.com/gallery](https://www.neilburnell.com/gallery)). They're all great and to be honest I like them quite equally. I picked these 3 as just examples.\n\nBecause of this I feel like I'm a bit torn as to where I think my own photography is heading or where I want it to go. One moment I feel like I'm drawn to a more bright, colourful and dramatic look and other times I feel a bit more drawn to a kind of dark, moody and more subtle colour pallet. I guess this comes hand in hand with mood and whether I want to represent my own personality, or a world that I want to see. I don't know if this is normal or whether others have experienced something similar but it's where I am right now. In the 4 years I've been doing photography so far I don't think I've nailed a direction and feeling to my own photography, and that's why I feel a bit lost.\n\nI think this is made especially worse as I often find myself comparing my own images to others.

Eagles can be found there frequently, but they are still a hard find other than getting one in a remote tree. My last trip out a few weeks ago was \"Great Blue Heron Day\", with over 30 chilling on the far bank and usually a couple in the air fishing. The Osprey traffic has been increasing as well based on other photographers who frequent the location. The spot is popular. There were 7-8 other photographers there yesterday.\n\nIt was Osprey day.

Wide area AF works pretty well. The lens focuses fast enough (could be better). The TC-14E doesn't seem to slow things down much.\n\nIn 677 photos, I pitched 122 of them for being obviously out of focus, most of the bird out of the frame, accidents, birds flying behind trees... you know the junk. I would guess 100 of them were clearly out of focus. That's about an 85% hit rate, which I guess isn't that bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Osprey in flight.

Perhaps some were the TC. Many of them show the red focus blocks not on the bird. And this is where my frustration started. The camera really seemed to want to lock on to background elements, rocks, trees, etc. Of course, a small bird against contrasty trees and rocks is going to frustrate any AF system. My lasts trip was a foggy, gray, overcast day. Yesterday was bright and sunny and lots of contrast. I tried different combinations of focus modes. I tried focus tracking, but trying to handhold that beast of a lens and activate focus tracking while the bird is a real challenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Juvenile Red-tail Hawk - 1\\/800 f\\/5.6 ISO 200 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/enkucl07e7r61.jpg?width=1927&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc4ec58b7f601cd1f8ee350e01b070b10d46e427)\n\nTo make matters worse, many of the birds were pretty much above me. Trying to shoot that combination with the lens pointing straight up really stressed out my left arm. Many of my \"out of frame\" shots were with the bird more overhead.\n\nI had a significant amount of motion blur too. Even with VR in the lens, IBIS in the body and Auto ISO on giving me a handholdable shutter speed, they were just bad.\n\nWith the lighting, it was a challenge to see the LCD on the back.

Had I just set the ISO up to something reasonable like ISO 800 which the camera can easily do, I would have had higher shutter speeds. Auto ISO doesn't want to give me much more than one stop more than 1/focal length.\n* Trying to shoot things over my head where I don't have the upper body strenght to do so. You have to bend over backwards which creates an unbalanced platform.\n* Not enough expereience trying to pan with that lens. Maybe if I had a gimble head and a steady tripod I might be better, or use a monopod. The monopod doesn't provide any vertical flexibility though and the gimble head only gives you some vertical access without you having to squat.\n* I can't move the camera well enough to make subject tracking work.\n* Panning while trying to fill the frame is a challenge.\n\nI wonder if the 500mm f/5.6 PF lens, being almost 2 pounds lighter and I suspect faster AF would make my life better? It's only 3 ounces heavier than the 70-200 f/2.8... Maybe I should get this instead of replacing my 70-200 f/2.8 F mount. I shoot a lot of stuff at 500mm.\n\nOn a good note, the 677 photos consumed two pips of battery. Since the last charge, I've shot 780 photos and have 37% left. That works out to about 1200 shots on a charge.\n\nDo I hate my Z 6II? Absolutly not. I love the camera. Do I hate the 200-500 f/5.6.

I am only a hobbyist and I don\u2019t rely on photography as a source of income. I take mostly travel and street photography with some landscape and portrait that naturally occur while on travel. I have 2 main reasons why I want a new lens - 1st is low light performance. One example was when I was on a dinner cruise and couldn\u2019t capture any photos without bumping the ISO up to 6400. I really think a fast Prime lens would have helped a lot in this case. 2nd is focal length although this might have been more situational. We went to an open zoo/reserve and 55mm was nowhere near enough to capture the animals and shows the way I wanted to. Here I feel like a longer zoom would have helped tremendously. On further reflection though, how often do I really go on zoos or watch theatrical performances from a distance - probably not so much. Then again, having the option of having a lens with a long focal length would be good to have.\n\nI am also struggling between the old Prime vs. Zoom argument. I do feel like I should get a Prime for both the practical aspects as well as for improving my own skill by being locked to a fixed focal point but I feel like I was \u201cspoiled\u201d by starting with a zoom lens and I feel like I would miss quite a lot of shots if I were to use a Prime.\n\nI really want something to compliment the 18-55 rather than replace it as I really love the lens. After a lot of research and thinking, I have come up with the following options in order of what I think is best for my situation:\n\n1. XC 35mm F2 and Viltrox 85mm F1.8 - 2 lenses for the price of 1 XF lens. Both are very fast lenses and from what I\u2019ve read are very sharp. The only negatives here are neither are XF lenses and both are Primes but those aren\u2019t really a negative.\n\n2. XF 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 - A zoom lens that would compliment the 18-55 beautifully. Negative is it\u2019s a zoom so it\u2019s not as fast or as sharp as Primes. Also I don\u2019t get any low light advantages a Prime would provide.\n\n3. XF 16mm F1.4 - Lots of good reviews for this lens, the 16mm and F1.4 as well as super close min focus distance allow for a lot of creative and unique shots which I do wish to learn and experience. The big negative for this lens is it\u2019s not very versatile. Super wide angle requires a lot of shot composition and no classic/lazy flattering portrait shots allowed. For landscape I feel the 18mm on the kit would also work similarly to this lens especially since the F1.4 aperture wouldn\u2019t matter in this case though I could be wrong.\n\n4. XF 50-140mm F2.8 - This one is the red badge monster and a big part of me wanting this feels more emotional than anything practical. Feels like the opposite of my 1st option which is the most practical but less \u201cexciting\u201d option.\n\n5. 23mm F2 or 35mm F2 - The most common all-rounders. I just feel like the kit lens does well enough @23mm and the existence of the XC 35mm F2 for half the price really makes these lenses a tough buy for me.\n\nThese are my options.

I am only a hobbyist and I don\u2019t rely on photography as a source of income. I take mostly travel and street photography with some landscape and portrait that naturally occur while on travel. I have 2 main reasons why I want a new lens - 1st is low light performance. One example was when I was on a dinner cruise and couldn\u2019t capture any photos without bumping the ISO up to 6400. I really think a fast Prime lens would have helped a lot in this case. 2nd is focal length although this might have been more situational. We went to an open zoo/reserve and 55mm was nowhere near enough to capture the animals and shows the way I wanted to. Here I feel like a longer zoom would have helped tremendously. On further reflection though, how often do I really go on zoos or watch theatrical performances from a distance - probably not so much. Then again, having the option of having a lens with a long focal length would be good to have.\n\nI am also struggling between the old Prime vs. Zoom argument. I do feel like I should get a Prime for both the practical aspects as well as for improving my own skill by being locked to a fixed focal point but I feel like I was \u201cspoiled\u201d by starting with a zoom lens and I feel like I would miss quite a lot of shots if I were to use a Prime.\n\nI really want something to compliment the 18-55 rather than replace it as I really love the lens. After a lot of research and thinking, I have come up with the following options in order of what I think is best for my situation:\n\n1. XC 35mm F2 and Viltrox 85mm F1.8 - 2 lenses for the price of 1 XF lens. Both are very fast lenses and from what I\u2019ve read are very sharp. The only negatives here are neither are XF lenses and both are Primes but those aren\u2019t really a negative.\n\n2. XF 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 - A zoom lens that would compliment the 18-55 beautifully. Negative is it\u2019s a zoom so it\u2019s not as fast or as sharp as Primes. Also I don\u2019t get any low light advantages a Prime would provide.\n\n3. XF 16mm F1.4 - Lots of good reviews for this lens, the 16mm and F1.4 as well as super close min focus distance allow for a lot of creative and unique shots which I do wish to learn and experience. The big negative for this lens is it\u2019s not very versatile. Super wide angle requires a lot of shot composition and no classic/lazy flattering portrait shots allowed. For landscape I feel the 18mm on the kit would also work similarly to this lens especially since the F1.4 aperture wouldn\u2019t matter in this case though I could be wrong.\n\n4. XF 50-140mm F2.8 - This one is the red badge monster and a big part of me wanting this feels more emotional than anything practical. Feels like the opposite of my 1st option which is the most practical but less \u201cexciting\u201d option.\n\n5. 23mm F2 or 35mm F2 - The most common all-rounders. I just feel like the kit lens does well enough @23mm and the existence of the XC 35mm F2 for half the price really makes these lenses a tough buy for me.\n\nThese are my options. If you were in my situation, what would you get? Feel free to recommend other lenses as well. Another thing I might have glanced over is budget, I am willing to shell out as long as it gives the best results for the money It costs.\n\nSorry for the long post, if you have made it this far, thanks for your time and advice!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/fgfdwe/fujifilm_xt30_lens_recommendations/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "fujifilm x-t30 lens recommendations? /!/ trouble deciding what should be my 1st lens for my fujifilm x-t30 after the xf 18-55 f2.8-4.\n\ni know lenses are subjective and it\u2019s hard to recommend one so i will try to explain my needs as best as i can, so please bare with me.\n\ni absolutely love the kit lens and the sharpness and versatility it provides. i am only a hobbyist and i don\u2019t rely on photography as a source of income. i take mostly travel and street photography with some landscape and portrait that naturally occur while on travel. i have 2 main reasons why i want a new lens - 1st is low light performance. one example was when i was on a dinner cruise and couldn\u2019t capture any photos without bumping the iso up to 6400. i really think a fast prime lens would have helped a lot in this case. 2nd is focal length although this might have been more situational. we went to an open zoo/reserve and 55mm was nowhere near enough to capture the animals and shows the way i wanted to. here i feel like a longer zoom would have helped tremendously. on further reflection though, how often do i really go on zoos or watch theatrical performances from a distance - probably not so much. then again, having the option of having a lens with a long focal length would be good to have.\n\ni am also struggling between the old prime vs. zoom argument. i do feel like i should get a prime for both the practical aspects as well as for improving my own skill by being locked to a fixed focal point but i feel like i was \u201cspoiled\u201d by starting with a zoom lens and i feel like i would miss quite a lot of shots if i were to use a prime.\n\ni really want something to compliment the 18-55 rather than replace it as i really love the lens. after a lot of research and thinking, i have -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  the following options in order of what i think is best for my situation:\n\n1. xc 35mm f2 and viltrox 85mm f1.8 - 2 lenses for the price of 1 xf lens. both are very fast lenses and from what i\u2019ve read are very sharp. the only negatives here are neither are xf lenses and both are primes but those aren\u2019t really a negative.\n\n2. xf 55-200mm f3.5-4.8 - a zoom lens that would compliment the 18-55 beautifully. negative is it\u2019s a zoom so it\u2019s not as fast or as sharp as primes. also i don\u2019t get any low light advantages a prime would provide.\n\n3. xf 16mm f1.4 - lots of good reviews for this lens, the 16mm and f1.4 as well as super close min focus distance allow for a lot of creative and unique shots which i do wish to learn and experience. the big negative for this lens is it\u2019s not very versatile. super wide angle requires a lot of shot composition and no classic/lazy flattering portrait shots allowed. for landscape i feel the 18mm on the kit would also work similarly to this lens especially since the f1.4 aperture wouldn\u2019t matter in this case though i could be wrong.\n\n4. xf 50-140mm f2.8 - this one is the red badge monster and a big part of me wanting this feels more emotional than anything practical. feels like the opposite of my 1st option which is the most practical but less \u201cexciting\u201d option.\n\n5. 23mm f2 or 35mm f2 - the most common all-rounders. i just feel like the kit lens does well enough @23mm and the existence of the xc 35mm f2 for half the price really makes these lenses a tough buy for me.\n\nthese are my options. if you were in my situation, what would you get? feel free to recommend other lenses as well. another thing i might have glanced over is budget, i am willing to shell out as long as it gives the best results for the money it costs.\n\nsorry for the long post, if you have made it this far, thanks for your time and advice!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 1560, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Robonellz", "date": "2020-01-13 07:35:51", "content": "Olympus OM-D EM10 ii -VS- Nikon D3500 /!/ I\u2019m looking for a smaller lightweight capable digital camera under $500.

Thoughts? /!/ Looking at the market there seem to be two approaches, the MASP selection and fuji's dedicated dials each featuring an A option. Both having some advantages as some disadvantages.\n\nThere also 3 distinct setting scenarios.  \nThe full automatic, point and shoot experience, ideal for amateur users or more lighthearted momments such as a family party.  \nFull manual, optimal for studio work, flash use, long exposure and cases where speed and losing the moment arent such important factors as absolute control over the settings.  \nHaving most possible control over the settings while still relying on some automation to achive the fast and snappy workflow that manual doesnt offer. This also means that camera would preferably have to control only one parameter at a time.\n\nThe priority modes come from the film era where iso was a fixed value so there where only two changable parameters.

The answer is simple.  \nInstead of choosing the most importnt parameter to control (which almost always is the aperture), you should have to choose the less important parameter to be the one set to auto. While obviously still retaining the option of full manual and auto.\n\nFuji's interface offers a similar logic, but since professionals rarely have two parameters set to auto, to change the automated parameter from one to another, say from only auto speed to only auto iso.

In the case of moving subjects, your setting would be something like, widest f stop, and slowest possible speed that would still be able to freeze the action (according to your focal length) and auto iso.

I am interested in switching to Sony and I'm trying to find what suits me the most. I'd love to read your input!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy photographic profile can be split in 3 main categories.\n\n1. Generic/travel photography: Currently I'm mainly using a Canon 700d with a 17-55 2.8 IS. Excellent combo but I'd like to get something smaller. After analyzing the exif from my previous photos, I found out that almost 30% of them are shot at the widest end. When I want to be more discreet/save some space, I use the 24mm f/2.8 pancake. Absolutely love the size of this lens!\n2. Sports photography. Mainly car racing. I use a 70-200 2.8 unstabilized. Nothing to moan about here except the somehow slow burst rate of my camera. I've also used my dad's 100-400 for extra reach. Nice lens but the miss ratio increases with that one.\n3. Low-light shots (like concerts), portraits. I use my dad's 5D mkii  with some manual lenses like a Leica 50 f/2 and a Zeiss 85 1.4. Love the results!\n\nNow, suppose I want to find a combo that can cover these 3 categories in a more compact package with better image quality as well!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came up with three options as \"starter packs\", but I'm open to other ideas.\n\na. The \"decent aps-c\" solution: Sony A6500 + Sigma 16mm f/1.4 + Sigma 30mm f/1.4 = \\~1500 euro\n\nb. The \"cheap ff\" solution: Sony A7 iii + Sony 28mm f/2 = \\~2300 euro\n\nc. The \"all in ff\" solution: Sony A7 iii + Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2 +Sony 50mm f/1.8 = \\~3050 euro\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question**: is option c worth the x2 price compared to option a? I know the answer depends on a lot of things, but I would like to hear your thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Future upgrades**\n\nNext step for sports photography: Sony 100-400mm.

I like to write short useful articles and I just came up with this one. This may all sound quite basic but I feel like I need to point this out because I see so much of the same stuff online. I want to encourage people to be creative, even if it\u2019s just for the sake of trying something new or different. \n\nThis article is both for beginners and advanced landscape photographers. I figured I\u2019d list some tips to hopefully give you some inspiration and give you some new options to try out in your landscape photography. With the era of social media I notice a lot of people just copy photos they see on Facebook or Instagram. This happens to me a lot. I always try to be creative and find \u2018new\u2019 angles myself. For some people getting creative comes naturally, but others will need a bit of a push. This article will hopefully help :) Here are 10 tips that will hopefully be helpful to get that bit of extra in your shots.\n\n1) Most landscape photos are shot with wide lenses. I love wide lenses myself, but try a telezoom once and experiment with long focal lengths of 100-300+. Try photographing patterns or small details in landscapes. Or try it in the mountains on mountain tops. Once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll notice a whole new world of landscape photography opens. Seriously, try it.\n\n[Green Hills close up at 300mm](https://i.imgur.com/Tsjk3v5.jpg)\n\n2) Play with motion. Clouds move, water moves. Try to create dynamics in your frame by the use of moving water or clouds. You can do this by using long or short shutter speeds. You can make use of filters to create longer exposures, or create drama with very short exposures. Always experiment with different lengths of exposure with both clouds and water.\n\n[Short exposure to capture drama](https://i.imgur.com/cNqqXYl.jpg)\n\n[Long exposure of the same scene with a different composition to create a totally different mood](https://i.imgur.com/yOh6pLL.jpg)\n\n3) Experiment with a CPL filter. I have done landscape photography without a CPL filter for years. But once you have one, you start to see why it can be so useful in different cases. It can be especially useful to control the amount of sunlight and reflection on reflective surfaces. You simply can\u2019t do this in post production.\n\n[Example of Rotating CPL effect on reflective surface](https://media.giphy.com/media/1o1u6VbxA54uBMCMlc/giphy.gif)\n\n4) When photographing with longer lenses use layers and compression. Landscapes look totally different with long lenses and you can compress foreground and background objects to give a lot of depth in your photo. \n\n[Compressed Road shot at 135mm](https://i.imgur.com/vrRBVGd.jpg)\n\n[Including a person with a long lens shot at 200mm](https://i.imgur.com/OZYvTbU.jpg)\n\n5) Use light to your advantage. Light always changes especially during sunsets and sunrises. Look for details here and isolated objects by light. This happens a lot in the mountains where clouds and light play around peaks go on during the whole day. \n\n[First Morning Light hitting a mountain peak](https://i.imgur.com/yI0maQn.jpg)\n\n6) When shooting with wide angles, get very close to objects to create a lot of depth in your photo. With \u2018very close\u2019 I mean VERY close. So close that your lens almost touches the foreground object. This can be a flower, a plant, or anything. You can use focus stacking to get everything in focus, or choose to pick a very wide open aperture to get the foreground completely out of focus/blurry. Both choices offer different looks and can both be used in nice ways.\n\n[Getting very low and close with Out of Focus foreground](https://i.imgur.com/xZQ3bLL.jpg)\n\n[Getting very low with focus stacking](https://i.imgur.com/cq7euyj.jpg)\n\n7) Make use of sunstars in your composition. When shooting directly in to the sun and closing down your aperture to f/16-f/22 you will see that your lens will create a sunstar. Different lenses have different characteristics. Some lenses create beautiful sunstars and you may want to make use of them. Position the sun against an edge, like the horizon or just an object in the frame. By positioning it slightly against an edge, the sunstars will look best. Try and experiment!\n\n[f/22 sunstar with the sun peaking just over the treeline](https://i.imgur.com/T3fxCrA.jpg)\n\n[Sun just touching the edge of an object to create a sunstar](https://i.imgur.com/tb42rPC.jpg)\n\n8) Learn how to shoot with extreme wide angle lenses and fisheye lenses. By extreme wide I mean wider than 14mm (full frame equivalent). Photographing at 10-12mm or wider with fisheye lenses give you a whole new perspective to a landscape. It opens up lots of (creative) possibilities. Learn the \u2018defish\u2019 technique also that makes it possible to create an undistorted shot out of a fisheye shot (not going to describe the technique here, but can be found online. I also have a Youtube tutorial about it). This can be extremely useful for photographing very wide landscapes.\n\n[Vertigo shot with 180 degree fisheye and corrupted with lens profile](https://i.imgur.com/TXya83Y.jpg)\n\n\n[Wide scene shot with 12mm fisheye 180 degrees, corrected so no distortion appears](https://i.imgur.com/Uzi8Pjr.jpg)\n\n9) Don\u2019t always immediately take your camera out and look for potential frames. Walk around in nature and use your eyes. Try to visualise how things would look through your camera. I also often use my smartphone, which has an around 20mm field of view. Simply to check framing.\n\n[random spot I found next to the road](https://i.imgur.com/yskqooz.jpg)\n\n10) Last, this may sound very obvious but it\u2019s important to train your eye nonstop. Look around you everywhere and try to see potential compositions in every day life. This may sounds hard and being a landscape photographer can be very tiring because of the nonstop possibilities nature offers. You train your eye by using a wide array of lenses so that you know how things will look through an extreme zoom lens, or how things would look with an extreme wide angle.\n\n[Cold Morning, Just looking around](https://i.imgur.com/DdeHidC.jpg)\n\n\nHope these were useful.

professional landscape photographer from the netherlands. i like to write short useful articles and i just -----> came !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  this one. this may all sound quite basic but i feel like i need to point this out because i see so much of the same stuff online. i want to encourage people to be creative, even if it\u2019s just for the sake of trying something new or different. \n\nthis article is both for beginners and advanced landscape photographers. i figured i\u2019d list some tips to hopefully give you some inspiration and give you some new options to try out in your landscape photography. with the era of social media i notice a lot of people just copy photos they see on facebook or instagram. this happens to me a lot. i always try to be creative and find \u2018new\u2019 angles myself. for some people getting creative comes naturally, but others will need a bit of a push. this article will hopefully help :) here are 10 tips that will hopefully be helpful to get that bit of extra in your shots.\n\n1) most landscape photos are shot with wide lenses. i love wide lenses myself, but try a telezoom once and experiment with long focal lengths of 100-300+. try photographing patterns or small details in landscapes. or try it in the mountains on mountain tops. once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll notice a whole new world of landscape photography opens. seriously, try it.\n\n[green hills close up at 300mm](https://i.imgur.com/tsjk3v5.jpg)\n\n2) play with motion. clouds move, water moves. try to create dynamics in your frame by the use of moving water or clouds. you can do this by using long or short shutter speeds. you can make use of filters to create longer exposures, or create drama with very short exposures. always experiment with different lengths of exposure with both clouds and water.\n\n[short exposure to capture drama](https://i.imgur.com/cnqqxyl.jpg)\n\n[long exposure of the same scene with a different composition to create a totally different mood](https://i.imgur.com/yoh6pll.jpg)\n\n3) experiment with a cpl filter. i have done landscape photography without a cpl filter for years. but once you have one, you start to see why it can be so useful in different cases. it can be especially useful to control the amount of sunlight and reflection on reflective surfaces. you simply can\u2019t do this in post production.\n\n[example of rotating cpl effect on reflective surface](https://media.giphy.com/media/1o1u6vbxa54ubmcmlc/giphy.gif)\n\n4) when photographing with longer lenses use layers and compression. landscapes look totally different with long lenses and you can compress foreground and background objects to give a lot of depth in your photo. \n\n[compressed road shot at 135mm](https://i.imgur.com/vrrbvgd.jpg)\n\n[including a person with a long lens shot at 200mm](https://i.imgur.com/ozyvtbu.jpg)\n\n5) use light to your advantage. light always changes especially during sunsets and sunrises. look for details here and isolated objects by light. this happens a lot in the mountains where clouds and light play around peaks go on during the whole day. \n\n[first morning light hitting a mountain peak](https://i.imgur.com/yi0maqn.jpg)\n\n6) when shooting with wide angles, get very close to objects to create a lot of depth in your photo. with \u2018very close\u2019 i mean very close. so close that your lens almost touches the foreground object. this can be a flower, a plant, or anything. you can use focus stacking to get everything in focus, or choose to pick a very wide open aperture to get the foreground completely out of focus/blurry. both choices offer different looks and can both be used in nice ways.\n\n[getting very low and close with out of focus foreground](https://i.imgur.com/xzq3bll.jpg)\n\n[getting very low with focus stacking](https://i.imgur.com/cq7euyj.jpg)\n\n7) make use of sunstars in your composition. when shooting

They commisioned me to work on several different shots for a range of nail polishes they are looking to market. Again, I was put in charge of coming up with the creative angle and had the freedom to explore and execute the final result. The client was open to any suggestions or ideas, and I had fun putting it all together.\n\nMy vision was to keep the design simple yet unique and deeply orientated towards the brand and product on show. Nail polish bottles are generally a small object and require slightly different treatment than, say, photographing a large carry bag. The bottle needed to be centered and close up enough to capture the logo and brand name. Each bottle was cubed-shaped, with a matt-pastel color, the same as the gel nail polish inside. The lids (bottle tops) were long, frosted-gold colored. This color really illuminates the final image and casts long diagonal lines as the viewer follows it up.\n\n## The Setup and Using Splashes\n\nAs this project is not a single image, but rather a series of images, I tried to create something that flows like a story. After brainstorming and running through different ideas, I found a particular genre of still life photography to be most suitable. Splash is the art of capturing liquid in motion. Splash is a classic genre, and it is popular to take splash templates and use them as backgrounds or additions to your image. It does require some knowledge of Photoshop and other editing software to manipulate. I chose to create a splash specifically for this project, and not take advantage of an existing one from other artists.\n\nI experimented with several different liquids, from organic to synthetic mixtures. The mixture or liquid needed the consistency and fluidity to fit the brand and idea. Eventually, I settled with a classic, white acrylic wall paint. A water-based solution worked best for this project. Pouring the liquid by hand from a raised position into a container below, I hoped to capture interesting patterns. The setup was a standard white background positioned not far behind the table. On the table, I had a container to catch the paint as I poured it from above. I repeated this pouring step multiple times until I found some splashes worth editing and merging with the nail polish bottles. The products were shot individually. This particular project required more post-production editing than usual. Software like Photoshop was used to achieve the final results.\n\n## To End\n\nThe client and I agree that the final results are satisfying. The elegance of the brand complements the creativity and flow of the photograph. The online community expressed an interest in learning more about splash. As well as, praising the final results. Furthermore, the client originally made me withhold the results until they have rolled out the new marketing material.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9ra645/still_life_photography_of_nail_polish_in/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "coming up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "still life photography of nail polish in whirlpool of splash /!/ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykeeci1lvto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykeeci1lvto)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n![img](ca7yap710cu11)\n\n## the brief\n\nfor this project, i was tasked with creating hero images for a cosmetic brand. they commisioned me to work on several different shots for a range of nail polishes they are looking to market. again, i was put in charge of -----> coming !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  the creative angle and had the freedom to explore and execute the final result. the client was open to any suggestions or ideas, and i had fun putting it all together.\n\nmy vision was to keep the design simple yet unique and deeply orientated towards the brand and product on show. nail polish bottles are generally a small object and require slightly different treatment than, say, photographing a large carry bag. the bottle needed to be centered and close up enough to capture the logo and brand name. each bottle was cubed-shaped, with a matt-pastel color, the same as the gel nail polish inside. the lids (bottle tops) were long, frosted-gold colored. this color really illuminates the final image and casts long diagonal lines as the viewer follows it up.\n\n## the setup and using splashes\n\nas this project is not a single image, but rather a series of images, i tried to create something that flows like a story. after brainstorming and running through different ideas, i found a particular genre of still life photography to be most suitable. splash is the art of capturing liquid in motion. splash is a classic genre, and it is popular to take splash templates and use them as backgrounds or additions to your image. it does require some knowledge of photoshop and other editing software to manipulate. i chose to create a splash specifically for this project, and not take advantage of an existing one from other artists.\n\ni experimented with several different liquids, from organic to synthetic mixtures. the mixture or liquid needed the consistency and fluidity to fit the brand and idea. eventually, i settled with a classic, white acrylic wall paint. a water-based solution worked best for this project. pouring the liquid by hand from a raised position into a container below, i hoped to capture interesting patterns. the setup was a standard white background positioned not far behind the table. on the table, i had a container to catch the paint as i poured it from above. i repeated this pouring step multiple times until i found some splashes worth editing and merging with the nail polish bottles. the products were shot individually. this particular project required more post-production editing than usual. software like photoshop was used to achieve the final results.\n\n## to end\n\nthe client and i agree that the final results are satisfying. the elegance of the brand complements the creativity and flow of the photograph. the online community expressed an interest in learning more about splash. as well as, praising the final results. furthermore, the client originally made me withhold the results until they have rolled out the new marketing material.\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 17171, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "idkwidd", "date": "2018-03-06 07:56:53", "content": "Looking for some stories of people who have lost interest in photography, and picking it back up again. /!/ Photography was my number 1 hobby all of last year and absolutely enjoyed going out and taking pictures, and learning to get better with my camera.

This is basically around how I organise and plan my on-location shoots so that I can work to a location\u2019s strengths and ensure a successful shoot, as well as some example locations that are publicly accessible around my hometown, Sydney. This advice isn't for large commercial teams or projects - those will usually need permits. But if you\u2019re shooting light for creative/portfolio development, this advice may be right up your alley.\n\n\nI have to be quite flexible with the location for my shoots. I select a location based on one or more of the following factors: Shoot Style, Time of Day &amp; Geographical Area.\n\n\n**Shoot Style**\n\nThe style of shoot can be your biggest factor when selecting a location. This can include shooting for swim, street, activewear, or simply knowing you have to shoot at a particular location by request. If you\u2019re lucky though, you have creative control to influence this in some way. For example, swimwear may look just as good at a garden, beach house or pool and doesn\u2019t require a beach in sight. The more creative you are with your locations, the more interesting and novel your shoots could be.\n\n\nRecognise the strengths of different location types and adjust your shoot to take advantage of them. Keep a shortlist of locations that have worked for you so you\u2019re not starting from scratch for every shoot, which can be hard. I save my locations on Google Maps so I can review them when looking at the area I might look to shoot in. This is a godsend for me.\n\n\n**Time of Day**\n\nThis to me is the factor with the biggest impact on the look of your photos. When you don\u2019t have time to scout locations (and I don\u2019t), you can instead rely on a couple of great tools: Google Maps and [Suncalc](http://suncalc.net/). Suncalc overlays itself on Google Maps and shows you the arc of the sun throughout any day. It will give you a pretty good idea of where the sun will be, and based on the type of location you can use this to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for your aesthetic.\n\n\nFor example, shooting a late afternoon session on an east-facing beach will probably see you plunged into darkness well before sunset as the buildings cast a shadow over the whole beach. Using suncalc can instead help you find locations that might be facing more towards the sun and therefore get you more time to shoot (I use Vaucluse a lot for late afternoon shoots). Personally my favourite times of day are during sunrise and sunset so that I can get more interesting natural light punching through the shot, but that's just my style. When it comes to shooting inland, streetview and community-submitted photos are also your friend because buildings and elevation can limit the type of light you\u2019ll have and viewing the street imagery will help you see what you\u2019re in for.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a case to be made about shooting indoors - if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a place offered. I\u2019ve done a number of shoots in apartments and used the furnishings and decorations to modify the light and create some really great scenes. \n\n\nIf I\u2019m shooting when the sun is high in the sky, I look for man-made structures that can give me more interesting backgrounds, but can also shield myself and the model from the sun - or even act as a reflector to provide more even light. Fortunately the more limited you are the more creative you have to be. If you're struggling to find structures to help you, instead adjust poses to make use of the light. Embrace the harsh lighting! Focus instead on the leading lines, the shadows and the overall mood of the day that you and your model have control of.\n\n\n**Geographical Area**\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to address the location types available to you. If you live on the coast, you may have access to heaps of great beaches. If you live inland, not so much - but perhaps you can find a lake, lagoon, or pool if you need water. If you live in mountains and pick your time of day appropriately, you\u2019ll get some stunning images. I am fortunate to live in Sydney and have access to some of the greatest beach locations, but you\u2019ll find a lot of my work is shot all over Sydney or parkland a few hours out. Sometimes I just shoot down an alley. Check out your local tennis/basketball courts and book a slot when it\u2019s not busy. Use the colours and lines to your advantage.\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think you\u2019re limited by only having access to public spaces for shoots. But then I remember how I wouldn\u2019t have come up with a lot of the lighting, backdrops and poses without being challenged in the first place. Think critically about your surroundings - what types of public spaces are there? What about alleyways, or interesting homes? Rooftops, backyards, even carparks can all allow you to be creative and produce something amazing. Locations that I\u2019ve struggled with the most have yielded some of my favourite photos due to the unusual angles, lighting and backdrops that resulted from it.\n\n\n\n**TLDR:** Use Google Maps and [Suncalc](http://suncalc.net/).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/7ptpdu/making_locations_work_for_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "making locations work for you /!/ i wrote this on my website a few months ago, and thought it might be worth reposting here if it helps some new starters in portrait photography. this is basically around how i organise and plan my on-location shoots so that i can work to a location\u2019s strengths and ensure a successful shoot, as well as some example locations that are publicly accessible around my hometown, sydney. this advice isn't for large commercial teams or projects - those will usually need permits. but if you\u2019re shooting light for creative/portfolio development, this advice may be right up your alley.\n\n\ni have to be quite flexible with the location for my shoots. i select a location based on one or more of the following factors: shoot style, time of day &amp; geographical area.\n\n\n**shoot style**\n\nthe style of shoot can be your biggest factor when selecting a location. this can include shooting for swim, street, activewear, or simply knowing you have to shoot at a particular location by request. if you\u2019re lucky though, you have creative control to influence this in some way. for example, swimwear may look just as good at a garden, beach house or pool and doesn\u2019t require a beach in sight. the more creative you are with your locations, the more interesting and novel your shoots could be.\n\n\nrecognise the strengths of different location types and adjust your shoot to take advantage of them. keep a shortlist of locations that have worked for you so you\u2019re not starting from scratch for every shoot, which can be hard. i save my locations on google maps so i can review them when looking at the area i might look to shoot in. this is a godsend for me.\n\n\n**time of day**\n\nthis to me is the factor with the biggest impact on the look of your photos. when you don\u2019t have time to scout locations (and i don\u2019t), you can instead rely on a couple of great tools: google maps and [suncalc](http://suncalc.net/). suncalc overlays itself on google maps and shows you the arc of the sun throughout any day. it will give you a pretty good idea of where the sun will be, and based on the type of location you can use this to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for your aesthetic.\n\n\nfor example, shooting a late afternoon session on an east-facing beach will probably see you plunged into darkness well before sunset as the buildings cast a shadow over the whole beach. using suncalc can instead help you find locations that might be facing more towards the sun and therefore get you more time to shoot (i use vaucluse a lot for late afternoon shoots). personally my favourite times of day are during sunrise and sunset so that i can get more interesting natural light punching through the shot, but that's just my style. when it comes to shooting inland, streetview and community-submitted photos are also your friend because buildings and elevation can limit the type of light you\u2019ll have and viewing the street imagery will help you see what you\u2019re in for.\n\n\nthere\u2019s also a case to be made about shooting indoors - if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a place offered. i\u2019ve done a number of shoots in apartments and used the furnishings and decorations to modify the light and create some really great scenes. \n\n\nif i\u2019m shooting when the sun is high in the sky, i look for man-made structures that can give me more interesting backgrounds, but can also shield myself and the model from the sun - or even act as a reflector to provide more even light. fortunately the more limited you are the more creative you have to be. if you're struggling to find structures to help you, instead adjust poses to make use of the light. embrace the harsh lighting!

In 2017, the brand and intellectual property of the Polaroid corporation were acquired by the largest shareholder of the Impossible Project, which had originally started out by producing new instant films for Polaroid cameras and was renamed Polaroid Originals in September 2017. Thus, Polaroid's masterpiece, the instant camera, is still with us.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cqs2j1lycsi11.png\n\nThis is the camera that make instantaneous printouts to hold, clip and paste. This conveniently compact camera fits in your pocket and requires no messy inks or expensive toners. Users don't need to fiddle with a flash or focus the lens; just\u00a0look through the pop-up viewfinder and click and out pops an adorable 2\"x 3\"sticky-backed picture ready to share with friends and family. Zink Zero Ink technology also helps save you a ton of money while keeping your memories alive. The 10-megapixel sensor captures millions of colors and tons of detail, while unique picture modes offer a variety of tones and filters to suit your mood. You can even add a 32-GB microSD card to save shots for social media or additional printing. However, the photo quality is not as good as that of a decent phone camera.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n**Instax Square SQ6**\n\nThis is a square format as a new addition to the instax series of instant camera lineup, allows users to enjoy on-the-spot photo printing. It is equipped with various features: with auto exposure control, the camera detects the ambient brightness and adjusts to provide the optimum shutter speed and flash light intensity, even in low light conditions. Three color filters that fit over the flash in orange, purple and green are included to add a pop of color to the images. Additionally, the camera can be set to a selfie mode which automatically adjusts focus and brightness. There is also a self-shot mirror attached to the side of the lens allowing you to check the shooting range.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8xhlfjb0dsi11.png\n\nBesides, SQ6 offers three unique modes, you can press the Mode button on the back of the camera\u00a0which you can choose between: the double exposure mode allows two photos to be overlapped on a single film when the shutter button is pressed twice; the macro mode allows users to capture beautiful close-up images of subjects up to a minimum of 30cm and the landscape mode can be used to capture long-range impressive scenic photos.\n\n**LG PC389S**\n\nThe LG Pocket Photo PC389S Instant Camera comes with a built-in printer. It uses dye-sublimation printing technology to output vibrant, high-quality prints onto 2.5 x 3.7\" adhesive-backed paper in around 45 seconds. The PC389S shoots photos with pixel perfection as well.\u00a0Each image encapsulates five million pixels of crisp detail to give a clear image with a radiant and full color spectrum.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5qbrhhh1dsi11.png\n\nLG's Pocket Photo App, available for iOS and Android, allows for image corrections to be made in addition to adding custom filters, decorations, and frames to your final photos. Connect the phone to your camera via Bluetooth or USB, and you're ready to print out your favorite pictures.\n\n**\u270ePocket Photo Printer**\n\n**Fujifilm SP-2 Instax Share**\n\nIf you like the look of an old-school, tangible print but still want to keep shooting with your smartphone, the Fujifilm Instax Share SP-2 is the best instant printer available.\n\nAccording to Fujifilm, the new SP-2 is faster, quieter, has better image quality, and a greatly improved Wi-Fi connection over the SP-1. The SP-2 has also a completely new design, featuring a silver or gold body with a sleek white casing and an internal rechargeable battery.\u00a0\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/snevjpj2dsi11.png\n\nYou can easily connect your phone to the printer via Wi-Fi and share access to your library of images with the free Instax Share app, which you can then use to do some minor editing and add a filter or a custom border. Thanks to a new laser exposure system, the new SP-2 's high-resolution 320 dpi print will be ready in just 10 seconds. So not only does it print faster, the pictures are a lot better as well. As for image files, the printer supports JPEG and PNG formats.\n\n**HP Sprocket 100**\n\nThe HP Sprocket is tiny and has a tiny output as well: the paper tray holds just 10 sheets, and the machine can only produce wallet-size, 2 x 3\" photos. This is because it uses the zero-ink technology, which uses heat-activated paper instead of ink or dye sublimation. Zink doesn't produce the most detailed prints and some of the colors appeared washed out. However, the look of these filtered colors may appeal to you.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fzd59sq3dsi11.png\n\nFor a novelty printer, printing off social media photos has never been easier from your smartphone. Connect your social media accounts to the free-to-download HP Sprocket App and instantly turn those photos into colorful prints. You can customize your photos before you print with the HP Sprocket App to add fun text, borders, emojis, and more. Add a pop of personality for snapshots and stickers that are totally and uniquely you.\u00a0\n\nI liked the HP Sprocket's simplicity and fun design, even if it's tough to come up with practical reasons for having it around.\n\n**\u270eWireless Compact Photo Printer**\n\n**Canon SELPHY CP1300**\n\nWith SELPHY CP1300, Canon added another option to the battery-powered portable mini-printers market segment. With this lightweight, mobile and Wi-Fi-enabled printer, sharing memories in real-time can be quite easy.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5zl54q95dsi11.png\n\nThe Selphy CP1300 is a wireless printer: it comes with a larger 3.2\" tiltable LCD display, an improved user interface, improved image search with a date filter, the ability to print 2 x 6\" photo strips and a Party Shuffle mode that is designed to allow Wi-Fi connected users to connect multiple compatible mobile devices to the same printer and create a print layout made by combining images from everyone. The printer also offers the option to connect an external battery, making it that much more portable.\n\nIf you want to see more product reviews at [here](https://www.valueq.com/).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9awutk/capture_and_freeze_your_special_moment_instant/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "capture and freeze your special moment: instant cameras and photo printers for shutterbugs /!/  with the craze of smartphone photography and digital cameras, physical photos seem like relics of the past and instant camera obsolete in almost every way. yet not everything we leave behind is worth abandoning. there is just an undeniable charm and whimsy to pressing the shutter button and watching an image develop right before your very eyes. yes, film isn't just for old fogies and nostalgists. lots of people enjoy snapping shots with a modern-day instant camera, as the compact and lightweight gadget hook up easily to your camera and deliver results that almost match digital in their immediacy.\n\nfrom selfies to sunday brunch, there's always a reason to celebrate with these instant film cameras and printers.\n\n**\u270einstant camera**\n\n**polaroid snap instant digital camera**\n\npolaroid has filed for bankruptcy and sold off its name to a holding company, which also went bankrupt long ago. in 2017, the brand and intellectual property of the polaroid corporation were acquired by the largest shareholder of the impossible project, which had originally started out by producing new instant films for polaroid cameras and was renamed polaroid originals in september 2017. thus, polaroid's masterpiece, the instant camera, is still with us.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cqs2j1lycsi11.png\n\nthis is the camera that make instantaneous printouts to hold, clip and paste. this conveniently compact camera fits in your pocket and requires no messy inks or expensive toners. users don't need to fiddle with a flash or focus the lens;

It's not really that I need help, I just wouldn't mind a bit of advice from your goodselves. I quite like the researching part of finding something new. In this instance I've been looking to get into MF for a while. I initially was thinking of going down the Mamiya or Bronica route but my head was turned by a Yashica 124G a few weeks back and after reading up on TLRs I think they would be a better fit for me.\n\nAfter researching for a while, I've come up with the following shortlist:\n\n**Yashica Mat 124G**\n\nThe camera that turned my head towards a TLR option. From what I've read they are classified as a good into camera and are quite forgiving. There is one listed in a local adverts site for \u20ac320 at the moment. It has been CLA'd and takes a modern battery to work the light meter. Everything seems quite clean and I probably couldn't go wrong with it although the lens can be soft enough wide open. I also think the price is a bit rich at the moment.\n\n**Rolleicord Vb**\n\nThis made the list after researching TLRs further. I like the look of the camera (not that important I know) and I like that they are well made machines. I'd prefer if the winder was the same as that on the yashica (which is the way the more expensive Rolleiflex has it) and it doesn't have a light meter. It also has a weird enough procedure to fire the shutter. In fact, you have to roll the film, then arm the shutter and then fire it. So it's not as automated as the yashica. At the end of the day it's a Rollei so it would probably keep its value and the Xenar lens is apparently stellar. I know of someone selling one in mint condition. It's been CLA'd so it's ready to go. (listed for \u20ac400)\n\n**Minolta Autocord**\n\nFrom what I've read, the lens on the Autocord is on par if not better than the Rolleiflexes (depending on who you read). I quite like the L / LMX models with the light meter. Has a unique system for evaluating the exposure for example if the light meter reads 13 - the correct exposure and aperature is then a combination that adds up to the number 13; so 4 and 9 or 6 and 7.

(listed for \u20ac400)\n\n**minolta autocord**\n\nfrom what i've read, the lens on the autocord is on par if not better than the rolleiflexes (depending on who you read). i quite like the l / lmx models with the light meter. has a unique system for evaluating the exposure for example if the light meter reads 13 - the correct exposure and aperature is then a combination that adds up to the number 13; so 4 and 9 or 6 and 7. unfortunately there aren't any autocords listed for sale anywhere at the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nso that's roughly where i'm at. just wondering what others thing. is it worth holding out and waiting for an autocord to appear or is the rolleicord the best choice overall. or is the yashica the no-brainer\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthanks for yer help!\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gu4y0y)", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 55761, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "TheAmazingPapaya", "date": "2020-09-17 23:07:07", "content": "Figured you guys would have the answer if there is one.

Turns out there have been three separate recalls for this exact issue, but my serial number was not one of the ones recalled.

They told me that because my serial number wasn't affected, I would have to pay. \n\nI called their support team and asked for a manager to talk to see if I could get somewhere with them.

They would give me something along the lines of \"well this photo is shot with a Zeiss lens, so we can't do anything about it\". So I sent them an image taken with a Nikon lens that showed the same issue. They responded with \"the JPEG is doesn't have enough Metadata for us\" so I sent three .NEF files all shot with Nikon lenses showing the issue. They responded \"we don't see any issues\" so I sent crops that clearly show the issue to which they respond \"the image is too low quality\". They insisted that there hasn't been any service advisories for this despite they fact that their own website says it and there are countless articles online about it. Every time I sent something they made an excuse, and then when I countered that, they came up with a new excuse. \n\nSo I just authorized a payment of $316 for a camera that has a manufacturing defect that has been widely reported and repaired for free thousands of times.

I own a small agency that does web design, web development, and produces content for online stores. Currently I am the lead developer but it's not something I am super passionate about - I want to start offering photography and video services. I have always dreamed of being a professional filmmaker or photographer, and I am passionate about e-commerce, now that I am hiring other developers I feel like it's the right opportunity.\n\nI would like to offer the following:\n- Product photography\n- Product GIFs\n- 360 images\n- 3D product renderings for AR (when browser support picks up)\n\nGood product images &amp; interactive experiences increases conversion. I have a lot of pre-existing clients who would be interested. I'm not too worried about selling the service - but I'm not sure _how_ to sell it.\nHere are some questions I have:\n\n1. I am based in Canada. Most clients are based in US. Most clients have dozens (if not hundreds) of products. Shipping would be a nightmare - are these bad candidates to promote my services toward? Or is there some sort of solution that I am missing? I have zero local clients, so local would require building from the ground up.\n\n2. Pricing. No matter which way I run the numbers - it sounds like this service will cost a lot. Now, I am used to quoting large sums of money to build an e-commerce site, however that always seemed like \"boring\" and \"necessary\" work so the money made sense! Whereas I am passionate about photography and it seems \"fun\" and \"extra\"  - and because of that I'm having a hard time coming up with a price.\n\nHere's how I _think_ I would promote the service:\n\n1. Offer pre-existing clients a \"Free Package\". This package would be for one product, and would include: Cover photo (high-res, white background, and can rotate 360 degrees), 3-4 secondary photography shots (backdrops, props, editing, etc), and one GIF-style video.\n\n2. If the client likes the service, they can provide a collection (most online vendors have 'collections' of similar product types) and I could provide a quote based on the collection.\n\nNow the concern is, that \"Free Package\" would be valued at $500 minimum. Would take a couple hours to shoot images, edit, create 360, edit video, source backdrops &amp; props, etc. And I would need to include the price of shipping/returns, purchasing props, hiring model, etc.\n\nOf course, that Price Per Product could be reduced if I did an entire collection, since I could develop a workflow and could use similar props/models/edits. But still, $300-500 per product, that would mean $3,000-$5,000 per collection (~10 products).\n\nWould people be willing to pay that? Might be a harder sell than I considered?

It was an Olympus E-400, and I thought it was a bargain. I was drawn to this camera initially because of the letter E which I thought of as *Equality,* but you might think of *Excellent* and that would be a good guess. The 400 also piqued my interest because it is of course a square number, very prevalent in the photograph theory involving squares. But enough about me.\n\nThe guy who sold it to me was old and scary like a demon with a beard, and when he breathed in, it caused a vacuum in the air as if he had sucked up all of the Earth's atmosphere - the exact kind of guy you expect to meet at a local fair. He said he didn't want any of my money for the camera; he just asked me to take a photo for him some time and made me promise him. Seems easy enough. What's the catch, I thought? \n\nAnd then I forgot all about this demon man with vacuum breath of fire for eyes. I was really excited because photographs are sort of art in a way, and if you shake the camera a bit, the images can even look like a real painting.\n\nBut soon enough (immediately pretty much) I started to see things in the pictures I was taking. Then they became more obvious and more ominous. Ever since that fateful day, which had started much like any other, I have been cursed with haunted pics, no matter what I do most of the time. It's Hell. \n\nThe effects of the Poltergeist are varied. Lots of the pictures I take of people just look like ghostly apparitions - like normal people but floating about looking blurred, as if the ghost is manipulating reality towards the shadow realm, or maybe even the photons themselves are being warped by the presence of a spectre in the lens.\n\nSome photos are just blackness and at least 2 have just been pictures of the ground. That could be my fault though. One one trip, the Poltergeist even moved the CF card from the camera into my card reader and I didn't realise until I got home and I didn't have the photographs of any of the women I saw. That ghostly taunting message popping up on the screen made so much more sense now. \n\nThe next day, I put the CF card in, and it still came up with the same taunting message about the battery being low. I did the hack where you take the power block out and recharge it and it fixed it for a while but I have to do it pretty much all the time after any late night session with spiders in my house. But enough about me.\n\nThe final straw when I knew my ghost had taken things too far was when it photoshopped pictures of my amazing best friend and my girlfriend having sex. I can tell you, I certainly gave that ghost a piece of my mind for treating my best friend like an animal in that way and my girlfriend too. I remember my girlfriend sort of looked really sad at the time, in so many different ways. Probably because understood the pain I go through.\n\nBut enough about me, I don't want me to come across as arrogant or some sort of drama queen, but I came to find out based on multiple possibilities and my own experience that the mysterious camera guy was the Devil, and he had most likely given me a cursed camera for some sort of malevolent purpose, or maybe just a hellish prank?\n\nHe's not asked me to take that photo for him yet, but I'm not worried because I don't think he will. It is like when you give a kid a skateboard and you tell him to show you a trick some day and he never does.\n\nI have tried to get rid of the camera but I just can't. I've been to about ten different spots deep in the woods and tried to bury it so it's out of my life for good, but every single time I go back the next day to see if it's been taken and every single time it's in the exact same spot I left it. It's a curse!\n\nMy back has hurt a lot more lately. I don't know if it's related?\n\nAnyway, I Just wondered if anybody else had any experience with a haunted camera, video-recorder, or any haunted electronics really. My great uncle always swore that his 303 was haunted, but one night I heard those riffs bubbling out the attic at 4am and knew that no way on Earth could a haunted synth sound that good. He also died of a meth overdose so he talked a lot of shit. My last digital camera was haunted with many of the same symptoms, but by a different ghost /low-level demon.\n\nI think it is worth mentioning, I took a picture of a dead beetle once so the beetle's spirit might have inhabited my camera, but I since deleted the picture because I didn't want any backlash if it got leaked to the media. It's probably not related, but I hope by deleting the Image, I am deleting the Spirit.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/cfgjvm/anyone_else_have_a_haunted_camera/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "came up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "anyone else have a haunted camera?
