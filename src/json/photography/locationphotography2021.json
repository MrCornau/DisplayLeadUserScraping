Im dealing with the whole freeloading friends situation but with a twist. \n\nSo I usually do landscape or street photography but I originally wanted to portraits when I started out. I never got the opportunity until recently to do so because either I was too shy or people acted like they were too good to let me practice on them. I would literally get on my social media and ask people\u2026nobody ever responded. So I started doing my own thing cause Im not gonna let that stop me from getting practice in. I bought a flash and gels to play around with for self portraits, posted them on social media and two of my friends asked if I could take their photos with that set up. I agreed because Im going to need a portfolio.\n\nWe arrive at the location and I\u2019m taking warm up shots. One of my friends proceeds to tell me that I could make a career out of this as if that isnt what I originally wanted my work to revolve around. I just brush it off and proceed with shooting. My other friend had brought his camera too and is asking how I do such and such but clearly isn\u2019t listening when I show him how so Im pretty much taking photos on his camera because he doesn\u2019t want to learn ig.

I agree and tell them we can go this skyline spot so we can catch golden hr and sunset there. Both of them tell me that sunset starts at a certain time and I tell them we need to be there for golden hour if they want good light (this also isn\u2019t the first time Ive explained this to them but I\u2019ll get to that in a second) Of course they thought I was just trying to be a know it all because we arrived too late at the location and were losing light quickly\u2026and they had the nerve to complain. \n\nThat really irked me because this is the 3rd time they\u2019ve made me late to a location to get a shot. The first two times I had set alarms to get up for blue hour and I got up on time and they got up late begging me not to leave because they need to get ready\u2026when I wasn\u2019t even taking photos of them. \n\nNow this the part that really has me really rethinking things with these people. We decided to hang out but this time our other friend was in town so she joined us. I get in the car and they start talking bout how one of their bdays is coming up and how they got an airbnb and everything and they want me to come so I can take photos of them and their other friend who makes clothes\u2026they had planned and booked the whole entire trip and then asked me meaning I wasn\u2019t even originally part of the plan until they saw I could actually take great photos.\n\nI had brought my gear with me because I wanted to try out some light trails and astrophotography. Im setting my stuff up and she goes \u201coh you have like a real deal setup\u201d\u2026.yes\u2026yes i did u think I just spent thousands of dollars to be a poser Anyway\u2026brushed it off and kept it pushing. Im doing light trails and the same friend jumps in front of the camera and is asking me to take a picture and I\u2019m like okay but I\u2019m doing something and you\u2019re ruining my\nphotos\u2026.she simply doesnt care she tells me to just \u201cclick the button\u201d. I tell her thats not how it works but I can grab my flash and take a photo if she\u2019d like. So I do that and proceed with what I was originally doing. She then proceeds to get really close to the lens and is asking me to take photos like\u2026.that\u2019s not how this works dude. It was like everything I said was going in one ear and out the other.\n\nWhen she finally stops doing that, she joins the others two and I hear them discussing the birthday trip. They\u2019re talking about how they want all these photos at all these different locations and how we could be a glam squad. While they\u2019re discussing that, the same friend from earlier is stepping back into my frames\u2026.and its not she doesn\u2019t know but I let her know anyway.

I\u2019m in the creative field and do various things from branding, marketing, painting, video and obviously some photography. So my son has been around these kinds of creative outlets for a long time. For the past couple years he\u2019s been showing a deeper interest in photography.\n\nHe asked a few times to borrow my camera and went into the woods, creek and local park area to shoot some cool shots on his own without any guidance.

And for a lot of people it\u2019s fulfilling hobby that they just love to do. And yes technically you can go to school (college) to study photography, but that would most likely be part of studying other media subjects. So all of these experiences and anecdotal issues are running through my head while he\u2019s talking and I always encourage my sons to do whatever they are passionate about, But I didn\u2019t want to get hung up on the details of what it takes to be a professional photographer and squash his dreams or damper his excitement. Because if he truly loves to do it then I would encourage him to find ways to make it happen.\n\nSo this is when I had my epiphany moment, I looked at him and said, \u201cjust go shoot.\u201d If you love it just go shoot. Wherever you want to go I can drive you there and spend time at different local areas.

Maybe get low on the ground or climb an object to get a higher vanish point and shoot something in multiple angles. You can do all of this with your iPhone. Then I showed him the 10,000 photos I have on my iPhone. A lot of them are interesting things I have seen during my every day life and just wanted to take a snapshot of it figuring I might use it later on for something. \n\nIf you love the idea of capturing moments that are unique to your eye and your experience you don\u2019t need a $5,000 camera to do it. And you don\u2019t need to think too hard about it at this point in your life (talking to him)... being a pro, college, etc...\n\nI\u2019m not downplaying the value of great equipment because I know what that means but the point I wanted to share is he didn\u2019t need to get hung up on all of the challenges of what it takes to become a photographer.

I started learning on my sister's Canon Rebel T7, which has been kind of challenging since it's not the easiest to use when you are learning the basics.\n\nHowever, I still managed to learn a lot and become really interested in pursuing photography more seriously. I am interested in taking portraits, in fashion photography, as well as just taking really cool pictures in different locations.\n\nTherefore, I would like to purchase a camera of my own to take this next step. I need some advice though...\n\n**First, DSLR or Mirrorless?** \n\nI have watched countless videos explaining the differences and the pros and cons of each. However, I would like to have some feedback from you guys. I know it might be easier to get a budget DSLR than mirrorless, and I also am under the impression that DSLR cams have better quality but that might be a myth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Secondly, any specific recommendations?**\n\nI have been looking at used cameras, but I am open to any recommendations for both used and new.

ALOHA and welcome back to [another one of my tuts!](https://www.danieljstein.com/tutorials) It seems peeps are really digging this very specific [nightscape](https://danieljstein.com/nightscapes) and astrophotography content and that is just wonderful. Since Milky Way Core season is in full swing, today I am going to level up and discuss one of my favorite topics. **Star Trackers.**\n\n# So what in tarnation is a [Star Tracker?](https://i.imgur.com/aXWdAhv.jpg) Sounds like something they would use in Star Wars.\n\nFear not young citizen, you are not alone. The name certainly sounds foreign, but after this write-up I am hoping you can toss around the phrase at your next pammy time friendly family gathering\u2014idk maybe that might not be the strongest topic. Anywho, one thing I will mention is that these are very nich\u00e9 devices. This is the type of product I would recommend getting after dabbling in astro and nightscapes for a few nights and seeing if it is your thing. And if you do not know where to start, I gotchyu,[ check out my tut on how to find and shoot the Milky Way here.](https://danieljstein.com/tutorials/milkywaybasics) \n\n# If you have been out for a few nights under the stars and just want more and more and more astro shots, then this is the place to be. \n\nA star tracker is some sort of motorized device which when properly aligned can follow the Earth\u2019s sidereal rotation and thus compensate for the relative movement of the stars. **The rotation of the Earth is why we need to use the** [**NPF rule**](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/advanced-astrophotography-shutter-time-calculator/) **to shoot the stars, otherwise the stars will begin to trail if the shutter is dragged out too long.** This means that we can expose shots of the stars for much longer. Why is this a huge benefit and what does that have to do with buying a new lens? Keep reading to find out. This gets s h i f t y.\n\nYou may have started researching a new lens to pickup to improve your astro work. And this is precisely where I would say freeze. Record scratch. Lemme tell you a little secret\u2026. **your money is much better spent on a tracker than it is on new glass**. Now okay. Full disclosure. A tracker is not going to *entirely* replace the need for a new lens, but it will essentially bring new life to your current lenses. **You are still far better off buying a $250 tracker over even a $500 lens because how much capability these things have.** I will standby that statement to the max becauseeeeee\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\n# A tracker can make an eh lens great. No Lie. No Lie. No Lieeee\n\nYah you heard that right. No bamboozles. Why? How? What? Dan you can\u2019t just turn an 18-55 kit and pretend it is a 24-70 2.8. No. No. You are right about that, but listen in on a little secret here. \n\nIn astrophotography, many properties commonly discussed when using a lens in the day become irrelevant. For example autofocus speed, depth of field rendering, etc. But on the counter, some distortions not typically seen during the day make their way into astro shots. Such as[coma, astigmatism, and longitudinal chromatic aberration (loCA).](https://i.imgur.com/YIk1Nkp.jpg)\n\nSo then how does a tracker fix these distortions? Simple. Because the tracker is \u201cfollowing\u201d the stars, we can expose for longer. Say 2, 3, and even 4 minute shots, wow! **With that being possible there is much more light reaching the sensor and thus** ***not only can we bring down the ISO to reduce noise, but we can also stop down the lens!!!*** **When we stop down our lenses, we are mitigating some of these distortions.** This is true for any lens. Simple physics.\n\nLook a the difference in corner sharpness by stopping down a Nikon 20 1.8G f mount lens by just one stop. I would not recommend using this lens wide open for instance. [Before](https://i.imgur.com/PQ4eZby.jpg). | [After](https://i.imgur.com/r1yCRep.jpg).\n\n## A tracker will increase detail in your astro shots.\n\nI mean who doesn\u2019t want the juiciest astro shots out there? Well, a tracker can allow you to get that J U I C E. This again goes back to longer exposures. Longer exposures will allow you to not only stop down enhancing the sharpness of your glass as mentioned above, but you will be able to lower your ISO. With a lower ISO there will be much less noise in your shots. And again, the reason we can lower the ISO here is because you are getting more data in your shots. \n\n**Quick note:** ***Noise is not a product of ISO. Lack of signal is*****.** ISO is the \u201cvolume dial\u201d essentially at which you can adjust your sensor to in an effort to brighten your shots. It does not compensate for a lack of light. **Trackers however DO** because again, longer exposures. So with more signal, there is less noise, and thus far more detailed shots. Pretty wow right.\n\nCheck out this comparison between an [untracked](https://i.imgur.com/Tqt1w1l.jpg) and [tracked](https://i.imgur.com/Q1dhd0A.jpg) RAW file. The same camera and lens was used in this setup. Notice how also the stars are much sharper in the tracked shot? This is because I was able to stop down as a result of taking advantage of longer exposure.\n\n# The Caveat: Trackers require more work.\n\nWith every action there is an equal but opposite reaction (I guess that kind of works in this sense)? What I mean by this is a tracker not only requires more work to use and setup, but it is an additional item to keep in your bag, take on hikes, and travel with. **I personally think the added bulk is worth the results, and I hike with mine and will always bring it,** but it just needs to be said. \n\nAlso, and this is a biggie, you may be wondering what happens to the landscape when the tracker is rotating your camera. You guessed it, the landscape becomes a [blurry blob!](https://i.imgur.com/W7BJCkm.jpg) Something has got to become blurry in this equation, and that is just the way the cookie crumbles. To combat this blurriness then, [you will need to shoot an additional shot](https://i.imgur.com/yrDeh7N.jpg)(s) with the tracker off and use Photoshop or Gimp or other software to mask and [blend them together.](https://i.imgur.com/qf7O0Hu.jpg)\n\nHowever, I see this as kind of an upside as it allows your to take separate, long exposures of the foreground and thus have nightscape shot that isn\u2019t just a silhouette of the landscape. (See examples above).\n\nTrackers also require you to be in a location which has access to a clear view towards your celestial pole (Polaris for Northern Hemisphere, Southern Cross for Southern Hemisphere) to properly align them. This is called a ***Polar Alignment***. I rarely find this to be an issue however. But of course, your mileage may vary depending on where you are shooting so it needs to be said.\n\n### Choosing a Tracker???\n\nTrackers come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and price ranges.[ You can even make them yourself for like 20 bucks if you are handy.](https://www.google.com/search?bih=939&amp;biw=1680&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=barn%20door%20tracker&amp;sa=X&amp;source=lnms&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03KVeyn0zJtMe1Q89Cs6zU_WbCD-w%3A1619692328851&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiq75-PoKPwAhUYa80KHT-hDLoQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA) I have seen some of the cheapest models on the market listed for like $80 which are perfectly capable for handling something like a Canon EOS Rebel and Lens, all the way up to the full on mega big and expensive [equatorial mounts](https://www.google.com/search?bih=939&amp;biw=1680&amp;ei=44uKYI7bFO28kvQPxcCJ6As&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBggAEAUQHjIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDoFCAAQsQM6BAgAEEM6BwgAELEDEEM6BAgAEAM6CAgAELEDEIMBUMIVWJc4YNA5aABwAHgAgAFHiAG6CJIBAjE3mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;oq=eq6r%20pro&amp;q=eq6r%20pro&amp;sclient=img&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjO2JbooKPwAhVtnoQIHUVgAr0Q2-cCegQIABAA) which are meant for shooting deep space targets and planets with telescopes.\n\nI am not going to get into the specifics of which one you should buy in this post, but if you have already done some preliminary research on a model or two you are eyeing up, feel free to lemme know in the comments below and I can chime in with my recommendations based on your budget and what you want to shoot. Since we are talking about widefield nightscapes however, models to keep in mind are the Sky Watcher Star Adventurer (both [pro](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/collections/star-adventurer/products/star-adventurer-pro-pack) and [mini](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/collections/star-adventurer-mini/products/star-adventurer-mini-pro-pack)) [iOptron Skyguider Pro](https://www.ioptron.com/product-p/3550.htm) (what I use personally), [iOptron Skytracker Pro](https://www.ioptron.com/product-p/3322.htm), [Move Shoot Move](https://www.moveshootmove.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsqmEBhDiARIsANV8H3ZKnmRKc20BciKhiQbsvUI3z13lDkLS3kZr13gY1rTfYD5T5_O5Ks4aAtRsEALw_wcB) Tracker, [Omegon Lightrack Mini](https://www.omegon.eu/camera-mounts/omegon-mount-mini-track-lx2/p,55040), and the [Vixen Polarie.](https://www.vixenoptics.com/Vixen-Polarie-Star-Tracker-p/35505.htm)\n\n*Please note, I am not affiliated with any of the products mentioned above in any way. The links used are direct links to each respective manufacturer. I will be referencing the iOptron Skyguider Pro going forward in this tut because that is why I own, but again, no affiliation with iOptron (or the William Optics Base, Gitzo, Vello, and Really Right Stuff products for that matter).* \n\n*Another note: I highly recommend getting a tracker with an altitude-azimuth base or adding one in if the model you want does not come with one and you can afford it. This will make polar alignment a lot easier as they have latitude markings printed on the site and will always keep your tracker level so long as the tripod is level. If not, use what you have for now. It will still work.*\n\nTracker with [alt-az base setup.](https://i.imgur.com/CO3oUcg.jpg)| Tracker with [double ball head setup.](https://i.imgur.com/y6IlDGy.jpg)\n\n### Polar Alignment. Poggers. How?\n\nNah, this is the fun part! Now like I said earlier I am not going to focus on polar aligning your tracker specifically as all models differ in some small ways. Instead I am going to give you a basic overview as well as tips and tricks to get any tracker setup and nail a **Polar Alignment**, which some would argue is the most difficult part of the setup. Of course since I will be using my tracker as an example in the following steps it may seem I am talking about my model specifically, but I think if you use this guide as a basis for understanding how these things work you can apply this knowledge to **ANY** tracker.\n\nMy best advice is a few days prior to heading out is to familiarize yourself with the night sky using the free [Stellarium program](http://stellarium.org/). Toy around in there with the stars in the night sky and how you can understand where to look to find either Polaris or the Southern Cross.\n\n### So how on Earth do I use one of these doohickies?\n\nI highly recommend going through the steps during the day to get a feel for the controls of your tracker, as well as looking through your tracker\u2019s [polar scope](https://i.imgur.com/LhjaZMy.jpg) if yours has one while moving them knobs on your alt-az base or ball head to see how the tracker moves. Understanding this movement will make it a lot easier to align everything when it goes dark.\n\nIf your tracker has a polar scope instead of a laser, you will need to download a [Polar Scope app.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polar-scope-align/id970157965) This will make it a lot easier to get a bang on polar alignment. The app will also display your latitude for dialing it into you alt-az base.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **When you are out in starland, be sure to let your eyes adjust for 15 minutes, and follow the steps using red safe light to keep your eyes dark adapted.** \n2. Look up. *Embrace the stars*. They are beautiful and are a rare site these days because of[ Light Pollution.](https://danieljstein.com/blog/lightpollution)\n3. Find the pole star with the naked eye. Don\u2019t lose site of it. \n4. Grab your tripod, and open er up. If your tracker came with an alt-az alignment base, you will need to remove the head. If you are using an additional ball head on your tracker and keeping the head on your tripod to align, you don\u2019t need to do anything at this point.\n5. Next remove the head if required. [This will expose the 3/8\u201d-16 standard thread at the base](https://i.imgur.com/HlySNuL.jpg). Nine times out of ten it will be this size, but if yours has a 1/4\u201d-20 thread you can [grab a 1/4\u201d-20x3/8\u201d-16 bushing for cheapies.](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1434548-REG/camvate_c0979_convert_screw_adapter_1_4_20.html)\n6. Screw on the alt-az base your tracker came with, or if you are using an additional ball head to align your tracker, [attach your tracker to that head at this point](https://i.imgur.com/haGlPtP.jpg). Reference the linked pictures to illustrate the two ways to set these babies up.\n7. Next, and this a lil secret I love telling people to help out with a **Polar Alignment,** [use the compass on your phone to roughly place the direction your polar scope looks towards when mounted on the tracker vaguely towards the Pole.](https://i.imgur.com/c2nR2mt.jpg) Ok, that sounds like a mouth full, so here meowt. Your tracker either uses a polar scope or a laser to align with the pole. [Whichever direction your alignment tool looks towards, is the direction you want to have facing 0\u00ba.](https://i.imgur.com/FYj4PZl.jpg) It does not need to be spot on at 0\u00ba, there are adjustments to correct this on final alignment.\n8. At this point use the [spirit level on your alt-az base](https://i.imgur.com/eunKBfx.jpg) or tripod if it is has one and level the tripod. If you don\u2019t have a base or tripod that has a level, you can use your phone. Try to get this as close to perfect as possible.\n9. [Attach your tracker to the alt-az base or ball head.](https://i.imgur.com/MvusQzy.jpg)\n10. Fire up your polar scope app and [notice the number slapped next to the latitude reading.](https://i.imgur.com/AWAZhzR.jpg) Use the altitude knobs on your alt-az base to[dial this number in as the numbers on your base correspond to the latitude.](https://i.imgur.com/cEI5C2j.jpg) This is already a great start to quickly finding the pole as now half the work is pretty much done. \n11. [Turn your tracker on](https://i.imgur.com/kkcT0jt.jpg). If your tracker has a polar scope, at this point it should be illuminated with the tracker in the on position. \n12. [Look through the reticle of your polar scope.](https://i.imgur.com/YnSJ2vD.jpg) It may need to be [rotated to a certain position](https://i.imgur.com/b0MgwPa.jpg) for the red light to illuminate it. Note: some trackers have a detachable polar scope illuminator. At this point, you should attach it.\n13. If your tracker has a laser instead of a polar scope, attach it. \n14. Remember when you found the pole star in step 2? Now it is time to find it with your tracker.\n15. Look through your polar scope or laser and simultaneously use the knobs on your alt-az base or ball head to move the entire tracker to the pole star. Once you can see the pole in your scope or the laser is pointing directly at it, **congratulations, you won.**\n16. At this point, laser aligned trackers are pretty much good to go, but trackers with a polar scope are a little more precise and require a few extra steps.\n17. Refer back to your polar scope app and find where the pole star is located for your given time and place. Use your adjustments on the alt-az base or ball head to get it as close to that location as possible.\n18. Once complete, [attach your ball head](https://i.imgur.com/diHnHJ0.jpg) (or 2nd ball head) to your [tracker\u2019s bracket](https://i.imgur.com/8LDE0vR.jpg), then attach the [bracket to the tracker.](https://i.imgur.com/CO3oUcg.jpg)\n19. Attach your camera to the ball head on the tracker. From now on, all movement of the camera will need to take place using the ball head. **DO NOT MOVE THE TRACKER ITSELF.** This will mess up your alignment and you will have to start all over again and that is no fun.\n20. Pro tip, rotate your ball head so the [little notch faces directly up](https://i.imgur.com/gsxb7ez.jpg) so you can easily correct for the angle of the tracker due to your alignment.\n21. [Time to shoot!](https://i.imgur.com/gsxb7ez.jpg) Frame up some compositions, and use a [remote or bulb timer](https://i.imgur.com/ZwqoBnR.jpg) to take a few minute exposures. The better your polar alignment is, the longer the exposures can be!\n\nLike I said, this is more of a general overview of trackers and how to get started with any one.

(see examples above).\n\ntrackers also require you to be in a -----> location !!!  which has access to a clear view towards your celestial pole (polaris for northern hemisphere, southern cross for southern hemisphere) to properly align them. this is called a ***polar alignment***. i rarely find this to be an issue however. but of course, your mileage may vary depending on where you are shooting so it needs to be said.\n\n### choosing a tracker???\n\ntrackers come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and price ranges.[ you can even make them yourself for like 20 bucks if you are handy.](https://www.google.com/search?bih=939&amp;biw=1680&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=barn%20door%20tracker&amp;sa=x&amp;source=lnms&amp;sxsrf=alekk03kveyn0zjtme1q89cs6zu_wbcd-w%3a1619692328851&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahukewiq75-pokpwahuya80kht-hdloq_auoanoecaeqba) i have seen some of the cheapest models on the market listed for like $80 which are perfectly capable for handling something like a canon eos rebel and lens, all the way up to the full on mega big and expensive [equatorial mounts](https://www.google.com/search?bih=939&amp;biw=1680&amp;ei=44ukyi7bfo28kvqpxccj6as&amp;gs_lcp=cgnpbwcqaziccaaybggaeauqhjiecaaqgdiecaaqgdiecaaqgdiecaaqgdiecaaqgdiecaaqgdiecaaqgdiecaaqgdofcaaqsqm6bagaeem6bwgaeledeem6bagaeam6cagaeledeimbumivwjc4yna5aabwahgagafhiag6cjibaje3maeaoaebqgelz3dzlxdpei1pbwfaaqe&amp;oq=eq6r%20pro&amp;q=eq6r%20pro&amp;sclient=img&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahukewjo2jbookpwahvtnoqihuvgar0q2-ccegqiabaa) which are meant for shooting deep space targets and planets with telescopes.\n\ni am not going to get into the specifics of which one you should buy in this post, but if you have already done some preliminary research on a model or two you are eyeing up, feel free to lemme know in the comments below and i can chime in with my recommendations based on your budget and what you want to shoot. since we are talking about widefield nightscapes however, models to keep in mind are the sky watcher star adventurer (both [pro](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/collections/star-adventurer/products/star-adventurer-pro-pack) and [mini](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/collections/star-adventurer-mini/products/star-adventurer-mini-pro-pack)) [ioptron skyguider pro](https://www.ioptron.com/product-p/3550.htm) (what i use personally), [ioptron skytracker pro](https://www.ioptron.com/product-p/3322.htm), [move shoot move](https://www.moveshootmove.com/?gclid=cj0kcqjwsqmebhdiarisanv8h3zknmrkc20bcikhiqbsvui3z13ldkls3kzr13gy1rtfyd5t5_o5ks4aatrsealw_wcb) tracker, [omegon lightrack mini](https://www.omegon.eu/camera-mounts/omegon-mount-mini-track-lx2/p,55040), and the [vixen polarie.](https://www.vixenoptics.com/vixen-polarie-star-tracker-p/35505.htm)\n\n*please note, i am not affiliated with any of the products mentioned above in any way. the links used are direct links to each respective manufacturer. i will be referencing the ioptron skyguider pro going forward in this tut because that is why i own, but again, no affiliation with ioptron (or the william optics base, gitzo, vello, and really right stuff products for that matter).* \n\n*another note: i highly recommend getting a tracker with an altitude-azimuth base or adding one in if the model you want does not come with one and you can afford it. this will make polar alignment a lot easier as they have latitude markings printed on the site and will always keep your tracker level so long as the tripod is level. if not, use what you have for now. it will still work.*\n\ntracker with [alt-az base setup.](https://i.imgur.com/co3oucg.jpg)| tracker with [double ball head setup.](https://i.imgur.com/y6ildgy.jpg)\n\n### polar alignment. poggers. how?\n\nnah, this is the fun part! now like i said earlier i am not going to focus on polar aligning your tracker specifically as all models differ in some small ways. instead i am going to give you a basic overview as well as tips and tricks to get any tracker setup and nail a **polar alignment**, which some would argue is the most difficult part of the setup. of course since i will be using my tracker as an example in the following steps it may seem i am talking about my model specifically, but i think if you use this guide as a basis for understanding how these things work you can apply this knowledge to **any** tracker.\n\nmy best advice is a few days prior to heading out is to familiarize yourself with the night sky using the free [stellarium program](http://stellarium.org/). toy around in there with the stars in the night sky and how you can understand where to look to find either polaris or the southern cross.\n\n### so how on earth do i use one of these doohickies?\n\ni highly recommend going through the steps during the day to get a feel for the controls of your tracker, as well as looking through your tracker\u2019s [polar scope](https://i.imgur.com/lhjazmy.jpg) if yours has one while moving them knobs on your alt-az base or ball head to see how the tracker moves. understanding this movement will make it a lot easier to align everything when it goes dark.\n\nif your tracker has a polar scope instead of a laser, you will need to download a [polar scope app.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polar-scope-align/id970157965) this will make it a lot easier to get a bang on polar alignment. the app will also display your latitude for dialing it into you alt-az base.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n1. **when you are out in starland, be sure to let your eyes adjust for 15 minutes, and follow the steps using red safe light to keep your eyes dark adapted.** \n2. look up. *embrace the stars*. they are beautiful and are a rare site these days because of[ light pollution.](https://danieljstein.com/blog/lightpollution)\n3. find the pole star with the naked eye. don\u2019t lose site of it. \n4. grab your tripod, and open er up. if your tracker came with an alt-az alignment base, you will need to remove the head. if you are using an additional ball head on your tracker and keeping the head on your tripod to align, you don\u2019t need to do anything at this point.\n5. next remove the head if required. [this will expose the 3/8\u201d-16 standard thread at the base](https://i.imgur.com/hlysnul.jpg). nine times out of ten it will be this size, but if yours has a 1/4\u201d-20 thread you can [grab a 1/4\u201d-20x3/8\u201d-16 bushing for cheapies.](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1434548-reg/camvate_c0979_convert_screw_adapter_1_4_20.html)\n6. screw on the alt-az base your tracker came with, or if you are using an additional ball head to align your tracker, [attach your tracker to that head at this point](https://i.imgur.com/haglptp.jpg). reference the linked pictures to illustrate the two ways to set these babies up.\n7. next, and this a lil secret i love telling people to help out with a **polar alignment,** [use the compass on your phone to roughly place the direction your polar scope looks towards when mounted on the tracker vaguely towards the pole.](https://i.imgur.com/c2nr2mt.jpg) ok, that sounds like a mouth full, so here meowt. your tracker either uses a polar scope or a laser to align with the pole. [whichever direction your alignment tool looks towards, is the direction you want to have facing 0\u00ba.](https://i.imgur.com/fyj4pzl.jpg) it does not need to be spot on at 0\u00ba, there are adjustments to correct this on final alignment.\n8. at this point use the [spirit level on your alt-az base](https://i.imgur.com/eunkbfx.jpg) or tripod if it is has one and level the tripod. if you don\u2019t have a base or tripod that has a level, you can use your phone. try to get this as close to perfect as possible.\n9. [attach your tracker to the alt-az base or ball head.](https://i.imgur.com/mvusqzy.jpg)\n10. fire up your polar scope app and [notice the number slapped next to the latitude reading.](https://i.imgur.com/awazhzr.jpg) use the altitude knobs on your alt-az base to[dial this number in as the numbers on your base correspond to the latitude.](https://i.imgur.com/cei5c2j.jpg) this is already a great start to quickly finding the pole as now half the work is pretty much done. \n11. [turn your tracker on](https://i.imgur.com/kkct0jt.jpg). if your tracker has a polar scope, at this point it should be illuminated with the tracker in the on position. \n12. [look through the reticle of your polar scope.](https://i.imgur.com/ynsj2vd.jpg) it may need to be [rotated to a certain position](https://i.imgur.com/b0mgwpa.jpg) for the red light to illuminate it. note: some trackers have a detachable polar scope illuminator. at this point, you should attach it.\n13. if your tracker has a laser instead of a polar scope, attach it. \n14. remember when you found the pole star in step 2? now it is time to find it with your tracker.\n15. look through your polar scope or laser and simultaneously use the knobs on your alt-az base or ball head to move the entire tracker to the pole star. once you can see the pole in your scope or the laser is pointing directly at it, **congratulations, you won.**\n16. at this point, laser aligned trackers are pretty much good to go, but trackers with a polar scope are a little more precise and require a few extra steps.\n17. refer back to your polar scope app and find where the pole star is located for your given time and place. use your adjustments on the alt-az base or ball head to get it as close to that location as possible.\n18. once complete, [attach your ball head](https://i.imgur.com/dihnhj0.jpg) (or 2nd ball head) to your [tracker\u2019s bracket](https://i.imgur.com/8lde0vr.jpg), then attach the [bracket to the tracker.](https://i.imgur.com/co3oucg.jpg)\n19. attach your camera to the ball head on the tracker. from now on, all movement of the camera will need to take place using the ball head. **do not move the tracker itself.** this will mess up your alignment and you will have to start all over again and that is no fun.\n20. pro tip, rotate your ball head so the [little notch faces directly up](https://i.imgur.com/gsxb7ez.jpg) so you can easily correct for the angle of the tracker due to your alignment.\n21. [time to shoot!](https://i.imgur.com/gsxb7ez.jpg) frame up some compositions, and use a [remote or bulb timer](https://i.imgur.com/zwqobnr.jpg) to take a few minute exposures. the better your polar alignment is, the longer the exposures can be!\n\nlike i said, this is more of a general overview of trackers and how to get started with any one. so if you have any questions or comment below lemme know. as always, you can find my work on my [insta @danieljstein](https://www.instagram.com/danieljstein) and [website](https://www.danieljstein.com).", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 98683, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 96101, "autor": "adhoc_pirate", "date": 1619781670000, "content": "Ennui &amp; what to do with my photos? /!/ A little background to start off with...\n\nI'm a former professional photographer, mainly in the travel, landscape, editorial sector.

Have got a great relationship with them all, as well as with dozens of models, artists, clients, etc. What I'm trying to say is that I know them all and they all know me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast Saturday night I'm contacted by a \"modelling agency\" which at first glance seems legit with its 80k followers (only three posts though... hmm...), including a few folks I know well. They're frantically in search of a team to shoot an editorial the following Saturday (yesterday) featuring his \"cousin\", which would be published in a somewhat well-known online publication (hmm...). But the agency is completely unknown to me- I don't really care though; haven't had a paid gig in a while, and nothing nefarious is crossing my mind yet at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA weeks notice to assemble a solid team is quite the task, largely because the wardrobe stylist often needs quite a bit of time to get their entire pull, which sometimes consists of samples having to be flown in from abroad. But I have a pretty empty week and so give assembling a quality team my all, bending over backwards for the client, who is already unlike any other client I've previously dealt with (more on that in a moment). The dude was some days texting me as early as 4:30am bombarding me with requests, and from the onset had a slew of completely unrealistic expectations, which I repeatedly had to bring down to earth. Frankly, the guy gave off strong Wolf of Wall Street cokehead vibes... \"but fashunnnn\"- yeah, nah. Guy was super aggressive and just on another planet it seemed. I was able to get a great stylist on board, but after she chatted with him on the phone she bailed on the shoot (not cool, as it potentially left me out my pay)... but by some grace of god, I was able to get another just two days before the shoot, and she completely hit it out of the park, getting the most incredible pull on such incredibly short notice. Kudos to her. I would also have my favourite MUA/groomer on set, with whom I've worked and been friends with for about a decade now- we've done dozens of shoots together, several of which were fucked up in their own special (but usually funny) ways. Her rate was probably 4x what they hoped to spend on an MUA, but I was adamant I wanted her, and so I got her- I needed her there because of her amazing vibe/energy, plus she really knows how to calm/ground me when things go sideways... and this was a shoot I was sort of anticipating that to happen. That's also why I made sure to get my favourite assistant to come along, even if was a 100% natural light situation and I didn't really need any assistance- just nice to have people you know and trust around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was admittedly going into the shoot with an already negative mindset, chock-full of all sorts of preconceived notions about the client... but kind of rightfully so. Guy wasted hours of my time on the phone (still might bill this tbh) talking in circles about pretty much nothing, just regurgitating his own unrealistic expectations of the shoot. This was merely going to just be for a fairly small scale online publication... which is mighty strange, because the guy pumped about $6,000 into the shoot just between my fees, and those of the MUA, wardrobe, and my assistant- that's not including the expensive location he rented, and all the random associated expenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you know what? Despite my going into it with a negative mindset, the day started out pretty great. I was working with people I loved and trusted blindly for the past decade, the weather was amazing, the location wicked, and the guy, while \"out there\" (in a douchey spoiled cokehead fratboy way) was really not all that bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, there's a but... there always is, isn't there? This one's quite a big one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuddy started pounding back beer after beer (and who-knows-what-else), and subsequently getting more and more aggressive. Despite us having been explicitly been brought on to shoot this ONE editorial, he kept asserting that we're to get MULTIPLE editorials-worth of content out of this one shoot. The guy was completely out to lunch with his expectations, and frankly has zero idea re: how the fashion industry works, which was immediately evident to the stylist once he started demanding she pull only high end luxury brands SS22 collections... Gucci, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc. This just told us he's just a brand whore and doesn't really have a clue beyond those marques.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire time I'm shooting and doing my thing, he's half letting me do my thing, but also half interrupting and trying to guide the shots. Clients often do that type of thing, but this guy was on another level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe later into the day we got and the more beers he crush, the more the energy became very toxic and awkward, and some things pretty evident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours in, a second model showed up. It was going to be his first ever shoot- my client just \"scouted\" him the week prior. The kid showed up with his dad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon as the second kid showed up, my (by then pretty well wasted) client started eagerly requesting we \"get the boys in the water splashing around\". Wut? This wasn't in any way, shape, or form, conducive to the story, which consisted of mostly high-fashion luxury fall winter pieces. But the more beers buddy downed, the more and more he kept yelling for us to get in the water (the location backed onto its own private beach).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got through all of the looks the stylist had pulled, and since we had an hour to kill (we were surprisingly ahead of schedule... guess because we couldn't wait to get out of there!), decided to just give the guy what he wanted with the water shots, which he claimed he'd be submitting as a solo story. Throughout the day the client had picked up and left with his beer to go swimming a few times and was largely uninvolved in the shooting process (except those aforementioned little interjections/suggestions), but by the time we got the boys in the water and all wet, he was 100% involved. The one kid who came later in the day had clearly never been in front of a camera and was extremely stiff, but also highly uncomfortable, especially by the time we got in the water. The client at one point went up behind him and lifted his shirt and sort of brushed his hand against his abs, proclaiming \"look how great your body looks!\", all while the dad was watching in horror and clenching his fists. We were merely just humouring the client with his request at this point and very lazily banging out these photos, I didn't want to be there taking these images just as much as everyone else... and the client just kept asking for more and more, until the green model finally answered \"no\" when asked \"are you comfortable with doing that?\" by the client. And then the shoot pretty much ended there, with 30 min to go on the clock- just enough time to pack everything up and gtfo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the thing... some of that might sound inappropriate to you lot, but not necessarily crazy or hellish as I've alluded to it being in the title... but there's more... there're details I hadn't yet mentioned to you. For instance, the \"cousin\" of the client, who was the star of this shoot, kept telling us he really didn't want to stay at the cottage with his cousin another night, and really just wanted to go home. We all thought he was joking, but after he'd mentioned it to us several times, we started to believe him, and to think that maybe he was somehow being held there against his will by this person who everyone on my team was 100% convinced was NOT his cousin, as he'd claimed. The kid kept mentioning that his \"cousin\" (the client) just threw money at everything and had bought him pretty much whatever he wanted. He said the cousin/client was begging him not to leave the other night and was sort of possessive over him. Final icing on the cake is that somehow the kids phone ended up mixed in with my gear (which I didn't pack... my assistant did) and we only found out about 40 min into our drive back to the city (almost two hours away)... so we had to turn around and meet them to hand it off. My assistant thinks it was a sort of SOS attempt from the kid, or a way of saving some time from whatever was about to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe we've all watched too many crime movies and feel like detectives, but after the shoot my entire team got on a conference call (we had almost two hours of driving ahead of us) and literally each one of us thought the exact same thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy is using the guise of being a modelling agency president to lure in innocent boys. He is throwing money at these shoots in an attempt to buy legitimacy in order to further sell the illusion. He's had several other shoots booked and is throwing a lot of money at them. All to sell the lie. The people see photographers with well-established names and expansive portfolios featuring all sorts of big name clients/publications, major agency-represented artists (wardrobe, hair, makeup)... and it all helps to sell his sick and twisted lie. His IG page with almost 100k followers is all fake- fake followers. The whole thing stinks, and I feel filthy after yesterday, and complicit in something potentially really really bad. This is the dark underbelly of the fashion industry you often hear about, but hope you'll never come across. This is not some unsubstantiated hunch... if all of us felt it, there must be something to it- we have all been working professionals in the industry for over a decade (the mua/groomer for over two decades)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been paid in full already, but haven't yet delivered my edits. I'd like to at the very least put out a warning/heads up to all the agencies this week about this guy- I think my team who was on set will also do the same. Just a warning suggesting they look into him before doing any work with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy post is super long and probably incongruent- I'm dead tired now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just had to share because I still feel seriously shaken by the events of the day, many of which were down to vibes/feelings which I can't convey in words. You'd have to of been there to full understand- lots of intricacies. Also an anti-masker (obviously?).... I've probably forgotten certain other details, but this should all do the trick. Oh, he also apparently works high up at Toyota in North America... another super random fact/red flag... why would he also be starting a modelling agency?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow would you feel? What would you do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR got booked on a paid gig last minute and feel the client is using the guise of \"modelling agency president\" to lure young boys for potentially really bad things. He's super aggressive, has unrealistic expectations, doesn't really know how the industry works, and throws money at everything. Also kept drinking and got wasted on set- touched one of the male models in a pretty inappropriate way, kept asking the boys to get in their trunks and in the water to splash around (a shot which wasn't in any way conducive to the story we had shot).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/p579st/yesterday_i_had_by_far_the_absolute_worst_shoot/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "yesterday i had, by far, the absolute worst shoot of my decade-long career as a fashion photographer (long post). /!/ i still feel dirty and somehow complicit to something evil.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni've been a fashion and portrait photographer in my city (major north american city) for just over a decade now, having worked with all the major artist and modelling agencies since pretty much the beginning- on a first name basis with all the agents/bookers. have got a great relationship with them all, as well as with dozens of models, artists, clients, etc. what i'm trying to say is that i know them all and they all know me.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nlast saturday night i'm contacted by a \"modelling agency\" which at first glance seems legit with its 80k followers (only three posts though... hmm...), including a few folks i know well. they're frantically in search of a team to shoot an editorial the following saturday (yesterday) featuring his \"cousin\", which would be published in a somewhat well-known online publication (hmm...). but the agency is completely unknown to me- i don't really care though; haven't had a paid gig in a while, and nothing nefarious is crossing my mind yet at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\na weeks notice to assemble a solid team is quite the task, largely because the wardrobe stylist often needs quite a bit of time to get their entire pull, which sometimes consists of samples having to be flown in from abroad. but i have a pretty empty week and so give assembling a quality team my all, bending over backwards for the client, who is already unlike any other client i've previously dealt with (more on that in a moment). the dude was some days texting me as early as 4:30am bombarding me with requests, and from the onset had a slew of completely unrealistic expectations, which i repeatedly had to bring down to earth. frankly, the guy gave off strong wolf of wall street cokehead vibes... \"but fashunnnn\"- yeah, nah. guy was super aggressive and just on another planet it seemed. i was able to get a great stylist on board, but after she chatted with him on the phone she bailed on the shoot (not cool, as it potentially left me out my pay)... but by some grace of god, i was able to get another just two days before the shoot, and she completely hit it out of the park, getting the most incredible pull on such incredibly short notice. kudos to her. i would also have my favourite mua/groomer on set, with whom i've worked and been friends with for about a decade now- we've done dozens of shoots together, several of which were fucked up in their own special (but usually funny) ways. her rate was probably 4x what they hoped to spend on an mua, but i was adamant i wanted her, and so i got her- i needed her there because of her amazing vibe/energy, plus she really knows how to calm/ground me when things go sideways... and this was a shoot i was sort of anticipating that to happen. that's also why i made sure to get my favourite assistant to come along, even if was a 100% natural light situation and i didn't really need any assistance- just nice to have people you know and trust around.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni was admittedly going into the shoot with an already negative mindset, chock-full of all sorts of preconceived notions about the client... but kind of rightfully so. guy wasted hours of my time on the phone (still might bill this tbh) talking in circles about pretty much nothing, just regurgitating his own unrealistic expectations of the shoot. this was merely going to just be for a fairly small scale online publication... which is mighty strange, because the guy pumped about $6,000 into the shoot just between my fees, and those of the mua, wardrobe, and my assistant- that's not including the expensive -----> location !!!  he rented, and all the random associated expenses.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nbut you know what? despite my going into it with a negative mindset, the day started out pretty great. i was working with people i loved and trusted blindly for the past decade, the weather was amazing, the location wicked, and the guy, while \"out there\" (in a douchey spoiled cokehead fratboy way) was really not all that bad.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nbut.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nyes, there's a but... there always

Help! /!/ Hey everyone, \n\nI have a situation that would really appreciate some advice and guidance on.\nHere is the back story:\nAbout a month ago, our small business got in contact with a photographer about some product pictures for our upcoming launch. We had several meetings with this photographer prior to the shoot with regard to budget and agreed upon a package that included 20 photos. We then split said package into e-commerce style photos and also a photo shoot with models, locations and additional props. \nSaid photo shoot was planned over the course of approximately three weeks with one of our business members taking care of booking everything. The photographer agreed in advance on four locations and a shoot duration that included 5:30am pick up (the shoot started at 7:30am) and getting back into the city around 4-5 (shoot was scheduled to end around 1pm). \nIn hind sight, it was a lot to pack into one day, but the photographer didn\u2019t say anything during any of our meetings and was the one that set the timing schedule and so we did our best to provide her with what she needed to make it work. \nThe day of the shoot arrived and around mid-morning, we were already running late. I was trying to make her aware of the time to which she would respond that she wasn\u2019t done and still had some shots to take at X location before we moved on. I started to get nervous when the first location went over our anticipated time by 1.5 hours. This of course affected timing for the second location and when 12:30 rolled around I suggested maybe we skip the last portion and go for lunch at the scheduled time.\nOnce again she insisted she wanted to continue and still had some shots to take from the shoot list.\nWe had previously scouted the locations but she on the fly decided she wanted to go to the beach instead so our drivers drove everyone there rather than the agreed upon location. This continued until 3 and then we broke for lunch. \nAfter lunch, I suggested we drop the final two locations given the time but once again she insisted that she wanted to finish the agreed upon shots and so we continued on. We finished around 8 (the last location was shot between 6:30-8)\nLogistically this was difficult because in the meantime we had to drop people off that hadn\u2019t anticipated the shoot length either.\nSo yesterday, a day after the shoot she sent us an email saying that the shoot had gone way over time, that we had added an extra location (not true given all locations were agreed upon and we actually stopped a location) and that the weather and \u201cother factors\u201d had contributed to the longer length.

Then you should know your value chain /!/ Hello everyone!\n\nI am writing this because I see a lot of people asking the same questions over and over and thought it would be nice to give you all the tools to answer your own questions. Or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. Why should you listen to me? With the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; I am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. I am not claiming I am the smartest person in the world, but I do feel confident in what I am saying here.\n\nThe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. In fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions I have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nThe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. A value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nFor example: If I am running a lemonade stand, I buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. If that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know I am creating ($200-$100)/(1+3+1) = $20/hour. We also know how much value each step creates. If I wanted to hire a buddy to set up the stand, then we know that unless they are priced at below $20 its not worth it. If I want to make my little brother run the stand, then unless they are priced at below $60, its not worth it.\n\nWhy does this apply to photography? Because like any business making the \"lemonade\" is just one step in the process. You also need to do: business functions, like billing, marketing functions like advertising, process functions like editing, and other small things like transportation. People forget these, or under estimate them, and it will ruin your profit margin.\n\nLets look at some example of how you can apply this to your every day.\n\nExample 1: a friend is asking you to shoot their product/event/person/dog, how much should your friends and family discount be?\n\nMany people do not realize this, but there is actually a business case to give a friends and family discount. When you look at your value chain, look at all the steps you do not need to do because they are a friend. You don't need to advertise, because they came to you. You don't need to network because you were already friends. Your communication time is less because you can get some of the details worked out when you normally hang out with them. Lets say you normally charge $900 for a specific job, and you add up all of these savings and it is $300. If you are struggling to get clients, then you can offer them the job for $600, which saves them $300 and gets you profit you would not have gotten otherwise. If you are packed full time with clients, you can offer them the job for $750, saving them $150, and earning you $150 more than you would normally earn since you saved all these costs.\n\nIn either case having your value chain, and knowing what your needs are (more clients, more money, etc.) lets you make a financially sound decision when offering a discount. More importantly it is a win-win situation as both of you are better off had you not made the deal.\n\nExample 2: You hear about this new app that will help you get clients, should you join?\n\nSimilar to the lemonade stand example, except it is slightly reversed, instead of hiring someone and setting the financial boundaries, you are being hired and the boundaries are set for you. Once again your value chain can come to your rescue and help you decide. Now I am going to assume anyone considering this type of gig is new to the business, as they always are in my experience. What you first need to do is quickly think about any red flags from your value chain perspective. In previous jobs, how much time was spent getting the client vs shooting/editing? If networking is 70% of your time, then when you outsource that task you are outsourcing 70% of the profits.\n\nAs a new shooter you may think that 70% is an absurd number but a quick google search of how long pros spend actually shooting will validate it.\n\nhttps://www.thephoblographer.com/2015/07/30/how-professional-photographers-actually-spend-their-time/\n\nFrom this link you can see that most photographers spend ~15% of their time shooting an editing, with one spending as little as 6% of their time on it. So if the only thing you want to do is shoot/edit, then you will only see 15% of the profits. How does that app sound now? For most photographers (let alone new ones) you can expect a small restaurant to pay &lt;$400 for an average food shoot. This means if you work for an app on this gig, you can expect to get paid &lt;$60 for your work. Dividing that by the time to travel to the site, get set up, shoot the food, tear down, travel home, and edit for your hourly wage and you are probably netting &lt; $15/hour. Maybe that's worth it to you, maybe its not, but you at least have the information to make the decision yourself.\n\nSo how do you create a value chain?\n\nI know it might be tempting to steal the % off the link above, and while that is a good starting point it wont work. Your work is different and takes different efforts. Your clients are different and require more/less work. Your location is different and needs more/less time to get around. Most importantly you business model makes a huge difference, are you trying to sell prints? Are you trying to sell to individuals? Are you trying to get repeat customers? Make your own value chain.\n\nFor a small new photography business what you should probably do is\n\n1. List out every step you need to take for a profit. Include things like advertising, networking, doing your finances every month, harassing clients for payments.\n2. Record the time it will take at every step. If you don\u2019t know, ask some pros for advice, if everyone hates you, take your best estimate and adjust, but use this as a last resort.\n3. Come up with a reasonable hourly rate for each step. Think of it this way, dont ask what you want to be paid for each step, ask what you would be willing to pay per hour to have someone else do it. The reason is because this sets up your mind to think of these as the minimum costs, which is what you want.  \n4. Multiple your hours by hourly rate, and total up\n\nExample of a value chain:\n\nTask 1: recruiting clients. 20 hours per week. $10/hour. $200 total.  \nTask 2: shooting/editing. 3 jobs per week, 3 hours per job. $20/hour. $180 total.  \nTask 3: transportation. 3 jobs per week, 1 hour per job. $10/hour. $30 total.  \nTask 4: business operations (e.g. billing). 10 hours per week. $10/hour. $100 total.  \n\nWhat does this tell me?\n\n1. I will be expecting to work 42 hours a week\n2. I will be expecting to have $510 in \u201ccosts\u201d per week\n3. For 3 jobs I need them to pay at least $510/3 = $170 a job\n4. If I outsource client acquisition I lose $200/$510 = 40% of the potential profit\n5. If I find a client that does not require transportation (e.g. in my building) I can offer them a $30/$510 = 6% discount\n\n*Note that these are made up numbers with no real relation to the real world*\n\nKeep in mind that these are the breakeven points of everything. So I would not, for example, price a client at $170 because that would be \u201ccost plus pricing\u201d which is generally considered bad. Pricing is a whole different demon to tackle and would have to be its own post.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more from people much smarter than me, I would suggest starting with this HBS article. Do keep in mind, however, that Porter's more refined and detailed value chain analysis is meant for companies, with different departments. For 1-5 people working a super small business, its not really all that necessary to get that detailed, but it definitely wont hurt!\n\nhttps://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-value-chain-analysis", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/q2mqhp/want_to_earn_money_from_your_photography_then_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "want to earn money from your photography? then you should know your value chain /!/ hello everyone!\n\ni am writing this because i see a lot of people asking the same questions over and over and thought it would be nice to give you all the tools to answer your own questions. or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. why should you listen to me? with the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; i am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. i am not claiming i am the smartest person in the world, but i do feel confident in what i am saying here.\n\nthe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. in fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions i have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nthe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. a value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nfor example: if i am running a lemonade stand, i buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. if that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know i am creating ($200-$100)/(1+3+1) = $20/hour. we also know how much value each step creates. if i wanted to hire a buddy to set up the stand, then we know that unless they are priced at below $20 its not worth it. if i want to make my little brother run the stand, then unless they are priced at below $60, its not worth it.\n\nwhy does this apply to photography? because like any business making the \"lemonade\" is just one step in the process. you also need to do: business functions, like billing, marketing functions like advertising, process functions like editing, and other small things like transportation. people forget these, or under estimate them, and it will ruin your profit margin.\n\nlets look at some example of how you can apply this to your every day.\n\nexample 1: a friend is asking you to shoot their product/event/person/dog, how much should your friends and family discount be?\n\nmany people do not realize this, but there is actually a business case to give a friends and family discount. when you look at your value chain, look at all the steps you do not need to do because they are a friend. you don't need to advertise, because they came to you. you don't need to network because you were already friends. your communication time is less because you can get some of the details worked out when you normally hang out with them. lets say you normally charge $900 for a specific job, and you add up all of these savings and it is $300. if you are struggling to get clients, then you can offer them the job for $600, which saves them $300 and gets you profit you would not have gotten otherwise. if you are packed full time with clients, you can offer them the job for $750, saving them $150, and earning you $150 more than you would normally earn since you saved all these costs.\n\nin either case having your value chain, and knowing what your needs are (more clients, more money, etc.) lets you make a financially sound decision when offering a discount. more importantly it is a win-win situation as both of you are better off had you not made the deal.\n\nexample 2: you hear about this new app that will help you get clients, should you join?\n\nsimilar to the lemonade stand example, except it is slightly reversed, instead of hiring someone and setting the financial boundaries, you are being hired and the boundaries are set for you. once again your value chain can come to your rescue and help you decide. now i am going to assume anyone considering this type of gig is new to the business, as they always are in my experience. what you first need to do is quickly think about any red flags from your value chain perspective. in previous jobs, how much time was spent getting the client vs shooting/editing? if networking is 70% of your time, then when you outsource that task you are outsourcing 70% of the profits.\n\nas a new shooter you may think that 70% is an absurd number but a quick google search of how long pros spend actually shooting will validate it.\n\nhttps://www.thephoblographer.com/2015/07/30/how-professional-photographers-actually-spend-their-time/\n\nfrom this link you can see that most photographers spend ~15% of their time shooting an editing, with one spending as little as 6% of their time on it. so if the only thing you want to do is shoot/edit, then you will only see 15% of the profits. how does that app sound now? for most photographers (let alone new ones) you can expect a small restaurant to pay &lt;$400 for an average food shoot. this means if you work for an app on this gig, you can expect to get paid &lt;$60 for your work. dividing that by the time to travel to the site, get set up, shoot the food, tear down, travel home, and edit for your hourly wage and you are probably netting &lt; $15/hour. maybe that's worth it to you, maybe its not, but you at least have the information to make the decision yourself.\n\nso how do you create a value chain?\n\ni know it might be tempting to steal the % off the link above, and while that is a good starting point it wont work. your work is different and takes different efforts. your clients are different and require more/less work. your -----> location !!!  is different and needs more/less time to get around. most importantly you business model makes a huge difference, are you trying to sell prints?

Recently I've been in touch with some friends who have opened a restaurant and I offered to come by and help them with photographs of the space and menus. I made sure that I was up front about my skill level. I spent many years working in restaurants so I know my way around them and always thought it would be cool to offer some marketing help as a side gig. This seemed like a good opportunity to learn and get experience with relatively low stakes.\n\nFor the shoot I arrived in early afternoon just as the restaurant was opening and shot till 9pm or so. I had my Sony A7iii, 90mm f2.8 macro, a 24mm f1.4, and a Speedlight with diffuser along with some modifiers.\n\n1.) Communication. These guys are my friends and they're very busy at the moment with the chaos of opening a new place, so communication with them about the date and time of my arrival was sporadic. In short, if I did this for paying clients I would insist on as much detail as possible. Where will I be shooting? How long will I have? How many dishes/cocktails will I shoot? Can I be near natural light (window) and still out of the way? \n\nBecause these details hadn't been worked out in advance, I worried needlessly over how much equipment to bring, how to organize my shoot, and what my shot list should be.\n\n2.) Timing when shooting a restaurant is really key. Time of day is important. You may want people in the restaurant so as to get some pictures of the place looking busy, but if it's too busy then the kitchen won't have time to make you dishes. If happy hour is popping off, the bartender isn't going to have time to make you cocktails. If you allow the chef to bombard you with dishes, garnishes may wilt, sauces will separate, and things will dry out before you're ready for them.\n\nSome things I'd do differently with future clients:\n\nPreparation: Visit the site prior to a shoot to take test shots of the space and identify good locations for setting up and shooting. Identify a shot list of things I want to catch during service. Where can I stand to get pictures of the line and be out of the way? Where will I be when the bar is packed during happy hour? Where are some sources of natural light? Is there space for me to set up a controlled scene for the plates?\n\nCommunication: Be direct and up front about physical and schedule needs. Manage expectations. Armed with some knowledge from the preliminary visit, convey where I'd like to be, what time I'll be arriving, when I'd like dishes to start coming, how many dishes they expect me to shoot, estimate how much time it will take to photograph each one.  \n\nTiming: Despite being on site from 4:00 to 9:00, I still felt like I hadn't given myself enough time, and I wish that I had divided the trip into two visits: one for space, crowd, and kitchen shots and then another for dishes and cocktails. Trying to do it all in one night was too much for me at this level of my journey. \n\nMostly I'm typing this out for me to remember what to do better. Lots of restaurants are opening back up and I think they're a very underserved and under-capitalized market.

Help... /!/ I'm hoping for some of your advice on how you handle photos of your nearest and dearest, especially special requests.  For background, my husband is an amateur photographer who mostly shoots fetish, lingerie, and art nudes with local models.  I encourage his interest, but have never modeled for him.  I recently mentioned to my husband I was thinking about hiring a photographer for a maternity shoot.  He offered to take photos instead if I sent him a Pinterest board of what I wanted, which I did. I bought the stereotypical lace robe, etc, and we took photos in a meadow.  The session was actually fun, and I think the photos came out great!!  \n\nThe problem is that my husband wants to edit each of the images before giving them to me.  I agree they could use a little tuning to make the colors pop, but he is producing images which are each drastically different from each other, and, in my opinion, heavily stylized.  In my non-professional opinion, they look like a heavy Instagram filter has been applied. One will be B&amp;W, one is sepia, one is faded like an old Polaroid with a vignette effect, one is 'sunset' colored, one looks goth, etc.  Not one retains the natural-white-robe-in-a-meadow look from the originals.  \n\nI asked if he could make versions which were lightly edited just for levels, saturation, etc and he refused. He said every photo has a version of itself which is objectively \"the best\" as a piece of art and I'm asking him to make the photos worse.  He said his versions are not heavily edited and asked me to explain what I didn't like, which turned into an argument where he justified that his decisions with every photo were right.  He finally said he would only give me the raw photos to edit myself -- and only IF I completely denied his involvement and never identified him as the photographer in any way.\n\nFirst, I'm worried this is a communication problem. I'm afraid I'm insulting him by not using the right words by saying \"stylized\", filtered, or heavily edited.  What I'm looking for are results like the last time I shot with a professional portrait photographer. They all looked consistent with each other and the editing wasn't apparent to the casual eye.  They just looked \"natural, but better\". Is there a better name for this style?\n\nSecond, do you think I'm overstepping by asking the photos to be edited in a certain way?  Would you feel that your artistic integrity was violated if a family member requested something you wouldn't do normally?  \n\nI'm so upset and surprised by his reaction, I'm considering hiring someone else after all, because I know they'll make the images as requested.

I think it\u2019s a trap that a lot of people fall into and some may not even realize it. \n\nI love being outdoors, hiking etc. so when l discovered photography, it only made sense to combine the two and take landscapes, and for a while it was awesome. Trips to me locations, shots I love, and friends and family always enjoy the photos. But as I took it more serious, I started looking at everything as a photo composition, which came with positives and negatives. This scene wasn\u2019t good enough, wrong time of year to visit, get upset when the sunrise doesn\u2019t produce etc. Soon enough I wasn\u2019t in nature, I was in a scene composing a frame, and nothing else. \n\nIt really kicked me recently in Iceland, where the first few days I didn\u2019t really enjoy it much, regardless of how good the shot was.

I was first drawn to the website in late 2018, by the r/photocritique Subreddit, and it remained a favourite of mine for a few years. While I loved giving feedback from time to time on other photography sites, I found myself spending more time on Reddit, as I felt the users there were actively seeking critiques. On top of that I find a lot of the work suffers from some of the same problems mine did, not too long ago. One word that tends to pop up a lot in my feedback is \u201cintent\u201d. There are a lot of rules in photography, all of which can either be followed or broken to various degrees. However, to me the difference between an image that \u201cworks\u201d and one that \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d, is how clear the intent behind each decision is conveyed.  For me, any location, any subject, and any style can work, so long as the image has been executed with a clear intent. Now, I know, I\u2019ve said the word \u201cintent\u201d about 300 times without explaining what I mean, so I\u2019ll break it down into two categories starting with:\n\n1) Shooting with intent - For me, this is one of the most important differences between an experienced photographer and an inexperienced one. If you talk to experienced shooters, I\u2019m almost certain a large number of them will tell you they rarely press the shutter without a general idea of what the end product is going to look like. When I\u2019m shooting, I more or less have the same mentality. For example, if I\u2019m shooting an image with a black and white conversion in mind, I\u2019ll consider the contrast within the scene, and try to use it in the most effective way.  Rather than shooting an image and just converting it later, I visualize the scene in black and white as I\u2019m shooting it. However these don\u2019t always work out as intended and I\u2019m never married to my original vision til death do us part. Sometimes they turn out completely different, because of an adjustment I made in post that suddenly helps me see the scene in a different way. This most often happens with my city abstracts. However, the majority of the time, even my abstract images turn out the way I originally envisioned.  So, why is shooting with intent so important? Well a few reasons, which means it\u2019s time for a list within a list.\n\n* It helps you frame the image appropriately. One of the biggest mistakes I used to make was not considering the crop I was going to use. This meant that I would often shoot the image with no breathing room. Now, I always shoot a little bit wider than I need, which gives me more freedom to make any minor changes I might come across along the creative process. This also comes in handy, when adjusting the lines and leveling the image. Often, if you shoot too tight adjusting the angles/lines or leveling the image can result in a loss of some elements, or it can throw off the composition/framing. Shooting wider ensures you can make these adjustments and still end up with the image you envisioned.\n* It helps you use the elements with in your frame appropriately. One of the biggest mistakes I see from new photographers is an image that has elements that don\u2019t seem to have any kind of cohesion within the frame. It\u2019s not uncommon for me to pop onto Reddit and quickly stumble upon a single image that looks like 3 separate images jumbled together, as the elements within the frame have no connection to one another. Taking a moment to really visualize the scene as a finished image can help you break it down into its components and realize what is or is not adding to the image, as a whole.\n* It helps you clean up the frame. Another common mistake I see is not putting yourself in the right position to get a clean frame. Other than \u201cintent\u201d, the other most commonly used pieces of advice I give is \u201cif you had taken one step to the left/right\u2026\u201d Scenes can be overwhelming, but it\u2019s important to avoid needless distractions which could have been easily removed by taking a single step in any direction.  The easiest way to avoid this is to take a picture, and check it in detail. This means checking the details within the image, such as the edges of the frame.  On the other hand, if you intend to clone something out in Photoshop, you can shoot the image with that element already erased in your mind. Sometimes it\u2019s impossible to get an angle that\u2019s high enough to cut out some branches or poles popping into the frame, so understanding you can remove them in post, is an advantage of visualizing the scene as a finished product.\n* It helps you consider the light. Another big problem I see people struggling with is lighting. So often I see an interesting scene, but it lacks the necessary light to make it pop. Or the light is there, but the photographer didn\u2019t consider the contrast, which results in blown highlights. Understanding what you want your image to look like will help you consider things like exposure blending and even focus stacking. Also, if you are going for a specific look, you may want to overexpose specific parts of he image, so knowing that intent before you shoot can prevent you from having to do extra work in post, which leads me to the final point.\n* It helps you with the editing process. I often hear people saying things like \u201csave it in post\u201d, but if you shoot with a clear intent, you don\u2019t have to go around saving images in post, rather you can spend more time enhancing them in post. I think I can count on one hand the number of photos in my portfolio that were \u201csaved in post\u201d, same goes for pictures I\u2019ve sold as art prints\u2026 wait, can you count to zero on one hand, or is that no hands? \n\n2) Editing with intent - the second part of photography, which I already mentioned above, is post processing. Without a doubt the biggest issue I see with people learning to edit is a lack of intent behind their choices. There\u2019s no bigger offender of this than what I consider to be my least liked editing choice, the teal sky. I don\u2019t know who started this trend, but I don\u2019t think we can be friends (I\u2019m sure they\u2019re losing sleep over that one). That\u2019s not to say I hate all images with teal skies, but much like a \u201cDutch Angle\u201d, there\u2019s a time and place for everything. More times than I can count in a day, I see an image on Instagram or Reddit, where the person has taken a picture of a scene, and just moved the blue hue slider to the left, with no intent. To be clear, in my opinion, \u201cI think it looks cool\u201d isn\u2019t what I would consider a good intent. I\u2019m not going to be hyperbolic and say \u201cthis is the death of good editing\u201d, but it does often ruin an image for me, regardless of the other elements. However, the dreaded teal sky isn\u2019t the only offender (looking at you \u201cCyberpunk Tokyo\u201d). While that one could be considered more of a trend-chasing edit, sometimes longstanding editing choices fall victim to this same issue. I often see images converted to black and white, for no other reason than it\u2019s what other people do or to make it \u201clook artistic\u201d. When it comes to editing an image for black and white, it usually helps if the picture was originally shot with that kind of edit in mind. When I shoot in black and white, I pay extra attention to things like contrast, and in some cases I intentionally overexpose some areas of the image.  So, what do I mean by editing with intent, and how can it help?\n\n* It helps you express or emphasize a feeling/atmosphere within your image. I just finished talking about how I dislike teal skies, but the full truth is that I dislike teal skies that are needlessly added to landscape or cityscape images. If they\u2019re used to enhance an image, for example a dystopian theme or a surreal image, then I actually like them. However, slapping a teal sky on your image of some mountains and a lake, doesn\u2019t make it surreal, it makes it some mountains and lake with a teal sky. I often use my editing software to enhance the color the scene provided to me, since RAW images tend to lose a bit of the natural color. This means, for example, I make editing choices to enhance the elements that come with a sunset, such as adding a touch of orange/yellow to help the viewer feel the warmth of the setting sun. That\u2019s not to say all of your edits have to look realistic, go as wild as you like, but be sure that each choice leads towards the image you intend to make.\n* It can help you guide the viewer to where they need to be looking. I typically do this by using local adjustments to make points of interest brighter, or to add depth to an image. If you have an idea of where you want to the viewer to be looking, then you can use your tools to assist them. All too often, I see an image and my first thought is \u201cwhat am I supposed to be looking at?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the focus?\u201d While a lot of this has to do with shooting with intent, a well shot image can be enhanced when accompanied by a good edit.\n* It enhances the image. I know this one is about as simple as they come, but when you edit an image with a clear intent, it\u2019s the easiest way to bring a RAW image to its full potential. I\u2019ll add a list of questions to ask yourself below, to help with this, but the basic question you want to ask is \u201cwhy am I making this edit?\u201d\n\nPerhaps, at some point, I\u2019ll write a post about how you know when your photo has \u201cfailed\u201d, as I feel it goes hand in hand with bad editing and not shooting with a clear intent. To wrap everything up nicely, there\u2019s no guarantee that every image you envision, shoot, and edit will turn out exactly as you imagined it, or even all that good, but if you do everything with a clear intent, the chances are much greater. To help achieve this I recommend asking yourself a few questions, when shooting and editing in no particular order:\n\n**When shooting:**\n\nWhat is the focus of this image?\n\nWhy am I shooting this image?\n\nWhat settings work best for this scene?\n\nHow do the elements within my frame enhance the focus or scene?\n\nAre there any distractions?\n\nWhat crop am I going with for this shot?\n\nDoes this location benefit from vertical or horizontal shot?\n\n**When editing:**\n\nWhy am I making these editing choices? \n\nHow do these edits enhance the image?\n\nHow can I guide the viewer\u2019s eyes with local edits?\n\nOf course, there a lot more questions you could ask, but start with these, and you\u2019ll start to think more critically about how, and what, you shoot. Just remember that shooting with intent and editing intent go together to enhance each other, much like pineapple on a pepperoni pizza - and that is a hill I\u2019m willing to die on.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/q20182/on_the_importance_of_intent_in_photography/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "on the importance of \"intent\" in photography. /!/ greetings reader,\n\nas you may, or more likely may not, know that i like to spend quite a bit of my downtime at work on reddit. i was first drawn to the website in late 2018, by the r/photocritique subreddit, and it remained a favourite of mine for a few years. while i loved giving feedback from time to time on other photography sites, i found myself spending more time on reddit, as i felt the users there were actively seeking critiques. on top of that i find a lot of the work suffers from some of the same problems mine did, not too long ago. one word that tends to pop up a lot in my feedback is \u201cintent\u201d. there are a lot of rules in photography, all of which can either be followed or broken to various degrees. however, to me the difference between an image that \u201cworks\u201d and one that \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d, is how clear the intent behind each decision is conveyed.  for me, any -----> location !!! , any subject, and any style can work, so long as the image has been executed with a clear intent. now, i know, i\u2019ve said the word \u201cintent\u201d about 300 times without explaining what i mean, so i\u2019ll break it down into two categories starting with:\n\n1) shooting with intent - for me, this is one of the most important differences between an experienced photographer and an inexperienced one. if you talk to experienced shooters, i\u2019m almost certain a large number of them will tell you they rarely press the shutter without a general idea of what the end product is going to look like. when i\u2019m shooting, i more or less have the same mentality. for example, if i\u2019m shooting an image with a black and white conversion in mind, i\u2019ll consider the contrast within the scene, and try to use it in the most effective way.  rather than shooting an image and just converting it later, i visualize the scene in black and white as i\u2019m shooting it. however these don\u2019t always work out as intended and i\u2019m never married to my original vision til death do us part. sometimes they turn out completely different, because of an adjustment i made in post that suddenly helps me see the scene in a different way. this most often happens with my city abstracts. however, the majority of the time, even my abstract images turn out the way i originally envisioned.  so, why is shooting with intent so important? well a few reasons, which means it\u2019s time for a list within a list.\n\n* it helps you frame the image appropriately. one of the biggest mistakes i used to make was not considering the crop i was going to use. this meant that i would often shoot the image with no breathing room. now, i always shoot a little bit wider than i need, which gives me more freedom to make any minor changes i might come across along the creative process. this also comes in handy, when adjusting the lines and leveling the image. often, if you shoot too tight adjusting the angles/lines or leveling the image can result in a loss of some elements, or it can throw off the composition/framing. shooting wider ensures you can make these adjustments and still end up with the image you envisioned.\n* it helps you use the elements with in your frame appropriately. one of the biggest mistakes i see from new photographers is an image that has elements that don\u2019t seem to have any kind of cohesion within the frame. it\u2019s not uncommon for me to pop onto reddit and quickly stumble upon a single image that looks like 3 separate images jumbled together, as the elements within the frame have no connection to one another. taking a moment to really visualize the scene as a finished image can help you break it down into its components and realize what is or is not adding to the image, as a whole.\n* it helps you clean up the frame. another common mistake i see is not putting yourself in the right position to get a clean frame. other than \u201cintent\u201d, the other most commonly used pieces of advice i give is \u201cif you had taken one step to the left/right\u2026\u201d scenes can be overwhelming, but it\u2019s important to avoid needless distractions which could have been easily removed by taking a single step in any direction.  the easiest way to avoid this is to take a picture, and check it in detail. this means checking the details within the image, such as the edges of the frame.  on the other hand, if you intend to clone something out in photoshop, you can shoot the image with that element already erased in your mind. sometimes it\u2019s impossible to get an angle that\u2019s high enough to cut out some branches or poles popping into the frame, so understanding you can remove them in post, is an advantage of visualizing the scene as a finished product.\n* it helps you consider the light. another big problem i see people struggling with is lighting. so often i see an interesting scene, but it lacks the necessary light to make it pop. or the light is there, but the photographer didn\u2019t consider the contrast, which results in blown highlights. understanding what you want your image to look like will help you consider things like exposure blending and even focus stacking. also, if you are going for a specific look, you may want to overexpose specific parts of he image, so knowing that intent before you shoot can prevent you from having to do extra work in post, which leads me to the final point.\n* it helps you with the editing process. i often hear people saying things like \u201csave it in post\u201d, but if you shoot with a clear intent, you don\u2019t have to go around saving images in post, rather you can spend more time enhancing them in post. i think i can count on one hand the number of photos in my portfolio that were \u201csaved in post\u201d, same goes for pictures i\u2019ve sold as art prints\u2026 wait, can you count to zero on one hand, or is that no hands? \n\n2) editing with intent - the second part of photography, which i already mentioned above, is post processing. without a doubt the biggest issue i see with people learning to edit is a lack of intent behind their choices. there\u2019s no bigger offender of this than what i consider to be my least liked editing choice, the teal sky. i don\u2019t know who started this trend, but i don\u2019t think we can be friends (i\u2019m sure they\u2019re losing sleep over that one). that\u2019s not to say i hate all images with teal skies, but much like a \u201cdutch angle\u201d, there\u2019s a time and place for everything. more times than i can count in a day, i see an image on instagram or reddit, where the person has taken a picture of a scene, and just moved the blue hue slider to the left, with no intent. to be clear, in my opinion, \u201ci think it looks cool\u201d isn\u2019t what i would consider a good intent. i\u2019m not going to be hyperbolic and say \u201cthis is the death of good editing\u201d, but it does often ruin an image for me, regardless of the other elements. however, the dreaded teal sky isn\u2019t the only offender (looking at you \u201ccyberpunk tokyo\u201d). while that one could be considered more of a trend-chasing edit, sometimes longstanding editing choices fall victim to this same issue. i often see images converted to black and white, for no other reason than it\u2019s what other people do or to make it \u201clook artistic\u201d. when it comes to editing an image for black and white, it usually helps if the picture was originally shot with that kind of edit in mind. when i shoot in black and white, i pay extra attention to things like contrast, and in some cases i intentionally overexpose some areas of the image.  so, what do i mean by editing with intent, and how can it help?\n\n* it helps you express or emphasize a feeling/atmosphere within your image. i just finished talking about how i dislike teal skies, but the full truth is that i dislike teal skies that are needlessly added to landscape or cityscape images. if they\u2019re used to enhance an image, for example a dystopian theme or a surreal image, then i actually like them. however, slapping a teal sky on your image of some mountains and a lake, doesn\u2019t make it surreal, it makes it some mountains and lake with a teal sky. i often use my editing software to enhance the color the scene provided to me, since raw images tend to lose a bit of the natural color. this means, for example, i make editing choices to enhance the elements that come with a sunset, such as adding a touch of orange/yellow to help the viewer feel the warmth of the setting sun. that\u2019s not to say all of your edits have to look realistic, go as wild as you like, but be sure that each choice leads towards the image you intend to make.\n* it can help you guide the viewer to where they need to be looking. i typically do this by using local adjustments to make points of interest brighter, or to add depth to an image. if you have an idea of where you want to the viewer to be looking, then you can use your tools to assist them. all too often, i see an image and my first thought is \u201cwhat am i supposed to be looking at?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the focus?\u201d while a lot of this has to do with shooting with intent, a well shot image can be enhanced when accompanied by a good edit.\n* it enhances the image. i know this one is about as simple as they come, but when you edit an image with a clear intent, it\u2019s the easiest way to bring a raw image to its full potential. i\u2019ll add a list of questions to ask yourself below, to help with this, but the basic question you want to ask is \u201cwhy am i making this edit?\u201d\n\nperhaps, at some point, i\u2019ll write a post about how you know when your photo has \u201cfailed\u201d, as i feel it goes hand in hand with bad editing and not shooting with a clear intent. to wrap everything up nicely, there\u2019s no guarantee that every image you envision, shoot, and edit will turn out exactly as you imagined it, or even all that good, but if you do everything with a clear intent, the chances are much greater. to help achieve this i recommend asking yourself a few questions, when shooting and editing in no particular order:\n\n**when shooting:**\n\nwhat is the focus of this image?\n\nwhy am i shooting this image?\n\nwhat settings work best for this scene?\n\nhow do the elements within my frame enhance the focus or scene?\n\nare there any distractions?\n\nwhat crop am i going with for this shot?\n\ndoes this location benefit from vertical or horizontal shot?\n\n**when editing:**\n\nwhy am i making these editing choices?

Long-time lurker (posts here are truly amazing, totally worth reading IMHO), this is my first post here.  \n\n\nAs the title says, I feel like I'm \"stuck\" with my photography. To give you a bit of context, I'm a 22 years old guy, who's been shooting since 2016 mainly for passion (with a few commissions here and there). I've tried many genres, but the ones that make me still feel a burning passion are portrait and street photography.  \n\n\n I started shooting with my mother's Canon EOS-600D, and then I made the switch to a Sony A7 after 3 years. I loved my Sony, I took my best shots with her and I saw how every technical feature that new bodies have can help you get shots you have never taken before. But with all those \"help\", I've started to feel literally nothing when shooting, even if I had the most beautiful location or the most beautiful model in front of the camera.

The beautiful and well-made body, the rangefinder, the almost inaudible shutter, and the small lenses (with an image quality that I can absolutely compare to the Sigma ART and a form factor that make it so easy to carry the camera with you) made me say \"Ok, this is MY camera\".

I made a quickie guide on how to photograph our Galaxy for anyone interested in going out to do some astrophotography this season! /!/ So first a little bit about myself. I mean who would take advice from some random stranger on the internets. I am [Dan Stein](https://danieljstein.com/#/nightscapes/), I have been taking pics of the stars for over 8 years meow, and I love talking about astrophotography and helping others when it comes to their own star shots. I took my first nightscape back in college, and now I travel and take pics away from light pollution in my free time. This is my first time posting a guide here, so I hope you all enjoy!\n\n**Planning:**\n\nThe first thing you will need to go is find a dark site location. Use [this map](https://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.html#4/39.00/-98.00) to find a place near you which offers pretty dark skies, but you don't have to drive for hours to get to. I live in the suburbs of NJ and while it is difficult to find dark sites, there are a few within only an hour or so drive each way.\n\nNext up is timing. You will need to take into account the current [Moon phase](https://stardate.org/nightsky/moon) which will determine if there will be a large amount of light reflecting off the Moon when you shoot. The fuller the Moon, the more it will wash out the stars. By the next new Moon on March 13, the Core will be out in all of its glory.\n\nAnother factor of timing is rise and set times of the [Milky Way itself](https://darksitefinder.com/when-is-milky-way-season/). I took [the shot in this post](https://i.redd.it/4ycd2ufr3z061.jpg) in June for instance. In the early season like March, the Milky Way will be rising during the early hours of the night around 3-4 AM. The core will start to rise earlier and earlier with mid-july being one of the best times to shoot the core. Then it will be visible after sunset and it will be seen throughout the night. Towards September, the core will set earlier and earlier and be visible for around less than an hour before dipping below the horizon. No need to shoot just the Milky Way core though, the winter Milky Way is beautiful in its own regard, but I figured with Core season around the corner I would try to keep it focused to the Milk.\n\n**Core timing examples:**   [**March**](https://i.redd.it/yws8cqc1lkm21.jpg) |  [**June**](https://i.redd.it/gvhtd15nwik51.jpg)  |  [**September**](https://i.redd.it/8oqnxcgafnm31.jpg)\n\nThe last thing to consider before heading out into the field is weather. A clear sky is vital in seeing the stars. Even the thinnest clouds can wash them out. But, clouds are still cool to work with, and as you can see in [this shot](https://i.redd.it/4ycd2ufr3z061.jpg) they add another atmospheric element near the horizon. You just want to make sure the sky is mostly clear before heading out.\n\n**Shooting, initial settings:**\n\nOnto the camera goods. Plop your camera on a tripod and make sure it is secure. You will need to place your camera in Manual (M) mode. Set it to shoot in RAW, and use the daylight white balance setting. Manual will allow for full control of the camera, RAW will allow for better post processing (as you all probs know), and a daylight white balance is used as that is the color temperature that most represents a \"true\" night sky so it is a good starting point. RAW mode will allow that to be adjusted effortlessly in post production if the warmer tones aren't your style.\n\nNext, put your camera in the live view mode (if using a DSLR). This will blackout the optical viewfinder but make it easier to use the screen to compose your shots. Live view is also crucial for focusing which is the next step. If you have a mirrorless camera, your camera is \u201calways\u201d in live view.\n\nCrank up the ISO to about 1600-6400 depending on how dark the sky is, and open the aperture wayyyy up to the maximum possible for your lens. We are trying to let in as much light as possible since everything around you is so dim. I won't get to deep into the technicals of what is the best ISO to use for your camera and ISO invariance. I am trying to keep it simple here. Maybe I will talk about that in the future.\n\n**Focusing:**\n\nPut your lens in manual focus mode, and then try to vaguely focus by moving the focus ring to the infinity marking on your lens. If it does not have that marking, try moving the focus very slowly until stars start to make their way visible in live view.\n\nNext, find a bright star and use your tripod head to place it in the center of the live view screen. Press the little magnifying glass button on your camera which will enable a digital zoom feature on your screen. Press the button until it as big as possible on your screen. At this stage, gently rack the focus back and fourth until that star is as sharp and pinpoint as possible. This can be tricky, so be patient and if you can't find a star to work with, try a bright distant object.\n\n**Shutter speed:**\n\nAfter focusing, you will need to calculate your shutter speed. We know this Earth isn't flat so it rotates and thus too long of a shutter speed will blur the stars. But, too short of a shutter speed and the shot will come out too dim. To calculate this, we use the [NPF Rule.](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/advanced-astrophotography-shutter-time-calculator/) You may heard of the 500 rule, but as digital sensors progressed that rule became less relevant. The NPF is super precise and takes into account the many parameters of your specific setup. This is where having a wider lens will help, something between 14-24 is nice for a widefield view. Remember to take into account your crop factor if you are not shooting with a full frame camera. Something like a 70-200mm zoom is great for events or sports, but it will make your shutter speeds super short because it does not take much time for a star to move across the frame since everything is \"bigger.\"\n\nI am going to deviate for a hot second here and talk about star trackers. Some of you may have heard of these little devices, but they effectively compensate for the Earth's movement, rendering shutter speed calculation less of an issue. I would love to put together another guide later in the season which discusses these, but for now let's keep it simple. And yes, I do use one for my work.\n\n**Techniques &amp; composing:**\n\nOnce you dial in your shutter speed, start shooting! If you find the shot came out too dark, increase the ISO. If it was too bright, decrease it. Compose your shot by moving the camera on the tripod and when you are happy with a composition, turn on the camera's self timer release mode, then let it rip. The self timer will ensure there is no shakiness interrupting the shot after the shutter button is a pressed. A remote trigger will help with this too, but it is not necessary at first.\n\nAnother thing to consider when out shooting is [image stacking](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/milky-way-exposure-stacking-with-manual-alignment-in-adobe-photoshop/). If you find your shots are super noisy, you can take 10-20 shots of the same composition all back to back and merge them using software which can average out the noise and thus mitigate it. I do recommend first trying out astrophotography with single images to get the grips with imaging the stars, then factoring in stacking later on. Again, something I may think about demonstrating in a future tutorial.\n\n**Processing:**\n\nPost processing can be done in pretty much any RAW imaging software. Lightroom, Photoshop, Capture One, etc... Start with the sliders bro. Play around with the exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, white balance, etc, and see what works for you. If you shot a stack sequence, you can process that too. I think there is a lot of creative freedom to be had with post processing and you can really convey your emotions of how you feel about your shots with these powerful tools.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nRemember, everything here takes a lot of practice. If you find yourself getting discouraged or frustrated because a shot isn't working out or something is difficult, that is normal! That is a sign of learning and progress and shows you are taking steps to accomplish something new and challenge your skills. At the end of the day you are killing it!\n\nI hope this was helpful, and if you all like these posts like this I may consider doing more on this sub as well starting a blog/tutorials category on my [website.](https://www.danieljstein.com) Shoot me a comment below if you want anything clarified, and I am happy to help when I have a hot second. Also feel free to check out my [Insta @danieljstein](https://www.instagram.com/danieljstein) which is where I usually post my work and interact with the community as well.\n\nEdit: one quick thing to note about some of the shots of mine I have used as examples. They are tracked images with foreground blends (no compositing/changing up the camera direction, focal length etc.) Just using many of the techniques described here to shoot them, albeit with a tracker, something of which I would love to make a tutorial on later in the season.\n\n\\-Dan", "link":

It seemed okay, so I agreed. I read up a lot to prepare, so here are some tips for a refresher or just for getting a retrospective view from someone who just went through it.\n\n**My background**\n\nI've had a camera for I don't even know how long but I started taking photos seriously about 3 years ago. As I wrote, I like to experiment, so I shoot some portraits, some photos in zoo and on trips, tried some macro and so on. My main lens is **85mm f/1.8** (Nikon, the brand is not really important but the focal lens is). I have 24-70mm f/4 but I use it as a carry-around lens so I don't shoot much with it. I didn't have a chance to do photos indoors, except some home snaps and that is not relevant at all.\n\nI usually take tens to hundreds of photos on a shoot but I pick about the best 1%-5% for editing and the rest gets discarded.\n\nI have a flash but didn't get a chance to use it much, I know how to set it up and I did some test shots but those were all in a small room. I borrowed the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens to have more flexibility with light and focal lengths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Before the wedding day**\n\nIf you are borrowing a lens like me, **test it beforehand as much as you can**. I didn't since it was quite expensive and I don't get paid much, so I had it just for that one day. Since I usually shoot with the 85mm one, the 24mm length was giving me so much trouble. Since I am not used to it, my composition was all over the place, there was a lot of unnecessary space around the subjects and other issues which I didn't notice that much in the heat of the moment. Even though the principles can be applied in general, the focal lengths are very different and it takes some time getting used to it.\n\n**Have a chat with the main photographer**, though this went good so I don't have anything I could higlight. Discuss the regular, expectations, arrival, who shots what, delivery and compensation.\n\n**Check the equipment**, especially if you haven't used it for a while and it might need some care which may take time. My wireless trigger was dead and I fortunately had spare batteries. I had the sensor cleaned just a couple weeks ago, batteries were charged so everything was good to go.\n\n**Go see the locations if you can**. See below.\n\n**Give some tips to the couple if you know any** since they might not. I now know that I will tell brides to pay attention to the makeup/ask for light makeup from MUA. This bride had really bright highlights made on recommendation of the MUA, I could see it as soon as we met and, unsurprisingly, it was very visible in the photos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The wedding day**\n\n**Do not stress too much**. I know it's difficult and of course don't take it too lightly, but believe in your skills and experience. Stressing will just make it all worse. If you can eliminate sources of stress it can really help, for me, it was the kids at some moments and bored parents at other moments.\n\n**Check if you have actually took all the equipment**. Spare batteries, spare cards, flash, trigger, any accessories for the flash and so on. Fortunately, I didn't forget anything since I am used to getting ready from other shoots.\n\n**Check the locations before shooting**. We took some photos in the garden and there was a ugly fence so we had to move a lot. Then the sun was a problem. So going ahead, checking the background and the light might save some time. We also went early to the town hall to see the room where the ceremonies are held. We had time to store our bags, figure out the setting for the indoor photos and fortunately the light didn't change but I can see that it could cause trouble if it got suddenly cloudy and the sun became blocked.\n\n**Take time to review the photos really thoroughly** if you can. I ruined a couple of photos because I didn't pay attention to small details combined together - bad composition + skewed horizon which resulted in a bad crop.\n\n**Do not take photos at the same time as the other photographers and communicate this with the other photographer**. People get easily confused at which camera to look and that can ruin photos, especially if they are looking in different directions, and you might not notice right away on the small screen.\n\n**Don't throw away the flash completely.** The ceremony was okay, there was a plenty of light from big windows and reflecting off light walls. However, the lunch was held in a restaurant with quite a small room and right in front of small windows. The photos looked okay on the screen but not so good on a computer after import and the postprocessing was not helping much since  there was a lot of contrast. So I assume that bouncing the flash off the ceiling might have helped a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Post-processing**\n\n**Do not work on the photos immediately unless you need to process them asap.** Since I was stressed about it being the first wedding, I hated the photos as soon as I imported them. After a break, I finally found them nice.\n\n**Learn Lightroom**. It has a lot of features which will help you save a lot of time.

I primarily do pet portraits for private clients, but I've also done shoots for shelters, dog-related businesses and events. I have a background as a dog trainer and handler, so I'm confident handling dogs on shoots and getting the best out of them.  I do pretty structured shoots generally, I always meet my clients at a certain park and have different locations there I use for different shots - ie a path where I try to get the dog running towards the camera, a wildflower meadow where I do portraits with colourful bokeh in the background, etc.  You always have to improvise a bit depending on what the dog can or will do, but generally having this pre-planned structure is how I make sure I get a good variety of decent shots.\n\nI get some of my work via a friend who has a training/walking business, and he takes a small cut in exchange for advertising and booking shoots with his clients. My client this morning came via him. The dog was amazing, cute little 16 week yellow lab. The problem was the owner, a woman who brought along her young son. I started doing my usual thing but it quickly became apparent she wasn't really interested in getting shots of her dog, she wanted family photos of her and her son, in which the dog was included but not the focus.  So, I did tell her I don't generally photograph people, which is true but possibly not the best way to phrase it. I will sometimes grab a nice candid of an owner interacting with their dog, but I don't usually do posed shots with owners, and in my mind being a family photographer, and a child photographer in particular, is a different skillset, requiring different equipment/experience/plan.  I also have zero experience with handling children, and this one spent most of the shoot having a tantrum so wasn't exactly a beginner level kid.\n\nThe biggest problem we had though was her kid posing with the puppy, he would grab the pup and hug him and squeeze him tight. The puppy was visibly not comfortable with this, and as trainers we generally advise parents not to encourage their kids to hug the dog, because dogs often don't like it and that's how bites happen. So I asked the kid not to and to let the pup sit naturally with him. The kid sulked and the mum took his side, but I did - politely and firmly - say I wasn't going to photograph that and explained why.  I do also still work as a trainer sometimes, and apart from anything else I don't want photos out there attributed to me that show a dog which is clearly not happy and a practise I wouldn't advise. It could damage my reputation.  This resulted in further tantrums because the kid didn't want to take direction from me or his mum, but we got through it.\n\nSo I did my best with the shoot, and I hope I did get some shots she'll like, though I don't think they'll be as good as it she'd hired an actual family photographer. But I feel like she wasn't very happy with me and clearly didn't understand why dog shoots and family shoots aren't entirely interchangeable, and now I'm feeling like maybe I should have dropped the shoot altogether rather than trying and ending up potentially doing a half-ass job at something I'm not experienced at.  Like, I should have been firmer on the, \"Sorry, but you've hired the wrong kind of photographer\" front, because by going through with the shoot, I've kind of made a commitment to produce a certain quality of work.\n\n If the shots aren't to her liking, I feel like this is maybe going to come back on me, and the fact we had a personal disagreement during the shoot makes that feel a whole bunch more likely. I've talked to my friend who got me the job, he's at least on my side about the hugging issue so if she complains about that to him, he'll back me up. But he's not a photographer and I think he also doesn't quite get why I can't just become a family photographer for the day.\n\nThis is turning into a ramble, I guess I'm just wondering how other people would have dealt with this, or have dealt with situations where it becomes clear the client wants something different from what you usually produce.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/p2cpxb/dealing_with_a_mismatch_in_client_expectations/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "locations", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "dealing with a mismatch in client expectations /!/ so i'm a pet photographer, and i do most of my work with dogs. i primarily do pet portraits for private clients, but i've also done shoots for shelters, dog-related businesses and events. i have a background as a dog trainer and handler, so i'm confident handling dogs on shoots and getting the best out of them.  i do pretty structured shoots generally, i always meet my clients at a certain park and have different -----> locations !!!

Apologies in advance for the long post. \n\nAs mentioned in the previous post, I'm relatively new to (paid) portrait photography. My usual clients are restauranteurs, bar owners, chefs etc. and for reasons probably related to their being fixed to a location or maybe the nature of their work, I've almost never had to deal with tardiness. \n\nMy portrait clients seem to be making up for it, though. In almost all occasions, my clients arrive late. Most are within 5-10 minutes, and these are normally the ones who are extremely apologetic about it. The location I shoot in is a little difficult to navigate for first-timers, so I understand completely. These clients aren't the issue. \n\nMy issue is with the few clients who tell me they'll be a few minutes late, and leave me waiting for 45 minutes. Since a shoot with me lasts 1.5 hours, this means that they've used up half of their time. I've tried to be strict about this by telling them that I unfortunately cannot extend their time, but almost always end up feeling bad for the lack of photos produced and extend the time anyway. \n\nThe last time this happened, they wanted an evening shoot with specific locations. I planned their slot carefully around the lighting. I was actually really looking forward to the 'golden hour' pictures. \n\nThey arrived nearly 50 minutes late (basically peak sunset) and were extremely distracted throughout the entire shoot. I got home very late that night after extending the time (even though I told them I couldn't) - very upset not only about the quality of the images (worst shoot of my life, by far) but the fact that the rest of my evening's work plans (editing from other jobs, etc.) and time with my partner were ruined. \n\nThere have been other issues with this same client since the shoot, but I've handled those, and that's not the point of this question. \n\nMy question is how to go about setting boundaries with clients around lateness? At what point is it okay to send a message to cancel the shoot - do I even have a right to do that? How can I confront clients about this without coming off as bitchy, especially if I don't extend the time? \n\nThanks in advance.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/oncyg9/how_to_handle_late_clients/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "how to handle late clients? /!/ hi guys. \n\ni posted a question on etiquette about a week ago and really appreciated the quality of responses i received, so i'm here to ask yet another. apologies in advance for the long post. \n\nas mentioned in the previous post, i'm relatively new to (paid) portrait photography. my usual clients are restauranteurs, bar owners, chefs etc. and for reasons probably related to their being fixed to a -----> location !!!  or maybe the nature of their work, i've almost never had to deal with tardiness. \n\nmy portrait clients seem to be making up for it, though. in almost all occasions, my clients arrive late. most are within 5-10 minutes, and these are normally the ones who are extremely apologetic about it. the location i shoot in is a little difficult to navigate for first-timers, so i understand completely. these clients aren't the issue. \n\nmy issue is with the few clients who tell me they'll be a few minutes late, and leave me waiting for 45 minutes. since a shoot with me lasts 1.5 hours, this means that they've used up half of their time. i've tried to be strict about this by telling them that i unfortunately cannot extend their time, but almost always end up feeling bad for the lack of photos produced and extend the time anyway. \n\nthe last time this happened, they wanted an evening shoot with specific locations. i planned their slot carefully around the lighting. i was actually really looking forward to the 'golden hour' pictures. \n\nthey arrived nearly 50 minutes late (basically peak sunset) and were extremely distracted throughout the entire shoot. i got home very late that night after extending the time (even though i told them i couldn't) - very upset not only about the quality of the images (worst shoot of my life, by far) but the fact that the rest of my evening's work plans (editing from other jobs, etc.) and time with my partner were ruined. \n\nthere have been other issues with this same client since the shoot, but i've handled those, and that's not the point of this question. \n\nmy question is how to go about setting boundaries with clients around lateness? at what point is it okay to send a message to cancel the shoot - do i even have a right to do that? how can i confront clients about this without coming off as bitchy, especially if i don't extend the time? \n\nthanks in advance.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 18805, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 128152, "autor": "darol100", "date": 1627053414000, "content": "Looking for software to batch update photos/video metadata date and location /!/ [removed]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/oq4ib3/looking_for_software_to_batch_update_photosvideo/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "looking for software to batch update photos/video metadata date and -----> location !!!  /!/ [removed]", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 18839, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 128237, "autor": "Frisheid", "date": 1633333342000, "content": "I was approached by Smiler for a 'job' as tourist photographer, does anyone here have experience with them? /!/ Some guy approached me on LinkedIn saying he was looking for freelance photographers.
