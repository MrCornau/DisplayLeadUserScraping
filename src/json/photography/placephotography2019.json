My name\u2019s Stephanie. How\u2019s everyone doing tonight? \n\nIf you\u2019d like to skip over all the fluff: My website is www.spiercephotography.com and my now mostly-inactive Instagram is @spiercephotography. I\u2019m a small market Commercial Photographer (work a 3 hour radius from my house and almost the whole New England Area, so 6 states) and work in the Commercial Real Estate and Construction sectors maybe 85% of the time, with a mix of stuff among the other 15%, but it\u2019s almost all commercial/B2B.\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions anyone might have about my business or any of the fields I work in \u2026 or you can ask me about my Orchids. I love talking about- and am obsessed- with both, so :D \n\n_________________________________\n\n\nPhotography has always been part of my life, ever since I started taking photo trips with my parents in various forms at the age of 6. A few years later my Dad gave me my first SLR and I\u2019ve had a camera with me ever since. I\u2019ve always fit firmly in the \u201cNo, never! Only over my dead body!\u201d crowd when asked if I ever considered going full time, but fate had other ideas I suppose\u2026. \n\nMultiple circumstances with my health mid-2012 forced my hand, so I found a place to rent a studio, quit my job and off I went on my own with full emotional support from my family and friends without a plan or a care for the future (don\u2019t do this, be smarter than me- business planning is important!). I consider that time to be the worst of my life, because I lost so much, but also the best, because now I\u2019m a better person and still can\u2019t believe I make a living doing what I do.\n\nI did \u201cOK\u201d my first two years with what I thought (and was told) was expected of all photographers - weddings, seniors, portraits, babies, families, kids, etc. I was burnt out, bored and things weren\u2019t going too well, mostly because my heart wasn\u2019t in it. So, in 2014, I stopped listening to everyone that wanted to \u201chelp/mentor\u201d me and tell me how to run my business, and pivoted to working only on what I wanted and with who I wanted. \n\nEver since that decision, I\u2019m balls to the wall during season (March-May, August-October), and I almost exclusively work B2B and on Construction &amp; Commercial Real Estate projects- either for the General Contractor, Construction Manager, Broker or the building Owner. I love the challenge of running around behind the scenes to get the shots I (and my clients) need with full creative freedom and it\u2019s amazing to see my vision for each project come to life. Watching my clients use my photos to get new clients themselves, recognition in their fields and the project awards makes it all worth it, and it\u2019s always a hoot to see my photos show up on TV, in magazines, or on my Facebook feed too!\n\nAlmost 7 years in, I\u2019m happy, stable, kinda healthy (ongoing battle), and get hired to photograph a lot of cool places and things that the public never has access to\u2014 and I\u2019m getting paid for it!\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019m a little lower traffic than most small business photographers, since my territory/market is smaller-  but to give a general idea of what a month can look like for me, we\u2019re at the tail end of my season, things are slower- the first two weeks of October were useless (so time to rest, run errands, set doctor appointments &amp; recover!) due to cloudy weather and rain. Over the useable days of the last few weeks (October 13th through today), I\u2019ve photographed: \n\n-4 commercial real estate buildings (exteriors, repeat client since 2015) \n\n-2 small weddings (new clients, but they were referrals from wedding clients I worked with in those first 2 years) \n\n-6 reservoirs at peak fall foliage, 1 wastewater treatment plant, 1 water filtration plant, 1 hydroelectric plant, 4 various buildings, 2 hydrant flushing crews and 2 construction crews replacing water mains (new client)\n\n-3 small business shoots (through an agency, repeat client)\n\n-4 Proposals/Bids were created &amp; sent out, 1 for this year and 3 for the 2020 season.\n\n-Earlier today, I was out photographing an environmental rally and taking photos of students in front of an Inflatable hamburger!
