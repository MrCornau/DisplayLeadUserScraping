My main purpose is documenting my hikes, which I used to do with my phone, but wanted an upgrade in image quality.\n\nWith the camera, my process for dealing with the pictures has changed quite a bit, and the effort has increased significantly. I also feel like my methods aren't exactly efficient, but I'm not sure what exactly I could improve. So I'd like to collect your preferred processes and learn from them.\n\nFor the record, these are my old and current processes, respectively:\n\n**Old Process (Phone)**\n\n1. Let MS Onedrive back up the pictures from my phone.\n\n2. Create an album for that day/hike/event from the camera reel.\n\n3. Delete the bad or unsuitable pictures from the album.\n\n4. Download the album to my computer and back it up locally.\n\n**New Process**\n\n1. Insert SD Card into card reader on PC.\n\n2. Look through pictures, deleting bad ones and rating really good ones as 4/5 stars within Windows Explorer. See step 4 for relevance of the latter.\n\n3. Be annoyed with Windows 10 because Windows 7 was better and more convenient at literally everything. Be salty about lost functionality like jumping to the file from the open photo, or being able to have the preview and details pane open simultaneously, as well as being able to rate the picture from the open photo without having to switch back to the folder and looking for the current image by name to be able to rate it.\n\n4. Sort by name, manually select the RAW files corresponding to the 4-5 star rated JPEGs, and send them over to a \"Source/RAW\" folder on the hard drive (No use in keeping the mediocre RAWs).\n\n5. Send the remaining JPEGs to the Source folder.\n\n6. At this point, I would use rawtherapee to create optimal PNGs from the RAW files, but I'm still learning how to make those not look shit, so instead at this point, I edit the JPEGs that could be good but need some adjustments.\n\n7. Create an Album folder for that Day/Hike/Event and copy (not move) all the pictures over.\n\n8. Delete the ones I don't want in the Album.\n\n9. Upload the album folder to Onedrive (web, not the windows folder. I hate how that one works) for backup / sharing among family and friends.\n\n10. Optionally copy individual pictures to different folders comprising various topical favorite images like \"of my wife\", \"of my pets\", etc.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nI'm currently wasting up to around 110% extra hard drive space by copying images into various themed folders. This is not an issue yet, but might become costly in the future.\n\nThe reason I do this is that I find it the easiest method to find the pictures later, it's the most convenient form of organization to my brain, shortcuts and tags wouldn't work for uploading, and I don't trust tags.\n\nWhen I say I don't trust tags, I mean I don't want to go through hours of effort tagging images by content only to find in ten years that my new operating system doesn't know what to do with the tags I created in Windows 10, for example. Themed folders full of copied files seem much more reliable.\n\nThe downside of copy pasting is that if I alter an image later on, be it in name or the image itself, I have to apply those changes everywhere else the image is saved as well.\n\nI think the biggest issue currently is how long steps 1-6 are taking me, and I'm almost sure there has to be a better way, perhaps 3rd party software assisted. \n\nI'd also like to waste less hard drive space, and have the images thematically filed but connected.\n\nI've considered having Onedrive (web) as my canonical filing space and using their tags and albums instead of copying files, as that resolves all my issues except the futureproofing aspect (I'd hate to have to reorganize tens of thousands of pictures the day I stop using Onedrive.)\n\n**What do you do yourself?
