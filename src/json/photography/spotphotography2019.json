A mini guide on when &amp; where &amp; how to photograph the Aurora! /!/ Hi guys,\n\nThe aurora season is here again and I figured I\u2019d do a short post here regarding when &amp; where to photograph it. When I\u2019m browsing pictures on Reddit, sometimes seeing aurora pictures and checking the comment section, I see a lot of questions and responses from people that all have something to say about the northern lights (aka aurora). As someone who have seen and photographed the aurora many times, here is my little Reddit guide :).\n\n**WHERE?**\n\nThe northern lights can be seen in the arctic. Great places to see it are Iceland, Northern Norway, Northern Canada and Greenland. Basically everything within the 65-75 Latitude but during strong aurora storms they can even be seen from Scotland (which is extremely rare). There is no \u2018best\u2019 place to see the aurora. They just appear and the further north you are, the more overhead you have from the aurora. But you also have to consider weather and clear skies. There are a few \u2018hot spots\u2019 to see the aurora, but that definitely does not mean you have the most chance to see the aurora when going there. It\u2019s all about the weather! And the activity. Because if they appear, they appear all over the north and not just in 1 place.\n\n**WHEN?**\n\nThe most asked question by people who have never seen the aurora is WHEN can you see it? Well, the aurora doesn\u2019t really have an on/off switch. I\u2019ve had people telling me \u2018oh I read you can only see it from October till March, don\u2019t tell me you can see it in September, it\u2019s wrong!\u2019 The truth is: There\u2019s a chance you can see the aurora always! But it has to be dark, and without clouds. The aurora also appears in the summer months but it simply doesn\u2019t get dark up north in the summer months, so you can\u2019t see them! \n\nSo, whenever it gets dark enough during the night you\u2019ll be able to see the aurora. This means you can see the aurora from around September (but not long, because those are short nights in the north) to March. Good times to go up north to see them would be from October to February because you have enough darkness in the night. \n\nThe northern lights appear randomly. Sometimes they don\u2019t appear at all, and sometimes they\u2019re very strong. They can be there for 5 minutes, or last for the whole night. It\u2019s completely random. Saying there\u2019s a specific timeframe during the night that is best for viewing them is wrong. They can appear anytime when it\u2019s dark.\n\n**INTENSITY**\n\nAurora intensity differs a lot and is defined with a \u2018KP-number\u2019 from 0 to 10 with 0 being nothing and 10 being the craziest aurora you will ever see in your lifetime. These numbers are just an indication. I\u2019ve seen a nice aurora with KP1-2 and was sometimes disappointed with a KP4. These numbers are not always accurate but can give you an indication of chances of the aurora appearing in the sky. However, if you\u2019re up north and have a clear sky: always look up! Even with KP0 there\u2019s a chance the aurora will appear. For predictions, check [this website](http://www.aurora-service.eu/aurora-forecast/) that will give you an indication of the KP value the upcoming days.\n\nSometimes I see people saying \u2018the aurora with the naked eye is nothing like you see on some of these pictures, its all photoshopped\u2019. These are usually the people who have seen a very weak aurora and then talk like they know everything about how an aurora looks on photos. Because yes, very faint auroras (band in the sky) are very vague with the naked eye, and they appear much stronger in your photos. But a \u2018real\u2019 aurora is like seeing magic in the sky. Seeing the curtains dance in the sky is something you really have to see in real life and no photo does it justice. A really strong aurora can even be too bright to capture on camera because it\u2019s moving so fast. Aurora\u2019s are there with every intensity (more intense is more rare) and they\u2019re definitely like magic seeing them in real life!\n\n**PHOTOGRAPHING**\n\nPhotographing the aurora is not that difficult if you know how to photograph in the dark. Use a wide open aperture on your lens (preferably f/2.8 or faster, but if you don\u2019t have that, just use the lowest number). Focus on a light in the distance and lock your lens to manual focus. Do test shots and make sure the stars are pin point stars\n\nDepending on the darkness of the sky (is there a moon in the sky or not?) and the intensity of the aurora, try to photograph around ISO 800-3200 with shorter and longer shutter speeds. I\u2019m saying shorter and longer because this depends on the intensity of the aurora. If there is just a band in the sky you can easily shoot 20-30 seconds regarding exposure. But if the aurora is moving fast you want to capture much faster, with a higher ISO. Because you want to see the texture in the aurora. If you capture 30 seconds when the aurora is moving fast, you will just see a washed out green glow in the sky, which does not represent the aurora at that time.\n\nSo that\u2019s it!

well, the aurora doesn\u2019t really have an on/off switch. i\u2019ve had people telling me \u2018oh i read you can only see it from october till march, don\u2019t tell me you can see it in september, it\u2019s wrong!\u2019 the truth is: there\u2019s a chance you can see the aurora always! but it has to be dark, and without clouds. the aurora also appears in the summer months but it simply doesn\u2019t get dark up north in the summer months, so you can\u2019t see them! \n\nso, whenever it gets dark enough during the night you\u2019ll be able to see the aurora. this means you can see the aurora from around september (but not long, because those are short nights in the north) to march. good times to go up north to see them would be from october to february because you have enough darkness in the night. \n\nthe northern lights appear randomly. sometimes they don\u2019t appear at all, and sometimes they\u2019re very strong. they can be there for 5 minutes, or last for the whole night. it\u2019s completely random. saying there\u2019s a specific timeframe during the night that is best for viewing them is wrong. they can appear anytime when it\u2019s dark.\n\n**intensity**\n\naurora intensity differs a lot and is defined with a \u2018kp-number\u2019 from 0 to 10 with 0 being nothing and 10 being the craziest aurora you will ever see in your lifetime. these numbers are just an indication. i\u2019ve seen a nice aurora with kp1-2 and was sometimes disappointed with a kp4. these numbers are not always accurate but can give you an indication of chances of the aurora appearing in the sky. however, if you\u2019re up north and have a clear sky: always look up! even with kp0 there\u2019s a chance the aurora will appear. for predictions, check [this website](http://www.aurora-service.eu/aurora-forecast/) that will give you an indication of the kp value the upcoming days.\n\nsometimes i see people saying \u2018the aurora with the naked eye is nothing like you see on some of these pictures, its all photoshopped\u2019. these are usually the people who have seen a very weak aurora and then talk like they know everything about how an aurora looks on photos. because yes, very faint auroras (band in the sky) are very vague with the naked eye, and they appear much stronger in your photos. but a \u2018real\u2019 aurora is like seeing magic in the sky. seeing the curtains dance in the sky is something you really have to see in real life and no photo does it justice. a really strong aurora can even be too bright to capture on camera because it\u2019s moving so fast. aurora\u2019s are there with every intensity (more intense is more rare) and they\u2019re definitely like magic seeing them in real life!\n\n**photographing**\n\nphotographing the aurora is not that difficult if you know how to photograph in the dark. use a wide open aperture on your lens (preferably f/2.8 or faster, but if you don\u2019t have that, just use the lowest number). focus on a light in the distance and lock your lens to manual focus. do test shots and make sure the stars are pin point stars\n\ndepending on the darkness of the sky (is there a moon in the sky or not?) and the intensity of the aurora, try to photograph around iso 800-3200 with shorter and longer shutter speeds. i\u2019m saying shorter and longer because this depends on the intensity of the aurora. if there is just a band in the sky you can easily shoot 20-30 seconds regarding exposure. but if the aurora is moving fast you want to capture much faster, with a higher iso. because you want to see the texture in the aurora. if you capture 30 seconds when the aurora is moving fast, you will just see a washed out green glow in the sky, which does not represent the aurora at that time.\n\nso that\u2019s it! a short guide to the aurora for this winter. hope it was useful and happy aurora hunting :)\n\nsome examples of myself:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[panorama of a big aurora storm at kirkjufell iceland](https://i.redd.it/vtfpeasaz4n31.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[the same mountain from a different angle during a different night](https://i.redd.it/bqwfsbacz4n31.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[mirrored composition of a piece of ice, mountain and beautifully shaped aurora around the mountain. you case the little detail in the curtains. a short shutter speed was used for this](https://i.redd.it/agv94ddez4n31.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[an aurora panorama in norway. for each shot, 2 second shutter speeds were used.](https://i.redd.it/zesuhijkz4n31.jpg)", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 1155, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 98503, "autor": "sheldynbrianne", "date": 1568691028000, "content": "Photo printer suggestions?

In 2016, I was gifted an Otus 85mm 1.4 which I hoped to use for portraiture - specifically my two babies but I soon realised how tricky it was to nail manual focus on restless babies so stuck with my 24-70 which has been great. I used all the tricks in the book but found I preferred the 24-70 especially when out and about. These days, I still use the Otus a lot but have restricted it's use mainly to portraits of adults, scenery and other things which don't move and giggle constantly when the camera is pointed at them. One issue I noticed with the D800 is the MF focus assist seems to be designed for F2.8 lenses, not F1.4 so as a result, even if the focus indicator was on, the subjects' eye could be front or back focused. To address this, I setup my focus assist adjustment so that the focus assist light turning from a flicker to on would indicate the F1.4 MF being in the sweet spot. So far this hack has worked brilliantly but far from ideal.\n\nFast forward some time, I am thinking about getting a new camera body, preferably one which I can use with the F-mount Otus and one which has accurate manual focus assist tools such as focus peeking.

Originally i though it was only affecting my x-t100, however i have since found hundreds of accounts from  people owning nearly every fuji x series camera who has had similar experiences. My original post follows\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short I have decided to switch  from a Nikon d7100 to Fuji mirrorless, and I got an x-t100 to play with  to see if its what I want. Its a lightly used camera (\\~1500 shots  judging from image numbers) and physically appears to be in perfect  condition. Ive been loving it so far, however tonight I noticed  something.\n\nI  stopped by a park on my way home tonight to test long exposures, I do them frequently and good performance is necessary for me. It was a brisk  evening, camera was cold, and I only took five or so 15-25 second  exposures, 400ish iso, f/5.6, LENR ON (although it doesnt seam to do a  dark subtraction image after the shot like normal, so what does this  option even do?) with generally a minute or two of cool down time  between the shots as I was walking around.\n\nAfter  checking out the images in photoshop I was generally pleased with the  results, noise levels are great and quality is fantastic. Until i zoomed  in, and noticed every image is COVERED in bright white, red, and blue  specs. Most noticeable in the shadows of course, but they exist  everywhere. Now obviously SOME hot spots are to be expected, but this is  something I have never seen before with any other camera I have ever  owned.\n\nHere are 100% crop examples from  the first two photos I took, shot in raw, processed in photoshop cc  2019 with no exposure adjustments, only minor color correction. Notice  the black shadowed area in the second shot especially, this is not  something that can be easily touched up in post. **Also note that imgur compresses the hell out of images on mobile, so try to view it on a PC otherwise you might not see the problem**\n\n[https://imgur.com/ICgyHSr](https://imgur.com/ICgyHSr)\n\n[https://imgur.com/7uko7UP](https://imgur.com/7uko7UP)\n\nAnd  here is an intentionally under exposed image I used to test shadow  recovery from the raw files (+3 stops). Noise is to be expected, the  resulting confetti however was not. It completely ruins any image that  needs to be brightened, even a +1 stop adjustment makes these things pop  out like crazy.\n\n[https://imgur.com/TM2MIcO](https://imgur.com/TM2MIcO)\n\nSo  I did a little simple test with both the x-t100 and my Nikon d7100.  Both cameras cold, sitting inside and havnt been used in hours. Turn  them on, take a 30 second exposure at iso 200 with the lens cap on,  aperture f/22, both shooting raw. Then pop the images into photoshop,  and simply bump the exposure +5 stops to exaggerate what is going on  here. No other changes were made, everything else was left at default 0.\n\nFirst  the Nikon, this is exactly what I would expect, a bit of heat noise, a  couple of light hot spots. Nothing was noticeable until doing the  exposure bump. You can not see 99% of these in an actual image\n\n[https://imgur.com/5DO3NzV](https://imgur.com/5DO3NzV)\n\nThen  the Fuji, which if I didnt know better I would assume is a hubble deep  field image of space. What the heck is wrong with this sensor? You can  even see most of it without any exposure adjustment, and they show up over actual images even in bright areas.\n\n[https://imgur.com/DCiUvp2](https://imgur.com/DCiUvp2)\n\nOther  than the handful of hot spots you would expect from any digital sensor,  my Nikon has never exhibited anything like this. And most importantly  the heat noise and specks it creates are not visible in actual images,  whereas with the Fuji they are extremely noticeable and there are THOUSANDS of them. Here is a 30 second exposure taken with my Nikon  after several hours of shooting in 90+ degree weather last summer. The  camera was hot, I had shot probably 20+ long exposures up to this one  catching the sunset and it was hot outside. As you can see there are one  or two noticeable hot spots as you would expect, and otherwise there is  nothing.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bvpphotos/42200196415/sizes/o/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bvpphotos/42200196415/sizes/o/)\n\nThis  vs the 15 second cold exposure I posted above from the Fuji that is absolutely covered in spots is a drastic difference.

She's really blown up the past 2-3 years and has basically a wedding every weekend. She's done amazingly and will continue to grow and gain more clients, etc. She's doing everything perfectly and is really developing into an awesome small-business owner as well as a better technical photographer. \n\nBut...she won't embrace using lenses \"situationally\". Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with having reliable work-horses that she's comfortable with, and she's definitely crushing it with them. But, she's gotten to where she uses a 24-70mm, 70-200mm, or 35mm 1.4 for everything (100mm 2.8 macro tossed in for detail shots). I have always been a gear-head, and worked in marketing many years ago and got to use a ton of nice equipment that my company let me buy/rent/etc. I am by no means a great photographer, but I understand the possible \"sweet spots\" for using different lenses in different situations. I've been trying to get my wife to experiment and play around with some other lenses for situations where it can help; for example, when doing some architectural/portrait/event type shoots, I keep telling her to implement some time with the 16-35mm lens to grab some more dramatic/creative shots on the wide-end, but she's afraid to move away from her 24-70 lens for even a few minutes. She always complains that her shots of a couple in front a barn (for example), didn't \"come out\" the way she pictured them, or thought they would. I explained to her that it's because the focal length is making the couple look teeny tiny in front of this massive barn, and 7/8ths of the width of the shot show this huge barn while the details of her couple get lost. This results in her either cropping the photo so tightly that you lose the aesthetic of the barn/setting, or so widely that you can barely make out the couple's faces/details (clothing, etc). I explained to her that if she uses a wider angle lens, she can get closer to catch the couple's details while fully maintaining the barn on the perimeters of the shot, albeit a bit distorted (which she can reduce a bit in PP/crop). The barn is the secondary feature of the photo after all, so it being a bit barreled on the edges is OK in some cases (again, just an example). I've seen dozens of shots of hers that really, really would have benefitted from a wider lens, but she's terrified that the photos are all going to look clown-house and distorted, even though I've explained to her that it can be addressed in PP, and that the 16-35mm III L lens is much better at that than earlier revisions. She's picturing everything coming out fish-eyed, but that's definitely not the case.\n\nSorry for the too-much-background post, but I've decided that showing her some shots comparing the 16-35 to the 24-70 would be a good way to get her to adopt the 16-35 for certain shots. Focal lengths for portraits/architecture is most important, not concerned about actual image quality, as the 24-70mm II is almost certainly better in terms of color/quality/sharpness across the full range, etc.\n\nDoes anyone have any good links or resources comparing the effect of using a wider lens vs a standard zoom in these situations? I want to show her that the wider lens won't make things look clown-housed, and can really work to her benefit when she wants to accentuate a subject against a large background.

Droplets had been showing up for a few months now and I\u2019d have to do more and more frequent cleanings.

I heavily enjoy the process of the craft and hold a good chunk of photos from even being shared on the internet just for my personal enjoyment. *I do* however, see it as a possible method of generating monitization and potential business and although I am a shit businessman and could do better to market myself in general and through other means I still hold these opinions.\n\nI wanted to talk about something that has been on my mind of late after spotting some drama over some photo contests.

I think the problem with these pages is now photographers are having their hard work **belittled and stolen**. I am noticing more and more that the actual photographers are hardly getting any recognition besides an @ or tag. These pages may have started out a few years ago as methods to showcase great work and stimulate growth but that is no longer what they are today. In my own experience I have broken over 5k likes on a feature page yet received negligible profile growth or recognition and I have seen this to continually be the case with many photographers who are not already blue check verified on social media.\n\nWith the increasing filtering by algorithms we as photographers have been digging our own graves. I see more and more on the 'nature' tab and in explore in general just post after post from these feature pages. It has become so hard to just stumble upon a new photographer or profile without going through these feature pages and finding the obscure links to the actual photographer. Now, I am a shitty businessman but I know that as a photographer I can't have my fan and client base be all photographers. In order to actually generate genuine growth I have to appeal to other audiences. How easy is it going to be to reach out to non-photographers when I as a photographer, am already looking for other photographers to inspire me **yet barely ever see posts from an actual photographer show up via the algorithm**. **These pages are taking our opportunities at monetization, increased business and growth**. \n\nSo why is this a rant on the state of sharing work and photography instead of just social media? Because **we** are the ones who brought things to this state! All I see are these superficial fake comments by photographers just looking to push their way up the algorithms. It's almost impossible to have a legitimate conversation with someone or discuss their work. Everything seems about fame and not genuine connection. I recently moved across the county and in 6 months I have failed to find a photographer in a similar skill bracket to work with and grow with together. **Collaboration pushes our growth as artists and somehow we have seemingly lost that mindset**. All these hubs/ cliques are all about generating traffic instead of actually having genuine critique and enthusiasm about other's work. I totally understand people enjoying solace and working alone but I would love to just be able to meet up and be pushed to try new things and learn new techniques and see things from others point of view.\n\nI just wish all the superficiality (word check?) would dissipate. Yes, I want to make photography/ visual arts a career and make monies but working with other people just makes everyone grow better and faster.

I'll be starting with cyanotypes due to their accessibility and striking results. If there's any interest, I'd love to cover some more alternative processes. \n\n**~~~ What is a Cyanotype? ~~~**\n\nCyanotype is an early printing process that creates characteristically blue images. [Photograms](https://imgur.com/Oc4gYYe) are some of the earliest works made, and is simply an object in contact with a paper coated in a photosensitive solution. \n\nThe chemicals used react to UV light and can be applied onto basically any surface that absorbs it. Areas exposed to sunlight will turn blue, while areas blocked will stay white. After an image is exposed, the chemicals are developed in water. [Blueprints](https://www.google.com/search?q=cyanotype+blueprint&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjai6KY8MfiAhUJZKwKHSUUD_sQsAR6BAgGEAE&amp;biw=1375&amp;bih=1068) and [Anna Atkins *British Algae*](http://exhibitions.nypl.org/treasures/items/show/49) are some famous examples using cyanotypes.\n\n**~~~ Materials ~~~**\n\n* [**Liquid Cyanotype Kit**](https://www.freestylephoto.biz/070091-Formulary-Liquid-Cyanotype-Kit-1-Liter) - Most kits run $25 and come in dry and liquid form. The one I linked comes with an 'A' and 'B' solution that are mixed 1:1 then painted on.\n* **Printing Medium** - Strathmore Watercolor / Mixed Media paper is a decent starting point, but basically anything works. I've had good results printing onto 100% cotton shirts if that's your style.\n* **Transparency / Negatives** - If you shoot film, large and medium format negatives work great for contact printing. If you want to print a digital photo, I'll share a cost effective tip below for making transparencies.\n* **Miscellaneous** -  Trays for developing prints. Brush for applying the solution. [Contact printing frame](http://stores.photoformulary.com/contact-print-frame/) / sheets of glass to hold paper.\n\n**~~~ Transparencies ~~~**\n\nIf you're just starting out, I'd recommend making a [photogram](https://imgur.com/P2Zvs8t). Essentially, you're just placing objects right on top of the paper for a silhouette. \n\nIf you want to try an actual image, here's how we've made transparencies from digital photos. I'll be using this example the whole way through.\n\n* [Select an image\n](https://imgur.com/Xea3NO0)\n* [Convert to B&amp;W and Invert](https://imgur.com/QvTBv0L) - I generally bump the contrast up a bit as well.\n* Print your photo out - Cheap printer paper works fine\n* Coat in baby oil - The oil will immediately turn your paper translucent. No need to soak it, just a light coating works. Use a paper towel to rub it in on the backside to avoid rubbing away ink.\n* Dry inbetween paper towels and / or hang to dry.\n\nEnd result should basically be a paper negative of your photo. If you can see your hand through the image, you're good. These are reusable, and can be used for other alternative photography processes.\n\n**~~~ Making a Cyanotype ~~~**\n\nI'll be making an 8x10 print of the example image above for this walkthrough. Steps are basically all the same regardless of what you're printing on.\n\n* **Mix cyanotype solution with a 1:1 ratio.** This should be done indoors, away from sunlight. The solution doesn't react with normal lightbulbs, so I wouldn't stress about working in pitch black. Start with a small amount and mix more as needed, excess can also be stored for later. \n* **Brush the solution onto your paper.** The chemicals should look yellow when you apply it. Foam brushes give a more even coating, but bristle brushes can give you an interesting texture. \n* **Dry the solution.** Hair dryer works fine for this, you'll want it dry to the touch. Generally only takes ~30 seconds unless you've got a really absorbent paper or put too much on.\n* **Lay your negative on top of the paper.** Any kind of photo frame is a godsend for this, but can be a bit costly. Cheaper option is  to sandwich your paper and negative inbetween two sheets of glass and secure with binder clips. You may have to get creative with this.\n* **Put your cyanotypes in the sun.** Lots of variables will effect your exposure time, so I can't give you an exact number. Proper technique is to make test strips to determine the exact time, but I'm too lazy for that. On a sunny day, I just leave it out for 10 minutes and adjust from there. I've gone up to 20-30 minutes on cloudier days.\n* **Develop in water.** Bring your print inside and take a look. Lighter areas should still look yellow, while areas exposed to the sun should have turned blue. Submerge the print in a container of water and the yellow should wash away, while the blue darkens. \n* **Optional: Hydrogen Peroxide.** If your image looks a bit flat, add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to a tray full of water and submerge your print. Word of warning, it'll darken very quickly and can be somewhat hard to control.\n\n* **Finished!** If you've made it this far, you're done! You can leave your print to soak for a bit before drying, the chemicals only \"develop\" so much. Chances are, the exposure isn't going to be exactly spot on first try. Once you get a feel for it, it's pretty easy to guesstimate times.\n\n[My finished photo](https://imgur.com/undefined) and [Original\n](https://imgur.com/Xea3NO0). Looks less funky in person, my cameras making it look grainier than it is. \n\n**~~~ Conclusion ~~~**\n\nHopefully someone else finds this as interesting as I have. I think Cyanotypes are a great, cheap, method of making cool looking prints at home with very little material cost. \n\nFor anyone interested in the science behind cyanotypes, [NileRed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYqn8CO2P3E) has a fantastic video where he makes his own solution and makes a couple of prints as well. His standards are also much higher than mine, so definitely worth the watch.\n\nIf anyone actually tries this out, please post your results!

Tl;dr at the end. If you are metering and adjusting your exposure before every shot, there is no reason to use manual exposure.  The only time manual exposure provides any advantage over a priority mode is if you are not using the camera's meter (in which case manual is a necessity), if you want to maintain a consistent exposure over a series of shots where the luminance of your scene is changing (as with taking a series of shots to stitch into a panorama) or if you need to expose more than 3 stops away from 0 on your meter. Otherwise, it makes way more sense to couple your meter to one of your settings.\n\nI will explain further.  There seems to be some misunderstanding that the camera is executing some kind of decision making process in the automatic modes. While this is true in the \"intelligent auto\" or scene detect modes, it is not true in aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual with auto iso (which, if you are shooting manual with auto iso you aren't shooting manual so stop frontin').  What the camera is actually doing is taking a meter reading and then setting one theparameter it has control over to obtain an average luminance value of 18% given the parameters set by the user. \n\nHere is an example: Let's say you are in aperture priority and you set the aperture at f/8 and the iso at 100.  The camera will meter the scene, and set the shutter at whatever shutter speed will give it a meter reading of 18% luminance. There is no \"decision\" making going on here.  It is just taking a meter reading and setting the shutter to get that 18%.  Same thing, every single time.\n\n\"BUT WAIT,\" you say, \"complicated lighting can fool the meter!\" Wrong. The meter never gets fooled. You may not understand what it is doing, and it may not return the exposure you want, but that is your fault, not the meter's. What the meter is doing is sampling the scene and then averaging the samples to get to that 18%.  Matrix will be a wider sample than center weighted (which will also be center weighted, obviously)  which will be a wider sample than partial, which will be a wider sample than spot. Regardless, its just sample and average, that's it.  If +/- 0 is giving you a reading that leads to an exposure that you don't like, it will do so whether you are reading the meter and setting the exposure manually, or whether you are in a priority mode.\n\n\"BUT WAIT,\" you say, \"in manual I have total control, in aperture priority I don't.\" Wrong again.  This is what exposure compensation is for. When you are in a priority mode, the ec dial directly controls whatever setting you have delegated to the camera.  So in aperture priority mode, the ec dial controls the shutter speed, in shutter priority it controls the aperture. You can also see what setting the camera has selected.  Inserting yourself between the meter and the shutter provides no advantage. The disadvantage is that the camera would set the shutter speed instantaneously and you will not.\n\nAnother example: Let's say you are in aperture priority and set your aperture to f/5.6 and iso to 100.  Let's say that the camera sets the shutter at 1/60.  This is too slow, though, because you are handholding a 200mm lens.  You have some choices.  You could use the ec dial to change your shutter speed, which will also change your overall exposure.  Or, you could raise your iso to 400 and your shutter will automatically go to 1/250, maintaining the exposure. This is a huge advantage because in manual you would have to manipulate two controls, but in the priority mode you only have to manipulate one. You still have full control over each setting in the priority mode, though, and if you want to raise or lower your overall exposure you absolutely can.\n\nYou can also use EC preemptively to tell your camera what exposure you want.  For example, if my subject is a caucasian human I will typically want her face to render at 1 stop brighter than 18% luminance.  In this case I can set to aperture priority and +1 on the ec dial.  I can then spot meter the subject's face and the camera will set a shutter speed that will give me an exposure in which the subject's face is 1 stop brighter than 18%.  If I were in manual I would be adjusting the shutter every shot until the meter read +1. If I want to go a little ore low key for some shots, I just drop that ec dial down.\n\nIf you only ever shoot manual, you aren't using all the tools at your disposal and you are probably slowing yourself down substantially in situations where it's not necessary to do so.  I don't really give a crap what any other photographer does, but it wold be nice if people would stop telling the novices on this board that the priority modes somehow give you less control than manual because it isn't true.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/cpvnso/manual_mode_is_dumb/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "manual mode is dumb /!/ ok, that's a clickbait title but hear me out. tl;dr at the end. if you are metering and adjusting your exposure before every shot, there is no reason to use manual exposure.  the only time manual exposure provides any advantage over a priority mode is if you are not using the camera's meter (in which case manual is a necessity), if you want to maintain a consistent exposure over a series of shots where the luminance of your scene is changing (as with taking a series of shots to stitch into a panorama) or if you need to expose more than 3 stops away from 0 on your meter. otherwise, it makes way more sense to couple your meter to one of your settings.\n\ni will explain further.  there seems to be some misunderstanding that the camera is executing some kind of decision making process in the automatic modes. while this is true in the \"intelligent auto\" or scene detect modes, it is not true in aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual with auto iso (which, if you are shooting manual with auto iso you aren't shooting manual so stop frontin').  what the camera is actually doing is taking a meter reading and then setting one theparameter it has control over to obtain an average luminance value of 18% given the parameters set by the user. \n\nhere is an example: let's say you are in aperture priority and you set the aperture at f/8 and the iso at 100.  the camera will meter the scene, and set the shutter at whatever shutter speed will give it a meter reading of 18% luminance. there is no \"decision\" making going on here.  it is just taking a meter reading and setting the shutter to get that 18%.  same thing, every single time.\n\n\"but wait,\" you say, \"complicated lighting can fool the meter!\" wrong. the meter never gets fooled. you may not understand what it is doing, and it may not return the exposure you want, but that is your fault, not the meter's. what the meter is doing is sampling the scene and then averaging the samples to get to that 18%.  matrix will be a wider sample than center weighted (which will also be center weighted, obviously)  which will be a wider sample than partial, which will be a wider sample than -----> spot !!!

What are the reasons for your choice? Does anyone here use both digital &amp; film? I will explain my reasoning for using mostly film but also digital, and others can chip in why they have their preference(s) /!/ Before I start, I will state that I do not believe either is 'better' or 'worse' than the other. I personally, am primarily a film user even on social nights (analog from photo to print or on cine film in the case of motion pictures, with scanning of final prints for further sharing or to recover photos that are hard to print in the darkroom via negative scanning), though prefer digital for action photography. This is all subjective, and is in no way an authority on anything ;)\n\n# Film Advantages for me\n\nMy reasons for choosing film as a primary medium (colour and black-and-white, darkroom all the way, apart from sharing and digital softcopy as backup/recovery and use digital action photography or extreme handheld low light photography where film falls apart) despite being the age of 24 born into the 'modern' time: I primarily take photos of social nights at houses/people with a lot of candid shots, landscapes, streets, and objects as an art form to give away to people, and have done odd jobs photographing events for people. \n\nI often use black-and-white, and gelatin-silver prints are just beautiful. It gets me off the PC for a while, and I can sit in the darkroom with an audiobook or music with my phone in a light-tight bag for this purpose. A time to zone out, even when doing prints on a paid basis for someone else and can do very good quality prints and can get my hands in there. I also love playing with chemistry, this is an added bonus. Watching the print appear in the tray under red-light is magical and this cannot be reproduced in any other way, no other process will match this in beauty. \n\nI have to think before I press the shutter, which is another reason why I like the darkroom. Even with digital, I also prefer manual focus. No other way to make gelatin silver prints even from digital masters at home on the cheap, whereas enlargers are very cheap. A darkroom setup will cost far less than a high end digital printer, and will enable you to do C-Type prints or gelatin-silver prints of insane enlargements with far lower costs. Ideal if you want full control over the process.\n\nI like the fact that film is forgiving when a shoe-flash is used, and it means I will use low ISO in poor lighting and will play around with flash filters etc, highlights are often perfectly retained with very little effort with negative film, split grade printing in the darkroom brings out highlights with ease and retains detail in the shadows, and is simple, quick and intuitive to do, on a film such as Ilford FP4+ and Ilford PAN 100. An example of this is a picture on a self-timer of me and my friend perfectly framed, with the handmade chessboard with us playing. The shadows and the black pieces and the white pieces with the highlights retain all their detail with ease and very little effort. I often develop in Ilford ID11 1+1, and mostly shoot 35mm with an SLR, though I have a couple of high quality compacts. I also use T-Grain films such as Tmax.\n\nI like that fun candid moments will appear only when we develop, giving an element of surprise for the others who may wish to see it. People end up with physical prints with social evenings from me. One of my good Chinese friends had a carefully crafted photo album when he left the UK for china at the end of his time here. \n\nAs for colour, I do shoot film for colour and process E6 myself, but mostly as transparencies. Nothing beats all gathering round a slide projector, and watching as your images have insane detail on the wall/screen. As transparencies are shot as-is, you compose the shot perfectly at the time. Very little post-processing is needed, short of playing with developer pH if you are playing around with that, or tweaking scans of the transparencies. Digital scanning if you want prints made of transparencies. \n\nTransparencies however are NOT at all forgiving with almost zero latitude, so your exposure is either spot on, or done for, especially if projection is your desired result. I shoot some colour negative film as well, and print RA4 in the darkroom, though with quite a bit of colour work, especially when I need to tweak the final image a bit, I adopt a hybrid workflow, scanning negatives and printing them digitally. \n\nHP Instant Ink has pushed the cost of creating good quality colour prints of A4 size or lower down at home. Using a flash or low-light social evenings with transparencies can be suicide unless you are very well-versed, and it would be advisable to bracket. I use Provia for this purpose, for it allows me to push +1 stop in processing with virtually no quality loss, and will allow +2 stops even, giving me a 400 speed high quality transparency film, which is enough if I shoot wide open. The discontinuation of Provia 400X was a loss, for this could give very good slides at 800 speed.\n\nWith big paper rolls, you can do it for as little as 4 pence a sheet, only your time and sanity calibrating colour filtration are needed. Hand-made RA4 prints in trays are satisfying. You can use a very dim orange safelight with a 7 1/2 watt bulb for colour papers or a calibrated lamp at 590nm wavelength at a distance, so your not in total darkness for colour prints. I also have a LED torch at similar wavelength.\n\nPaper cost is cheap, especially if you grab lots of 'partially used' paper boxes from people abandoning darkrooms or who have excess. Recently grabbed over 1000 sheets of different sizes for \u00a350. Chemistry is cheap, even ensuring all my fixer is only used for one session and replaced. \n\nI press the shutter, and it will fire instantly if it is armed, no quirks, no menus, no dying batteries from leaving a camera on constantly throughout the night. I can often focus from memory with little problems, and with a flash and a high F stop always gives me the focus I need and i will keep it set at an approximated setting if I think people are about to do something stupid. I find the lack of ANY delay whatsoever has given me candid moments that I may have missed otherwise, including a friend falling through a chair with her eyes crossed that happened so suddenly. The very act of turning a DSLR on or your phone app opening will often make you miss such a moment.\n\nSome digital cameras can be set this way, but I like the simplicity of leaving an armed camera within reach with no battery drain, and as such often carry a disposable on nights out to leave lying around and take many candid shots on my SLR. This quality enabled my friend to make me jump while carrying tea, and get the moment in perfect action with the water coming out of the cup (taken on a good quality disposable). Would not have been possible to hold a DSLR up without giving away what he was going to do. And 8x10 enlargement with good enough detail was possible.\n\nEquipment lifespan. Still am able to use the same film SLR as I was in 2010 when I first got into film.\n\nNegatives will always be view able, I suspect long before raw digital file formats of today become hard to open. I treat a negative as I would a digital raw file. It was my love for film that meant all my digital work is shot in raw, no questions asked, though for me to tweak the process. It has also made me careful even with a DSLR and I will seldom fill a card unless I am doing 4K video.\n\n# Film Disadvantages for me\n\nPointless for action photography when you try and take many. Reloading film during action will cause you to miss the action, 36 exposures (35mm) is not enough for an action session. A memory card can hold way more than that The high ISOs with high shutter speeds needed if in lower light will result in far lower quality on film unless you have good lighting, as film above ISO 400 - 800 can be very grainy and can look very nice if developed properly with a look you want, but unless your using medium format or large format will fall apart if you try and make big enlargements of such a film. The loss of Provia 400X was a blow here when it was discontinued. I am glad kodak bought back TMax 3200 however, for this was very good in poor light for 12x16 enlargements and may have me revisit film for this purpose.\n\nLow light performance of digital in terms of raw quality will outstrip film, and will probably run rings around it if you do not wish to use a flash. Trying to shoot an ISO 3200 film with the lens stopped all the way open and trying to focus a gathering with a very narrow depth of field is like walking on a tightrope, though is perfectly doable, and I have done it. A decent DSLR could give you better quality and an extra stop or two of speed if you require it.\n\nDust, dust, dust. Trying to get dust off a negative while printing it. A single tiny hair you did not see while preparing the print? Time to make a new one. I use a condenser enlarger, further compounding this problem. This is probably for me the biggest gripe. Digital is less stressful in this regard. And sometimes, my sanity can be tested. I now run an air purifier and ensure darkrooms are kept as clean as possible, but still... trying to remove dust from your negative is a nighmare straight from the depths of hell. Black-and-White films (apart from C41 ones) cannot make use of digital ICE due to the silver content when scanning, though you can correct for this in photoshop.\n\nNegatives are fragile. You must care for them and handle them with care if you want to make more gelatin silver prints. Digital media is far more robust. Use digital for backup high-resolution scans, always. I keep all mine filed, and have often had to go back to certain negatives more than once when people want more prints for someone else.\n\nDigital is a one-time purchase for equipment and software bar paper and consumables or lab printing, and if you are not to worry about printing most of your work, is probably the way to go unless you enjoy film workflow for other reasons. My Nikon DSLR has given flawless service bar needing a new battery. Film has on-going costs, but these are not too bad if you process at home and scan at home.\n\nScanning in good quality is time consuming if you have many photos. Digital can have a more streamlined workflow, if you need to do a high quantity of good quality pictures, as you need not prepare every print once you have calibrated your print.\n\nSharing with the world, need I say more? The very act of sharing photos here is a hybrid solution even if film is used.\n\nNot as small as the smallest digital cameras if size really does matter, though a lightweight disposable can be good, but unless you want it for the candid value, your smartphone would probably do better if you have a flagship model or reasonable model.\n\nHP Instant Ink and other similar services have started to close the gap on the cost magins, though premium digital papers are still expensive. I do not use no-name or cheap digital paper, I want the print to be stable long-term so when people view memories made by me decades later, it will still look as good as the day we shot it. \n\nThe need to carry multiple cameras if you wish to shoot both colour/black-and-white at the same event.

A discontinuation of a favourite film stock is heartbreaking if you have not already stocked up, ebay prices will then go into the stratosphere. Provia 400X was one such example, and I am resigned to the fact Fuji will discontinue Provia 100F, which is my favourite for colour work due to my liking of transparencies. My freezer has quite a bit of it. \n\nDifficult to find people who understand a darkroom process and digital post may be more time efficient depending on the skill of the operator, thus for most professional work unless you want your own darkroom, digital is the way to go.\n\n# Summary\n\nFilm being my favourite, I have room for both Digital and Film in my work. Both can be fun in their own way, depending on the workflow you want. As being sat in front of screen is not something I enjoy too much for long hours, especially as I do a lot of writing and thus spend a lot of time in front of a screen, I like the darkroom as a getaway from that.\n\nDigital has advantages mentioned above that film cannot compete with in my opinion, though to be both are simply tools in your box that you may use as you wish, and other experiences may differ from mine. As silver gelatin prints, and project able transparencies are often my end goal, film therefore suits me. Projectable colour cine film is also a fun addition.\n\nA digital softcopy/backup is essential for your good work, regardless if you wish to share it or not. I often scan my prints over my negatives, as I have to do very little correction.\n\nJust had too much time on my hands today!\n\nSo what do you prefer guys, and why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ap9ltl/photographers_of_reddit_do_you_prefer_digital/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "photographers of reddit, do you prefer digital, film/darkroom or hybrid for your workflow? what are the reasons for your choice? does anyone here use both digital &amp; film? i will explain my reasoning for using mostly film but also digital, and others can chip in why they have their preference(s) /!/ before i start, i will state that i do not believe either is 'better' or 'worse' than the other. i personally, am primarily a film user even on social nights (analog from photo to print or on cine film in the case of motion pictures, with scanning of final prints for further sharing or to recover photos that are hard to print in the darkroom via negative scanning), though prefer digital for action photography. this is all subjective, and is in no way an authority on anything ;)\n\n# film advantages for me\n\nmy reasons for choosing film as a primary medium (colour and black-and-white, darkroom all the way, apart from sharing and digital softcopy as backup/recovery and use digital action photography or extreme handheld low light photography where film falls apart) despite being the age of 24 born into the 'modern' time: i primarily take photos of social nights at houses/people with a lot of candid shots, landscapes, streets, and objects as an art form to give away to people, and have done odd jobs photographing events for people. \n\ni often use black-and-white, and gelatin-silver prints are just beautiful. it gets me off the pc for a while, and i can sit in the darkroom with an audiobook or music with my phone in a light-tight bag for this purpose. a time to zone out, even when doing prints on a paid basis for someone else and can do very good quality prints and can get my hands in there. i also love playing with chemistry, this is an added bonus. watching the print appear in the tray under red-light is magical and this cannot be reproduced in any other way, no other process will match this in beauty. \n\ni have to think before i press the shutter, which is another reason why i like the darkroom. even with digital, i also prefer manual focus. no other way to make gelatin silver prints even from digital masters at home on the cheap, whereas enlargers are very cheap. a darkroom setup will cost far less than a high end digital printer, and will enable you to do c-type prints or gelatin-silver prints of insane enlargements with far lower costs. ideal if you want full control over the process.\n\ni like the fact that film is forgiving when a shoe-flash is used, and it means i will use low iso in poor lighting and will play around with flash filters etc, highlights are often perfectly retained with very little effort with negative film, split grade printing in the darkroom brings out highlights with ease and retains detail in the shadows, and is simple, quick and intuitive to do, on a film such as ilford fp4+ and ilford pan 100. an example of this is a picture on a self-timer of me and my friend perfectly framed, with the handmade chessboard with us playing. the shadows and the black pieces and the white pieces with the highlights retain all their detail with ease and very little effort. i often develop in ilford id11 1+1, and mostly shoot 35mm with an slr, though i have a couple of high quality compacts. i also use t-grain films such as tmax.\n\ni like that fun candid moments will appear only when we develop, giving an element of surprise for the others who may wish to see it. people end up with physical prints with social evenings from me. one of my good chinese friends had a carefully crafted photo album when he left the uk for china at the end of his time here. \n\nas for colour, i do shoot film for colour and process e6 myself, but mostly as transparencies. nothing beats all gathering round a slide projector, and watching as your images have insane detail on the wall/screen. as transparencies are shot as-is, you compose the shot perfectly at the time. very little post-processing is needed, short of playing with developer ph if you are playing around with that, or tweaking scans of the transparencies. digital scanning if you want prints made of transparencies. \n\ntransparencies however are not at all forgiving with almost zero latitude, so your exposure is either -----> spot !!!  on, or done for, especially if projection is your desired result. i shoot some colour negative film as well, and print ra4 in the darkroom, though with quite a bit of colour work, especially when i need to tweak the final image a bit, i adopt a hybrid workflow, scanning negatives and printing them digitally. \n\nhp instant ink has pushed the cost of creating good quality colour prints of a4 size or lower down at home. using a flash or low-light social evenings with transparencies can be suicide unless you are very well-versed, and it would be advisable to bracket. i use provia for this purpose, for it allows me to push +1 stop in processing with virtually no quality loss, and will allow +2 stops even, giving me a 400 speed high quality transparency film, which is enough if i shoot wide open. the discontinuation of provia 400x was a loss, for this could give very good slides at 800 speed.\n\nwith big paper rolls, you can do it for as little as 4 pence a sheet, only your time and sanity calibrating colour filtration are needed. hand-made ra4 prints in trays are satisfying. you can use a very dim orange safelight with a 7 1/2 watt bulb for colour papers or a calibrated lamp at 590nm wavelength at a distance, so your not in total darkness for colour prints. i also have a led torch at similar wavelength.\n\npaper cost is cheap, especially if you grab lots of 'partially used' paper boxes from people abandoning darkrooms or who have excess. recently grabbed over 1000 sheets of different sizes for \u00a350. chemistry is cheap, even ensuring all my fixer is only used for one session and replaced. \n\ni press the shutter, and it will fire instantly if it is armed, no quirks, no menus, no dying batteries from leaving a camera on constantly throughout the night. i can often focus from memory with little problems, and with a flash and a high f stop always gives me the focus i need and i will keep it set at an approximated setting if i think people are about to do something stupid. i find the lack of any delay whatsoever has given me candid moments that i may have missed otherwise, including a friend falling through a chair with her eyes crossed that happened so suddenly. the very act of turning a dslr on or your phone app opening will often make you miss such a moment.\n\nsome digital cameras can be set this way, but i like the simplicity of leaving an armed camera within reach with no battery drain, and as such often carry a disposable on nights out to leave lying around and take many candid shots on my slr. this quality enabled my friend to make me jump while carrying tea, and get the moment in perfect action with the water coming out of the cup (taken on a good quality disposable). would not have been possible to hold a dslr up without giving away what he was going to do. and 8x10 enlargement with good enough detail was possible.\n\nequipment lifespan. still am able to use the same film slr as i was in 2010 when i first got into film.\n\nnegatives will always be view able, i suspect long before raw digital file formats of today become hard to open. i treat a negative as i would a digital raw file. it was my love for film that meant all my digital work is shot in raw, no questions asked, though for me to tweak the process. it has also made me careful even with a dslr and i will seldom fill a card unless i am doing 4k video.\n\n# film disadvantages for me\n\npointless for action photography when you try and take many. reloading film during action will cause you to miss the action, 36 exposures (35mm) is not enough for an action session. a memory card can hold way more than that the high isos with high shutter speeds needed if in lower light will result in far lower quality on film unless you have good lighting, as film above iso 400 - 800 can be very grainy and can look very nice if developed properly with a look you want, but unless your using medium format or large format will fall apart if you try and make big enlargements of such a film. the loss of provia 400x was a blow here when it was discontinued. i am glad kodak bought back tmax 3200 however, for this was very good in poor light for 12x16 enlargements and may have me revisit film for this purpose.\n\nlow light performance of digital in terms of raw quality will outstrip film, and will probably run rings around it if you do not wish to use a flash. trying to shoot an iso 3200 film with the lens stopped all the way open and trying to focus a gathering with a very narrow depth of field is like walking on a tightrope, though is perfectly doable, and i have done it. a decent dslr could give you better quality and an extra stop or two of speed if you require it.\n\ndust, dust, dust. trying to get dust off a negative while printing it. a single tiny hair you did not see while preparing the print? time to make a new one. i use a condenser enlarger, further compounding this problem. this is probably for me the biggest gripe. digital is less stressful in this regard. and sometimes, my sanity can be tested. i now run an air purifier and ensure darkrooms are kept as clean as possible, but still... trying to remove dust from your negative is a nighmare straight from the depths of hell. black-and-white films (apart from c41 ones) cannot make use of digital ice due to the silver content when scanning, though you can correct for this in photoshop.\n\nnegatives are fragile. you must care for them and handle them with care if you want to make more gelatin silver prints. digital media is far more robust. use digital for backup high-resolution scans, always. i keep all mine filed, and have often had to go back to certain negatives more than once when people want more prints for someone else.\n\ndigital is a one-time purchase for equipment and software bar paper and consumables or lab printing, and if you are not to worry about printing most of your work, is probably the way to go unless you enjoy film workflow for other reasons. my nikon dslr has given flawless service bar needing a new battery. film has on-going costs, but these are not too bad if you process at home and scan at home.\n\nscanning in good quality is time consuming if you have many photos. digital can have a more streamlined workflow, if you need to do a high quantity of good quality pictures, as you need not prepare every print once you have calibrated your print.\n\nsharing with the world, need i say more? the very act of sharing photos here is a hybrid solution even if film is used.\n\nnot as small as the smallest digital cameras if size really does matter, though a lightweight disposable can be good, but unless you want it for the candid value, your smartphone would probably do better if you have a flagship model or reasonable model.\n\nhp instant ink and other

After I took the plunge to buy my own printer, I wanted to track my printing as closely as possible to offer some information back to the photography community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest problem with tracking the cost of ink for a printer, in my opinion, come from three different sources.\n\nThese are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Variable ink coverage\n2. Untraceable ink waste lost to printer maintenance\n3. Inconsistent tracking\n\nWith these issues in mind, I set out to attempt to track my costs as accurately as possible over a year of ownership, starting the day I opened the box. I built myself a spreadsheet to track every single print and maintenance event that occurred over the year.\n\n  \n\n1. To counter the problem of variable ink coverage, I made sure to print a wide variety of images and extended my testing period. My thought is that the more I print, the less the variability between prints will affect my results. At this point, I can print multiple 13x19s and when I record the ink usage, there is no effect on the cost per square inch. The Pixma Pro-100 has the ability to adjust the print quality. I kept it set at \u201cHigh\u201d (instead of \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cFine\u201d) for almost all prints. The only time it was changed to \u201cfine\u201d was to test to see if I could spot a difference. (Conclusion: I couldn\u2019t.)\n2.  To control for ink used in maintenance, I recorded the date of each print, and tried to go no longer than 10 days between prints. I cannot stop the printer from doing maintenance cycles, but I can control how often they happen. Because they are a regular part of owning a printer, I am happy to include this cost as part of the total cost per square inch.\n3. Inconsistent tracking is often due to printing non-images. A common practice is to print test-pages rather than full images as part of printer head maintenance cycles, but I believe this could skew ink usage. I made sure to print images, even if they are just 8.5x11, as part of my weekly printing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Methodology**\n\nFor every print, I recorded the print number, date, image size, image filename, paper, and print quality. I avoided printing nozzle tests or other such test prints, and almost exclusively printed photos. This was to ensure that my printing represented accurate photo printing costs. After each print session, I recorded the level of each colour remaining in the tank. While the reported ink status is only to the nearest 10% (and shown only in graphical form, thanks Canon), under-reporting by 10% on all 8 colours results in only a 3.06% change in the final cost per square inch. Under-reporting just 1 colour by 10% results in a change of 0.36% in the final cost per square inch. This does add a level of uncertainty to this work, but with the sample size here I don\u2019t think it causes a major issue.\n\nWhen I needed to replace an ink tank, I updated the ink level to 100% and added 1 to the count of empty ink tanks, which gave me a total number of ink cartridges used.\n\nFor each print, the image size was multiplied to give a square inch size. These were then summed to give a total number of inches printed. At the same time a separate sheet totaled the number of empty cartridges and added the amount of ink missing from each colour still in the printer. This gave me a total amount of ink used.\n\nTo come up with a total cost of the ink used, the price at the time of purchase of each colour was recorded. To make sure that sale prices didn\u2019t unduly affect the total average cost, the price is not averaged per colour, but rather per cartridge.\n\nThe total cost of ink used is then calculated by multiplying the average cost per cartridge by the cartridges used. Finally the total cost of the ink used is divided by the total square inches printed.\n\nIn the same way, I also tracked the paper I purchased and used a similar system for calculating the total expenditure for each paper type/size.\n\nI won\u2019t get into paper costs too much, as it\u2019s fairly straight forward to figure out ahead of time how much it costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\nOver the course of 1 year of ownership:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  Number of images printed: 301\n2. Total square inches printed: 27007.75\n3. Total ink cartridges consumed: 26.0\n4. Average cost of ink cartridge: $21.41\n5. Total ink expense: $560.64\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInk Costs\n\nIn the end, the total cost per square inch landed at $0.02076.\n\nAt this rate, here are some costs examples of standard print sizes:\n\n* 4x6 - $0.50\n* 5x7 - $0.73\n* 8x10 - $1.66\n* 8.5x11 - $1.94\n* 11x14 - $3.20\n* 11x17 - $3.88\n* 12x18 - $ 4.48\n* 13x19 - $5.13\n\nPaper costs:\n\nI ended up using MOAB\u2019s 300gsm Exhibition Luster for most of my prints. I loved the look of it and the price point. It was also readily available at both of my local camera stores, which made it easy to not have to carry a large stock of paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    &lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"

put a finger print on my paper and then the ink didn\u2019t stick, leaving a ghost finger print in the middle of my image. Solution: bought cotton gloves to handle the paper before and after printing.\n* One print, number 252, splattered yellow ink across the print. Solution: ran the nozzle cleaning then nozzle check cycles. Haven\u2019t had a problem since.\n* A variety of prints that were printed with incorrect settings. Problem existed between chair and keyboard.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI love the print quality that this printer produces. By far the weakest link is my own capability as a photographer and not the printer. I\u2019m also extremely happy with the cost of ownership of this printer. There have been 0 breakdowns over the course of the year, and it continues to print great print after great print. If you are a hobbyist, or even getting started as a professional, this is the printer for you. I hope this helps give a better picture of how much it costs to operate these types of printers!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/avuk1z/printing_your_own_photos_cost_analysis/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "printing your own photos - cost analysis /!/ when i was looking into printing my own work about a year ago, i found it difficult to find information on the cost effectiveness of buying my own printer. after i took the plunge to buy my own printer, i wanted to track my printing as closely as possible to offer some information back to the photography community.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe biggest problem with tracking the cost of ink for a printer, in my opinion, come from three different sources.\n\nthese are:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n1. variable ink coverage\n2. untraceable ink waste lost to printer maintenance\n3. inconsistent tracking\n\nwith these issues in mind, i set out to attempt to track my costs as accurately as possible over a year of ownership, starting the day i opened the box. i built myself a spreadsheet to track every single print and maintenance event that occurred over the year.\n\n  \n\n1. to counter the problem of variable ink coverage, i made sure to print a wide variety of images and extended my testing period. my thought is that the more i print, the less the variability between prints will affect my results. at this point, i can print multiple 13x19s and when i record the ink usage, there is no effect on the cost per square inch. the pixma pro-100 has the ability to adjust the print quality. i kept it set at \u201chigh\u201d (instead of \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d) for almost all prints. the only time it was changed to \u201cfine\u201d was to test to see if i could -----> spot !!!  a difference. (conclusion: i couldn\u2019t.)\n2.  to control for ink used in maintenance, i recorded the date of each print, and tried to go no longer than 10 days between prints. i cannot stop the printer from doing maintenance cycles, but i can control how often they happen. because they are a regular part of owning a printer, i am happy to include this cost as part of the total cost per square inch.\n3. inconsistent tracking is often due to printing non-images. a common practice is to print test-pages rather than full images as part of printer head maintenance cycles, but i believe this could skew ink usage. i made sure to print images, even if they are just 8.5x11, as part of my weekly printing. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**methodology**\n\nfor every print, i recorded the print number, date, image size, image filename, paper, and print quality. i avoided printing nozzle tests or other such test prints, and almost exclusively printed photos. this was to ensure that my printing represented accurate photo printing costs. after each print session, i recorded the level of each colour remaining in the tank. while the reported ink status is only to the nearest 10% (and shown only in graphical form, thanks canon), under-reporting by 10% on all 8 colours results in only a 3.06% change in the final cost per square inch. under-reporting just 1 colour by 10% results in a change of 0.36% in the final cost per square inch. this does add a level of uncertainty to this work, but with the sample size here i don\u2019t think it causes a major issue.\n\nwhen i needed to replace an ink tank, i updated the ink level to 100% and added 1 to the count of empty ink tanks, which gave me a total number of ink cartridges used.\n\nfor each print, the image size was multiplied to give a square inch size. these were then summed to give a total number of inches printed. at the same time a separate sheet totaled the number of empty cartridges and added the amount of ink missing from each colour still in the printer. this gave me a total amount of ink used.\n\nto come up with a total cost of the ink used, the price at the time of purchase of each colour was recorded. to make sure that sale prices didn\u2019t unduly affect the total average cost, the price is not averaged per colour, but rather per cartridge.\n\nthe total cost of ink used is then calculated by multiplying the average cost per cartridge by the cartridges used. finally the total cost of the ink used is divided by the total square inches printed.\n\nin the same way, i also tracked the paper i purchased and used a similar system for calculating the total expenditure for each paper type/size.\n\ni won\u2019t get into paper costs too much, as it\u2019s fairly straight forward to figure out ahead of time how much it costs.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**results**\n\nover the course of 1 year of ownership:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n1.  number of images printed: 301\n2. total square inches printed: 27007.75\n3. total ink cartridges consumed: 26.0\n4. average cost of ink cartridge: $21.41\n5. total ink expense: $560.64\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nink costs\n\nin the end, the total cost per square inch landed at $0.02076.\n\nat this rate, here are some costs examples of standard print sizes:\n\n* 4x6 - $0.50\n* 5x7 - $0.73\n* 8x10 - $1.66\n* 8.5x11 - $1.94\n* 11x14 - $3.20\n* 11x17 - $3.88\n* 12x18 - $ 4.48\n* 13x19 - $5.13\n\npaper costs:\n\ni ended up using moab\u2019s 300gsm exhibition luster for most of my prints. i loved the look of it and the price point. it was also readily available at both of my local camera stores, which made it easy to not have to carry a large stock of paper.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n    &lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"&gt;\n

printing.\n* one print, number 252, splattered yellow ink across the print. solution: ran the nozzle cleaning then nozzle check cycles. haven\u2019t had a problem since.\n* a variety of prints that were printed with incorrect settings. problem existed between chair and keyboard.\n\n**conclusion**\n\ni love the print quality that this printer produces. by far the weakest link is my own capability as a photographer and not the printer. i\u2019m also extremely happy with the cost of ownership of this printer. there have been 0 breakdowns over the course of the year, and it continues to print great print after great print. if you are a hobbyist, or even getting started as a professional, this is the printer for you. i hope this helps give a better picture of how much it costs to operate

I did not want to add one more \u201churray I got a full frame thread\u201d.\n\nBut after a few months of using and comparing DX/FX, I hope this could serve for a few D7000 holdouts who are still validating and hopefully help a few who are considering a switch to full frame. To give a bit of background, I have been holding on to D7000, my first DSLR. And looking back, one of the reasons I bought the D7000 was a sagely advise I got on the internet \u201cBuy your second camera first\u201d. There could not have been a better advise. After many years of good service upgrading the D7000 was a challenge. The obvious upgrade candidates were D7200 or D7500 and by way of improvement, they were not compelling enough for me to upgrade.\nThe big draw of D7200 is the extra pixels and competent AF system, whereas D7500 was a mixed bag. It is a mini D500 with some of the high ISO images are astounding. However, barring the sensor and tilt screen, it is not what I was looking for. I could have overlooked the single card slot, but removal of AI index tab was pretty much unacceptable for me. So, I decided to buy a full frame. \nD610 was ruled out since I wanted better autofocus and D750 seemed like a perfect fit. But the question remained on the associated cost of full frame lenses. For a while I contemplated, but what swung the decision was, I had been shooting pretty much with primes (35 1.8 /50 1.8 /85 1.4 ) out of which the 50 rarely comes out of the bag and the 35 was almost welded . So, it felt natural an upgrade would just mean the body and mostly one walk around lens. I was just hoping I could get a deal during holidays on D750 and waited patiently.\nOut of no-where I stumbled upon an ebay listing for used D810 and the rabbit hole took me to used D800s whose prices have dropped unbelievably low. The D800 meant I did not have to bother about lens as the DX crop would pretty much give me a D7000 image. I took the plunge on a mint D800 and with hardly a few thousand-shutter count, I am more than pleased with my upgrade. Now that I have been shooting with D800, I want to share some observations of someone who upgraded from DX to FX.\n\nHandling:\nWorse than D7000. The grip is not great. I hand held it without strap for a few days and I did not like the heavy and unbalanced body compared to by D7000 which in my opinion was better balanced for my pinky. I bought a holster and it feels a bit better now. The power button and Dpad are smoother, but the shutter sound is not crisp.\nControls:\nI do not like the ISO button placement, but Auto ISO on single flick is great. The metering buttons on D7000 was far better than the controls which are unusable on D800. I just assigned Fn2 for Matrix and leave it on Spot. However, I do not understand how anyone can shoot with this gimped button placement. If anyone knows how one can change ISO or metering modes while looking through the view finder, I will appreciate.\nI preferred the primary knobs of D7000 for its simplicity but not much to complain as I usually shoot Manual mode/single. Fortunately the AF selector works the same. So does exposure compensation. Overall, it\u2019s a Nikon you expect it to be.\nAutofocus:\nComing from D7K, which has more mood swings than your pregnant wife, the AF is predictable. However, I can see the left AF issue is pretty strong to a point I cannot use 3D AF. I think the bad rap that Nikon got for D600 was deserved. After acknowledging the Left AF issue, Nikon never issued a service advisory for D800. Does it impact my shooting? Yes, I am forced to be conscious which I prefer not to be. But it is better than D7K.\nFirst impressions:\nIt is not faster or slower than D7000, I rarely go to CL/CH with D7K, but I think 4fps is not fast at any stretch so not worth switching. I was expecting to be blown away by the view finder, but it was just marginally better.\nWhen I realized it did not have an IR trigger, I could not believe it. At only $400 Nikon was offering a laughable solution. I plan to shoot tethered rather. (Connecting to digicam control and a powerpoint remote seems good to go).\nBattery life is worse. With the D7000; I never had to worry about charging my battery. But D800 is comparably half the endurance.\n\nIf you read this far, you would have assumed, I am mostly neutral or indifferent to the camera. But I wanted them to get out of the way before I say how much I like the D800.\nLens Image Quality:\nWhen I took the decision to upgrade, my primary reason was; an upgrade to full frame will also improve upon my lenses. So essentially it will be a body + lens upgrade. But I was not prepared to see the quality of files that I managed to get.\nSimply put, as I shot mostly portraits, I was able to get the shots I liked with way less effort I used to put on D7K. And this was not an exaggeration. The neglected 50mm suddenly became a thing of beauty. The 35DX was surprisingly sharp and crisp with acceptable vignetting (which I prefer for portraits). But the true revelation was the 85 1.4. It is the ultimate combination with full frame for portraits.\n\nDynamic Range:\nComing from D7000 it is not a day and night difference, but I can clearly see D800 holding up incredibly well for pushes in post processing. I have pretty much switched over to darktable/Gimp with D800 and I manage to get a lot better colors compared to D7000. \n\nColor, Sharpness and Tonality:\nI sometimes shoot jpeg small at 9MP and the images are sharp and crisp compared to my D7K raws. I am not very keen on sharpness usually, but I am impressed at D800 raw. It is not just the sharpness, but the beautiful roll over of tonality is a delight. I never saw any follies on my D7K until I compared it with D800. Now I know why some full frame users scoff at DX.\nBut what pleases me the most is the color. I no longer have to fight the jaundice that plagues skin tones from D7000. This is particularly true for images that are slightly out of focus where D7K used to demonstrate weird color shifts. This is the single most important advantage I relish with the upgrade.\n\nSo do I recommend an upgrade to full frame for anyone shooting DX ?\nI know this might sound a bit clich\u00e9 but if you have to ask, you should not upgrade. Sometime about a couple of years ago, I took a photo in low light which I was both proud of and knew I would have gotten better if I had a full frame. I thought about it a long time and decided to watch over what I shoot. I limited my shutter count to ensure I get the shot right as much as possible. I knew I had come to the edge of what my camera can do and I made the decision to upgrade.\n\nI remember moving from point and shoot to DSLR and was underwhelmed at my inability to get the best out of D7K. It took a lot of practice and I did not want to repeat the same mistake. But at the current prices, a used D6xx or D800 are absolute no brainers. It costs lesser than a D7500 or even D7200 (though new vs used). Have a go and give yourself a treat. What if you prefer to buy only new? I suggest just wait.

(connecting to digicam control and a powerpoint remote seems good to go).\nbattery life is worse. with the d7000; i never had to worry about charging my battery. but d800 is comparably half the endurance.\n\nif you read this far, you would have assumed, i am mostly neutral or indifferent to the camera. but i wanted them to get out of the way before i say how much i like the d800.\nlens image quality:\nwhen i took the decision to upgrade, my primary reason was; an upgrade to full frame will also improve upon my lenses. so essentially it will be a body + lens upgrade. but i was not prepared to see the quality of files that i managed to get.\nsimply put, as i shot mostly portraits, i was able to get the shots i liked with way less effort i used to put on d7k. and this was not an exaggeration. the neglected 50mm suddenly became a thing of beauty. the 35dx was surprisingly sharp and crisp with acceptable vignetting (which i prefer for portraits). but the true revelation was the 85 1.4. it is the ultimate combination with full frame for portraits.\n\ndynamic range:\ncoming from d7000 it is not a day and night difference, but i can clearly see d800 holding up incredibly well for pushes in post processing. i have pretty much switched over to darktable/gimp with d800 and i manage to get a lot better colors compared to d7000. \n\ncolor, sharpness and tonality:\ni sometimes shoot jpeg small at 9mp and the images are sharp and crisp compared to my d7k raws. i am not very keen on sharpness usually, but i am impressed at d800 raw. it is not just the sharpness, but the beautiful roll over of tonality is a delight. i never saw any follies on my d7k until i compared it with d800. now i know why some full frame users scoff at dx.\nbut what pleases me the most is the color. i no longer have to fight the jaundice that plagues skin tones from d7000. this is particularly true for images that are slightly out of focus where d7k used to demonstrate weird color shifts. this is the single most important advantage i relish with the upgrade.\n\nso do i recommend an upgrade to full frame for anyone shooting dx ?\ni know this might sound a bit clich\u00e9 but if you have to ask, you should not upgrade. sometime about a couple of years ago, i took a photo in low light which i was both proud of and knew i would have gotten better if i had a full frame. i thought about it a long time and decided to watch over what i shoot. i limited my shutter count to ensure i get the shot right as much as possible. i knew i had come to the edge of what my camera can do and i made the decision to upgrade.\n\ni remember moving from point and shoot to dslr and was underwhelmed at my inability to get the best out of d7k. it took a lot of practice and i did not want to repeat the same mistake. but at the current prices, a used d6xx or d800 are absolute no brainers. it costs lesser than a d7500 or even d7200 (though new vs used). have a go and give yourself a treat. what if you prefer to buy only new? i suggest just wait. the age of sub $1000 full frame cameras are already here and it will only get better in the short term before bouncing away. unless you are at the edge of what you can get out of dx, you may not appreciate much of what fx gives. it might sound a bit hypocritical. but remember it is only a small percentage of images you will see the difference between fx vs dx.\n\n\n", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 82055, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 334353, "autor": "hurricjayne", "date": 1546364730000, "content": "Dot/Smudge on photo? /!/ I noticed a small spot on my photos and nothing I do seems to help.

I sold all of my film gear and switched over to the FD mount system just because of this lens. After a bit of research and it being at a $200 USD price point, I determined that this lens would be sharpest, fastest, longest, and at the lowest cost with the detriment of not having autofocus. This lens is sharp enough to provide plenty of feather texture on birds, and to be comfortable cropping in quite a bit as wildlife photographers often need to do. There are even sharper MF lenses, and of course modern zooms will out preform this lens, but you really can't beat it at the price point.\n\nBut that being said, there is a learning curve to using a manual focus lens for wildlife. Mirrorless cameras help a lot with this, as they have multiple focus aides that help you ensure your focus is spot on. The biggest help is focus peaking, where overlayed on your image is a red or white or blue coloring showing what areas are in focus. Another focus aid is a zoom feature that shows you a small detailed area so you can ensure you are in focus. I also use a diagonal crosshairs overlay so as to aid in finding my subject by shooting with both eyes open. \n\n[Here is an album of images from the Sony a6000](http://imgur.com/a/xHbjoRU)\n\n[Here is an album of images from the Olympus OM-D EM-5](http://imgur.com/a/pDtwV5s)\n\nThe Sony a6000 is my main camera for wildlife and is what I have the most experience with. I rented the Olympus OM-D EM-5 so that I could try out the in body image stabilization as a solution for shooting in low light. I had it for two weeks. \n\nThis is really not a fair comparison, but it is what I rented so this is what we got. I would very much like to compare the a6500 and the OM-D EM-1 mkII, but I digress.\n\nThe focus peaking itself is visually similar between cameras, operationally the Sony's is always on. On the Olympus, the feature must be mapped to a button to be functional and you must toggle it on yourself. The Olympus also has a feature that brightens the screen when the focus peaking is on which serves as both an indicator and improves visibility, especially in sunny conditions. \n\nThe zoom-to-check-focus feature works similarly as well, by hitting a button a small square shows up, hitting it again zooms in further. For two-eye-open shooting, I found that the 7x zoom rectangle on the EM-5 to be perfect for simulating the FoV of my 400mm lens. \n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/a/aLcqDgM) is how I set up each camera for aperture priority, adjusting ISO through the Fn menu on the Sony. The a6000 gives more freedom to adjust each and every button, the EM-5 has more adjustable settings but with more restrictions on the mappable functions, in particular regards to the dial functions. I could not, for example, put both the Exp Comp on the rear dial and ISO selection on the front. The locations of the mappable buttons are much better in my opinion on the EM-5, being on top and not requiring extra hand movement. \n\nBoth cameras are quite small for holding such a large lens, but a sturdy adapter holds it up well. The a6000 has a better grip however. The video button on the EM-5 is in a much better location. \n\nStabilization is of course where the Olympus shines. I really dislike using a tripod and was having issues getting enough light to shoot on cloudy mornings. I did not have much time to test the absolute limits of the stabilization, but I was comfortable hand holding 1/125 s at 800mm equivalent, which I think could have gone even further. This is just as good as my camera being on a tripod, and was, in my opinion more reliable. I could also use faster glass more often due to the increased crop factor ie my 200 2.8 vs the 400 4.5. \n\nStabilization made the videos that I took much much smoother and usable compared to the micro jitters that occur handheld on the a6000. \n\nThe stabilization has its downfalls, mainly only being able to access the settings for it through the big menu, where you have to change the focal length setting each time you change lenses, as well as having to have the right stabilization directions enabled ie if shooting birds in flight, full stabilization is inappropriate and you must srt accordingly. Shooting from an idling car really messed with the stabilization as well. \n\nThe viewfinder on the Olympus was by and far the better of the two. It was bigger, brighter, and clearer. Using focus peaking on the Olympus however, did kill the frame rate, however with such a high resolution it sometimes was not needed.

When it comes time to buy a new camera, this is going to be one of the big deciding factors. \n\nAll that being said, both cameras make excellent images, and the camera and lens is going to matter a lot less than technique in regards to wildlife photography.

 on. the biggest help is focus peaking, where overlayed on your image is a red or white or blue coloring showing what areas are in focus. another focus aid is a zoom feature that shows you a small detailed area so you can ensure you are in focus. i also use a diagonal crosshairs overlay so as to aid in finding my subject by shooting with both eyes open. \n\n[here is an album of images from the sony a6000](http://imgur.com/a/xhbjoru)\n\n[here is an album of images from the olympus om-d em-5](http://imgur.com/a/pdtwv5s)\n\nthe sony a6000 is my main camera for wildlife and is what i have the most experience with. i rented the olympus om-d em-5 so that i could try out the in body image stabilization as a solution for shooting in low light. i had it for two weeks. \n\nthis is really not a fair comparison, but it is what i rented so this is what we got. i would very much like to compare the a6500 and the om-d em-1 mkii, but i digress.\n\nthe focus peaking itself is visually similar between cameras, operationally the sony's is always on. on the olympus, the feature must be mapped to a button to be functional and you must toggle it on yourself. the olympus also has a feature that brightens the screen when the focus peaking is on which serves as both an indicator and improves visibility, especially in sunny conditions. \n\nthe zoom-to-check-focus feature works similarly as well, by hitting a button a small square shows up, hitting it again zooms in further. for two-eye-open shooting, i found that the 7x zoom rectangle on the em-5 to be perfect for simulating the fov of my 400mm lens. \n\n[here](http://imgur.com/a/alcqdgm) is how i set up each camera for aperture priority, adjusting iso through the fn menu on the sony. the a6000 gives more freedom to adjust each and every button, the em-5 has more adjustable settings but with more restrictions on the mappable functions, in particular regards to the dial functions. i could not, for example, put both the exp comp on the rear dial and iso selection on the front. the locations of the mappable buttons are much better in my opinion on the em-5, being on top and not requiring extra hand movement. \n\nboth cameras are quite small for holding such a large lens, but a sturdy adapter holds it up well. the a6000 has a better grip however. the video button on the em-5 is in a much better location. \n\nstabilization is of course where the olympus shines. i really dislike using a tripod and was having issues getting enough light to shoot on cloudy mornings. i did not have much time to test the absolute limits of the stabilization, but i was comfortable hand holding 1/125 s at 800mm equivalent, which i think could have gone even further. this is just as good as my camera being on a tripod, and was, in my opinion more reliable. i could also use faster glass more often due to the increased crop factor ie my 200 2.8 vs the 400 4.5. \n\nstabilization made the videos that i took much much smoother and usable compared to the micro jitters that occur handheld on the a6000. \n\nthe stabilization has its downfalls, mainly only being able to access the settings for it through the big menu, where you have to change the focal length setting each time you change lenses, as well as having to have the right stabilization directions enabled ie if shooting birds in flight, full stabilization is inappropriate and you must srt accordingly. shooting from an idling car really messed with the stabilization as well. \n\nthe viewfinder on the olympus was by and far the better of the two. it was bigger, brighter, and clearer. using focus peaking on the olympus however, did kill the frame rate, however with such a high resolution it sometimes was not needed. this made finding my subject much easier despite decreased field of view due to the crop factor.  when it comes time to buy a new camera, this is going to be one of the big deciding factors. \n\nall that being said, both cameras make excellent images, and the camera and lens is going to matter a lot less than technique in regards to wildlife photography. if you have any questions about wildlife photography, manual focus lenses, or canon fd mount, or either of these cameras, i will try my best to answer them.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 82397, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 334756, "autor": "luisluna0327", "date": 1547151364000, "content": "California will always be the spot", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/aemys9/california_will_always_be_the_spot/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "california will always be the -----> spot !!!

A place that, unbeknownst to me, would eat hours of my time and much of my money. The first photograms we made hooked me, seeing the actual artistry that happens just in putting the image onto paper, not just what you captured with your camera.\n\n\nOver weeks I\u2019d learn a ton about composition, development, and printing just from my professor, and I grew to love how film looked. I hate grain, with every fiber of my being. I have to urge myself not to throw noise reduction to 100 on every photo I take at an ISO above 400.

I shoot mostly street photography but once in a while i shoot girls too. So invited this girl to a session. Most girls like my photos so they accept it pretty easily. I told her only a small percentage of the photos are usually usable and that i don't send anything unedited ever. She insisted that she wanted unedited photos but i shut her down everytime. She insisted a lot but i never accepted her requests. We still did the session. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe brought her boyfriend with her. Quite guy, didn't say much. She was liking all the photos, but in the middle of the session she started being really inquisitory, hitting me with a bunch of questions about me, the girls i shot before, why some of them didn't follow me, why i didn't have more photos, why i had one photo in my profile and then deleted it. Just a bunch of random questions about things that frankly are non of her business. I was still polite with her though she made me lose a lot of time answering all of her personal questions. We still shot a few more pictures and she was happy with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, there was never any sort of formal agreement between us about anything. I told her the photos would be for me and for her to use on our profiles, but never told her exactly how many or when i would send. She was very persistent though, always asking for the photos, always asking for unedited photos. I showed her prints of some unedited photos for her to tell me which ones she liked, and i did tell her i would send it to her when i was done editing them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important to say that we had a very relaxed way to talk to each other, that wasn't professional at all, but more \"friendly\", and we did fight a little bit over certain issues regarding the photos, but nothing major. There were a lot of misunderstandings in our communication.  But we got along fine most of times when discussing the photos. I do joke around a lot, but nothing objectively inappropriate, nothing sexual. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, she is a bit arrogant in the way she talks and is extremely demanding. Repeats the same thing over and over and over again, asks for the same thing a lot, even when i say no, and if i say no, she accuses me of not being a man of my word. Doesn't seem to understand the concept of collaboration. I'm not working for her, i'm not interested in all the photos she is interested in, so at this point i'm just editing photos to please her, since i only wanted a handful of photos and i already published them. Also, when i published one photos we had a big fight because she started being really bitchy about it, telling me i didn't ask for permission. I told i did asked her before the session if i could use the photos and she said sure. But now she is telling me \"oh, you didn't ask if you could use that one, and i don't have yet the photos that i want\". She was being bitchy more because she didn't have everything she wanted, and the new rule, created on the spot by her, was that i could only publish her photos after sending her everything she wanted. Stuff that was never agreed before between us. I asked her around 50 times if i could have the photo on my profile. She didn't answer and kept talking about how she didn't have the photos she asked for. Then finally said ok as long as i sent her the photos she wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn person she started talking about how she was afraid her photos would end up in some questionable pages, because she had to be very careful about these things since her parents are in court against each other over the divorce or whatever(she is 18). I really didn't understand her whole point but something about her started to appear a bit off to me at that point. Honestly, she striked me as an overly protected brat not willing to take a no. She is very, very, very pretty and seems to come from a rigid family. She also told me about she and her friend being invited for a session by a photographer, but then finding out he had the hidden agenda of taking more erotic photos, so they didn't accept it and went to the police. She talks a lot about courts and about going to the police and this strikes me as trouble. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago she came ask me again if X and X and X photos were ready, and i told her NO. Then i asked her if she wanted to publish them in her IG stories. At this point she already has 20 pictures, i only used 4, but hasn't posted any of them. She really seems obsessed with the pictures though. I suspect that she blocked me from seeing her IG stories and has been publishing the photos. I'm not 100% on that, but i commented with her that i was under the impression that she used to have a few story highlights on her page, and now they're gone. Also, she used to post stories everyday but i haven't seen a new story for almost a week. She replied \"Yeah, i deleted a few things and i'm thinking in deleting my ig account and creating a new one, but that's none of her business\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, given that i've been trying to be nice and give her what she wants, i didn't really like that sort of answer. And she talking about deleting accounts also makes me suspicious. Kinda seems like she is testing some sort of cop out. My only concern is she using images in a way that i don't approve of or without giving me credit for it, and something tells me that's what she was about to attempt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, at this point i just had it with her and told her: \"I think our communication ends here. Have a nive life\". She replied \"wtf\". I mean, i just don't wanna have to deal with her. I don't like her, she doesn't seem to like me and i don't wanna be giving her any more freebies. And i think that's ok. Sometimes people don't get along. And if i get a long with you, i might do something for you. If i don't, i don't have to give you a big portion of my time. I wanted to send you the photos before, but now i don't want to anyome. At this point what i wanted was a \"fine, bye\" and everything ending up ok. I go my way, she goes hers, and it's the end. She's still left with 20 pics that she loves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day i receive a message from her boyfriend, asking me to leave her alone and saying that i was inappropriate and a pig and if i didn't leave her alone and sent her the pictures he would press charges against me, and that i'm not a man of my word, and that i fooled her and promised her things i didn't deliver, etc, etc. None of this is true btw. But trying to explain it to him is like talking to a wall. He said what he wanted to say and simply didn't say much more other than \"i've said what i had to say\" and \"goodbye\". Also, talked a lot about karma. So i can't really explain anything to this person. I can't have a conversation with him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later i added them both in the same chat and sent them the unedited photos because she seems really unbalanced and i just wanted to get it over it. It wouldn't surprise me she had a mental breakdown over pictures and really tried to screw me in some way. Even if it was through lies. He replied \"thanks for keeping your promises\". I said: \"I'm not keeping my promises because i've never promised her i would send her everything she wanted, when she wanted. In fact, i said the contrary.

 by her, was that i could only publish her photos after sending her everything she wanted. stuff that was never agreed before between us. i asked her around 50 times if i could have the photo on my profile. she didn't answer and kept talking about how she didn't have the photos she asked for. then finally said ok as long as i sent her the photos she wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin person she started talking about how she was afraid her photos would end up in some questionable pages, because she had to be very careful about these things since her parents are in court against each other over the divorce or whatever(she is 18). i really didn't understand her whole point but something about her started to appear a bit off to me at that point. honestly, she striked me as an overly protected brat not willing to take a no. she is very, very, very pretty and seems to come from a rigid family. she also told me about she and her friend being invited for a session by a photographer, but then finding out he had the hidden agenda of taking more erotic photos, so they didn't accept it and went to the police. she talks a lot about courts and about going to the police and this strikes me as trouble. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\na few days ago she came ask me again if x and x and x photos were ready, and i told her no. then i asked her if she wanted to publish them in her ig stories. at this point she already has 20 pictures, i only used 4, but hasn't posted any of them. she really seems obsessed with the pictures though. i suspect that she blocked me from seeing her ig stories and has been publishing the photos. i'm not 100% on that, but i commented with her that i was under the impression that she used to have a few story highlights on her page, and now they're gone. also, she used to post stories everyday but i haven't seen a new story for almost a week. she replied \"yeah, i deleted a few things and i'm thinking in deleting my ig account and creating a new one, but that's none of her business\". \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nnow, given that i've been trying to be nice and give her what she wants, i didn't really like that sort of answer. and she talking about deleting accounts also makes me suspicious. kinda seems like she is testing some sort of cop out. my only concern is she using images in a way that i don't approve of or without giving me credit for it, and something tells me that's what she was about to attempt. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nso, at this point i just had it with her and told her: \"i think our communication ends here. have a nive life\". she replied \"wtf\". i mean, i just don't wanna have to deal with her. i don't like her, she doesn't seem to like me and i don't wanna be giving her any more freebies. and i think that's ok. sometimes people don't get along. and if i get a long with you, i might do something for you. if i don't, i don't have to give you a big portion of my time. i wanted to send you the photos before, but now i don't want to anyome. at this point what i wanted was a \"fine, bye\" and everything ending up ok. i go my way, she goes hers, and it's the end. she's still left with 20 pics that she loves. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nnext day i receive a message from her boyfriend, asking me to leave her alone and saying that i was inappropriate and a pig and if i didn't leave her alone and sent her the pictures he would press charges against me, and that i'm not a man of my word, and that i fooled her and promised her things i didn't deliver, etc, etc. none of this is true btw. but trying to explain it to him is like talking to a wall. he said what he wanted to say and simply didn't say much more other than \"i've said what i had to say\" and \"goodbye\". also, talked a lot about karma. so i can't really explain anything to this person. i can't have a conversation with him. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\na few hours later i added them both in the same chat and sent them the unedited photos because she seems really unbalanced and i just wanted to get it over it. it wouldn't surprise me she had a mental breakdown over pictures and really tried to screw me in some way. even if it was through lies. he replied \"thanks for keeping your promises\". i said: \"i'm not keeping my promises because i've never promised her i would send her everything she wanted, when she wanted. in fact, i said the contrary. you two are just too immature and dishonest to recognize it. i'm only sending this because i want her off my ass once and for all\". \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhe didn't really reply, she blocked me right away. maybe even reported me. i don't know. and i'm willing to bet all those photos are going to be used without me receiving any credit for it. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nwould you have approached this situation differently?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 85168, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 337421, "autor": "man_of_many_cactii", "date": 1557360744000, "content": "Time to upgrade?

It was an Olympus E-400, and I thought it was a bargain. I was drawn to this camera initially because of the letter E which I thought of as *Equality,* but you might think of *Excellent* and that would be a good guess. The 400 also piqued my interest because it is of course a square number, very prevalent in the photograph theory involving squares.

What's the catch, I thought? \n\nAnd then I forgot all about this demon man with vacuum breath of fire for eyes.

Then they became more obvious and more ominous. Ever since that fateful day, which had started much like any other, I have been cursed with haunted pics, no matter what I do most of the time. It's Hell. \n\nThe effects of the Poltergeist are varied. Lots of the pictures I take of people just look like ghostly apparitions - like normal people but floating about looking blurred, as if the ghost is manipulating reality towards the shadow realm, or maybe even the photons themselves are being warped by the presence of a spectre in the lens.\n\nSome photos are just blackness and at least 2 have just been pictures of the ground. That could be my fault though. One one trip, the Poltergeist even moved the CF card from the camera into my card reader and I didn't realise until I got home and I didn't have the photographs of any of the women I saw. That ghostly taunting message popping up on the screen made so much more sense now. \n\nThe next day, I put the CF card in, and it still came up with the same taunting message about the battery being low. I did the hack where you take the power block out and recharge it and it fixed it for a while but I have to do it pretty much all the time after any late night session with spiders in my house. But enough about me.\n\nThe final straw when I knew my ghost had taken things too far was when it photoshopped pictures of my amazing best friend and my girlfriend having sex. I can tell you, I certainly gave that ghost a piece of my mind for treating my best friend like an animal in that way and my girlfriend too. I remember my girlfriend sort of looked really sad at the time, in so many different ways. Probably because understood the pain I go through.\n\nBut enough about me, I don't want me to come across as arrogant or some sort of drama queen, but I came to find out based on multiple possibilities and my own experience that the mysterious camera guy was the Devil, and he had most likely given me a cursed camera for some sort of malevolent purpose, or maybe just a hellish prank?\n\nHe's not asked me to take that photo for him yet, but I'm not worried because I don't think he will.
