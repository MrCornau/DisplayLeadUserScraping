Chips and cookies are not food.\n\n\\------\n\nThis is my first Reddit post and English is my second language. Proofreaders are appreciated, but no grammar police, please. Also if this is not fitted for the group, please delete.\n\nI\u2019m a photography student trying to build a portfolio, so I volunteered to shoot some pictures at a film festival event this Saturday. I usually shoot street, portraits and student events and had never taken events with 500+ people, so I was excited about the opportunity. Anyway, I learned to not work at events for free again.\n\nThe event started at 6pm (6pm door, 7pm the screening), but somehow on the day of, at noon, the organizer texted me and told me to show up at 4:45pm. I questioned her why I need to show up 75 minutes before the event since the door won\u2019t be open until 6pm anyway. She told me that I only needed to show up at 4:45pm because she would be there since 3pm to set up. I then asked her what's to shoot if the guests won't be there this early. She decided not to text me back. So I got to the venue at 4:30 (I always arrive 15 min early for a gig).\n\nWhen I got to the venue, obviously the guests are not there yet... People were setting up. I asked the organizer if there would be food. If not, I'd go to the burger place a block away (I don't mind getting my own food, but at least give me a meal break if your event is 6-10) and eat something before 6. She said there's food and I can't go anywhere because the volunteer orientation would happen soon. The volunteer orientation ended up not happening because the other photographer was late. So I was there shooting pictures of the volunteers (that's why she asked me to come and 75 minutes earlier). Also, later, I found out that what she meant by food was a few bags of snack-size Doritos chips and some Chips Ahoy cookies.\n\nSo I acted professionally and shot the red carpet, the preshow, the award ceremony after the screening and the after-party. Some board member of the festival just treated me like an employee and asked me to take pictures of them while I was taking a group picture of 100+ people. Shooting a 100+ people picture was hard enough in low light setting, and having cell phone cameras getting in my way. Getting pulled away while trying to do that was worse.\n\nLater, they asked me to be in a picture with all the volunteers. The organizer asked me to hand my camera to a guest with a nice Sony A-series camera. I refused because I didn't believe a guy with a fancy Sony camera could operate my cheap Nikon in low light settings with an off-camera flash without at least a 2 minutes tutorial, nor did I want to hand my camera to an absolute stranger who was already holding a camera. He would be able to take better picture with his camera than a borrowed one. The organizer was confused/mad about why I didn't give the guest my camera. \n\nI told the organizer a few days before the event that I would need to leave by 11pm because transit sucks in my city. Of course, things never go as planned, the after-party was supposed to start at 9:30pm and ended up starting at 10:45pm. They needed me to shoot \"some pictures\" at the after-party and I stayed around 11:30pm. Right before I left, the organizer told me that they would need a few pictures sent to them that night for their media coverage the next day. Screw the hungry photographer, right? I said I would downsize them to 1500px and send them over and no... They said it was too low and wanted all the photos as \"high resolution\" -- whatever that means to them, I don't know.\n\nSo I got home at 1am, still hadn't eaten, picked out my top 10 and uploaded to my cloud. Then I got an email asking me to upload everything to their cloud instead...\n\nIt's been a few days and I'm still editing the 150 photos (out of the 400 I took). So... Ya. Never again. I deserve more than chips and cookies for 7 hours of work and 4 nights of post. They better pay me for my work next time. Lesson learned.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nAlso, one question... I'd like to learn how do I organize a picture with 100+ people? I don't want to sound rude, but cell phone cameras were getting in my way.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nPS, there's also a second photographer. She was told to come at 4:45pm, but she got there at 5:30pm. She came with a borrowed camera so she had no idea how to use it. She bumped into her friend at the event and she YOLO'd and left during the middle of the screening with her friends, leaving only me at the after-party.

i said i would downsize them to 1500px and send them over and no... they said it was too low and wanted all the photos as \"high resolution\" -- whatever that means to them, i don't know.\n\nso i got home at 1am, still hadn't eaten, picked out my top 10 and uploaded to my cloud. then i got an email asking me to upload everything to their cloud instead...\n\nit's been a few days and i'm still editing the 150 photos (out of the 400 i took). so... ya. never again. i deserve more than chips and cookies for 7 hours of work and 4 nights of post. they better pay me for my work next time. lesson learned.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nalso, one question... i'd like to learn how do i organize a picture with 100+ people? i don't want to sound rude, but cell phone cameras were getting in my way.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nps, there's also a second photographer. she was told to come at 4:45pm, but she got there at 5:30pm. she came with a borrowed camera so she had no idea how to use it. she bumped into her friend at the event and she yolo'd and left during the middle of the screening with her friends, leaving only me at the after-party. i guess this is the photographer they deserve.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 77528, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 333693, "autor": "Alameda-", "date": 1551303395000, "content": "People who switched, I need your help /!/ So about 6 months ago I purchased a Canon T7i/800D + 18-55mm kit lens + 50mm 1.8.
