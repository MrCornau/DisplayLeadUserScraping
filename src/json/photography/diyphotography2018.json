I moved up from a 500D about 6 months ago and I feel that the 5DII is exactly where I am as a hobby photographer.\n\nIt was cheap enough for me to buy that I don't have to think about depreciation, I don't mind the size or weight (those arguments never made any sense to me) even after days in the outdoors with it. I have a Sigma Art 20, 50 and Canon 70-200L f4, which fit my needs.\n\nThere is only one thing. I do mostly landscape and this time a year, that means a lot of snow. In general, I feel that I would like to improve the weather sealing. Now, in heavy rain I just use a ziploc-bag and cover the camera. That works, if a bit cumbersome.\n\nWhat I would like to do is to maybe fill the gap between the battery grip and the housing with silicone and anything else that possible to do to better the sealing.\n\nI have no issues with reduced value for the camera or anything like that.

/!/ Personally, it has to be products. It may be the most straight forward starting point for alot of people, since your subject never move, and you could always shift and play with your light in whatever way you want, but god is it hard to achieve a specific look you want. I feel like there's so much more variables, because every product, has a vastly different shape. Its not like say, humans, while we might have different size or height, we'll still look pretty similar physically, and photographing a round object vs a square object isn't the same.   \n\n\nThen you got all your different lighting set ups. You got flags, reflector boards, foamcore boards, diffusion panels, and so many more equipment that helps you shape light on the subject. You move your light slightly? Its gonna look totally different in camera. There's so many variables at play here that I have a real hard time learning. Then you got all the different non photography related tools, strings, clips, dust blowers, steamer and the list goes on for helping with product photography. Mirrors or Acrylic boards give you reflection if you place it on the bottom, which is a really cool look.   \n\n\nThen there's the photoshopping and manipulation, there's alot more you gotta take note of to show a perfect example, dust, scratch marks, fingerprints on glass, unwanted reflections, I feel that its alot easier and more prominent for people to pixelpeep at those compared to say portraits or human subjects.   \n\n\nI remembered back then, working as an assistant, my boss and I were just sitting on little stools trying tens of different ways to shape the light to whatever he wants. A single product can take a long ass time to finish before we move to the next one. And adding to that, he was using a Phase One for products, and we always end up with huge ass 700mb files afterwards, and with photoshopping, upwards of 1GB. You could see all the dust spots that would otherwise be too small for full frame sensors.  \n\n\nThat said, I have alot of respect for people who specialise doing product photography. Its cool, but I personally don't enjoy it as much as others, but its the best way to learn about lighting and light modifiers. The good thing is that if you're not very social, you won't have to worry, since your products are dead. You can start off with 1 light, take a few photos with the lights shifted, and composite them into 1 final image, and if you do it well, nobody will be able to know you did with one light. Plus, in most cases, you don't always have to look 100% professional, you could be using more DIY items to help the product shoot, and if you're lucky like my boss, the clients just give the products, and we just have to finish shooting and editing them by a certain date, so there isn't as much pressure.
