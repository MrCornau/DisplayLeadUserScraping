I learned a lot about what makes good sports photography as well as how to effectively document the \u201csummer camp life\u201d. Hopefully some of the info in this post can help people who are interested in doing something like this or just are interested in sports photography in general.\n\nTo start things off this is not my first time shooting sports. I have a lots of experience working as a photographer for my college newspaper where I documented pretty much all the sports teams over four years. So coming into working this camp I was definitely in my element. Secondly I know the sport of Ultimate Frisbee very well. I have been playing the sport for over a decade (I will touch on the importance of this later in the post) and have a good knowledge of how the flow of the game goes.\n\n[Some of my best shots](https://imgur.com/a/pcL8C10)\n\n**My Gear:**\n\nCanon 6D / Canon 5D mk II\n\nTamron 24-70 f/2.8\n\nTamron 150-600 f/5-6.3 G2\n\nYongnuo 85 1.8\n\nUSA Gear Double Camera Harness\n\nDell Inspiron i7, 16gb RAM, 250gb SSD laptop\n\nKingston Multi Card Reader USB 3.0\n\nNew Balance running shoes\n\nMy gear was pretty standard for long form documentation of any sporting event. One body with a wide to medium telephoto (5d mk2 + 24-70) and another body with a super telephoto to capture the downfield action (6D + 150-600). I used a double camera harness off amazon and in retrospect it\u2019s pretty bad. I should have dropped the money to get the Black Rapid harness because the one I used was slightly uncomfortable and needed to be readjusted on a regular basis. While it was bad, it got the job done so I can\u2019t really complain. My laptop is no beast but I could process all my photos with little to no slowdown. Also get a pair of running shoes with good support because standing all day with heavy equipment can wreck your feet.\n\n**How to Capture Sports 101:**\n\nThe most important part of shooting sports is understanding the game. With my experience with Ultimate Frisbee, I knew how the game flowed so I could accurately predict what kind of plays were about to happen. This helped with my positioning around the field as well. I would camp out in the corner of the endzones and alternate from having the disc moving away from to the disc moving towards me. Each approach helped me achieve certain types of photos. The long \u201chail-mary\u201d type plays were easier to capture when the disc was moving towards me while the defensive plays were much easier to catch when the disc was moving away. As a \u201cone man band\u201d I couldn\u2019t possibly capture every exciting moment but putting myself in the right spots and reading the game helped me capture things at a higher percentage.\n\nWhen it came to focal length, shooting at the farthest was the most ideal. With the Tamron 150-600 I stayed around 400-300 because it would be tight enough to be close to the action but also wide enough where I could crop tighter if need be. Most of the time I shoot on shutter priority at 1/1000th with Auto ISO. This guaranteed that I could freeze any motion and seeing as though it was very bright out my ISO never moved past 800. The exception was that once a week the camp had a night game where I moved down to 1/800 so I could get a little more light and ease up on the ISO. Burst mode and AI Servo mode for AF were a necessity for this kind of shooting. Back button autofocus also made it much easier to pre-focus on an area and then track subjects when needed. For the more detailed and close up shots I would have my 24-70 at my hip mostly locked at 24mm. This was important because if two kids were having a laugh or the counselors were giving advice to a camper I could quickly pull up my wide angle and snap a few shots before the moment went away. I would mostly keep this at 2.8 and a relatively high shutter speed. Some famous photographer said that if your photos suck you probably aren\u2019t close enough. This is possibly the one thing I would want people to get out of this post. With my wide angle shots I was mostly down on the ground and very close to my subject and this raised the level of my photos tremendously. Also with the long telephoto the closer I could get physically to the action, the less compression I got and that would lead to less flat photos. Don\u2019t be afraid to get down and dirty to get a shot, by the end of the day my clothes were covered in dirt and grass just from being on the ground so much. With that being said, prepare for the work that you will be doing later. I would delete any photo that I thought would not be a keeper. Missed, focus, boring moment, generally uninteresting were all reasons for me to delete a photo. Instead of having to go through hundreds of photos at the end of the night, I would have a few dozen of photos that I knew were good enough. I did a lot of \u201cchimping\u201d while out at the fields so I could save time in processing later.\n\nMy philosophy for what photos to keep was basically \u201cdid it encapsulate the atmosphere of the camp?\u201d Sometimes the best plays or highlights don\u2019t show what the camp is actually like. I would take a lot of photos of just the kids laughing or all around being happy. Focus on the fun moments and also the exciting moments for a good balance. Get to know the campers as well because then it makes them feel more comfortable around you. Find the personal moments because those are the ones that really show what the camp atmosphere is all about. One aspect of the photography that I tried to focus on was keep the photos aesthetically simple. The background is just as important as the foreground. Even an out of focus cluttered background will make a good shot look bad. Search out clean and simple backgrounds for your photos because it makes the subject standout.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\nSince it was my job to not just document the action on the field but to capture off field activities as well, I was working pretty much all day with little time for breaks. The most important piece of advice from me in this regard would be to shoot JPEG. Not only did it save me a lot of time importing and processing, I could focus on getting the exposure correct in camera so I wouldn\u2019t need to spend lots of time correcting lazy mistakes after the fact. Also Canon JPEG have enough latitude that most exposure imperfections could be fixed with a few adjustments of the slider. Whenever I was not obligated to be somewhere taking photos I would be ingesting all my photos onto my laptop to be processed. If I had time I would process the photos and the importance of getting the exposure right in camera was that all I really had to do was crop most of the keepers. Learning Lightroom\u2019s shortcuts will make your processing so much faster. Cropping, tagging, and copying/pasting settings becomes so much faster when all you have to do is press a key combo.\n\n**Final Thoughts:\n**\nThis was probably the most fun I have ever had working a job. They say if you like what you do that you\u2019ll never work a day in your life. While the hours were long and the constant work stressed me out, I had a smile on my face the whole time. I recommend everyone try to get involved with some kind of summer camp or after school activity because seeing the kids so happy to see your photos was something I\u2019ll remember for a long time. At the end of the day it\u2019s all about showing what the camp is about and enjoying and experiencing it firsthand will only let you do your job better.

I would mostly keep this at 2.8 and a relatively high shutter speed. Some famous photographer said that if your photos suck you probably aren\u2019t close enough. This is possibly the one thing I would want people to get out of this post. With my wide angle shots I was mostly down on the ground and very close to my subject and this raised the level of my photos tremendously. Also with the long telephoto the closer I could get physically to the action, the less compression I got and that would lead to less flat photos. Don\u2019t be afraid to get down and dirty to get a shot, by the end of the day my clothes were covered in dirt and grass just from being on the ground so much. With that being said, prepare for the work that you will be doing later. I would delete any photo that I thought would not be a keeper. Missed, focus, boring moment, generally uninteresting were all reasons for me to delete a photo. Instead of having to go through hundreds of photos at the end of the night, I would have a few dozen of photos that I knew were good enough. I did a lot of \u201cchimping\u201d while out at the fields so I could save time in processing later.\n\nMy philosophy for what photos to keep was basically \u201cdid it encapsulate the atmosphere of the camp?\u201d Sometimes the best plays or highlights don\u2019t show what the camp is actually like. I would take a lot of photos of just the kids laughing or all around being happy. Focus on the fun moments and also the exciting moments for a good balance. Get to know the campers as well because then it makes them feel more comfortable around you. Find the personal moments because those are the ones that really show what the camp atmosphere is all about. One aspect of the photography that I tried to focus on was keep the photos aesthetically simple. The background is just as important as the foreground. Even an out of focus cluttered background will make a good shot look bad. Search out clean and simple backgrounds for your photos because it makes the subject standout.\n\nWorkflow:\n\nSince it was my job to not just document the action on the field but to capture off field activities as well, I was working pretty much all day with little time for breaks. The most important piece of advice from me in this regard would be to shoot JPEG. Not only did it save me a lot of time importing and processing, I could focus on getting the exposure correct in camera so I wouldn\u2019t need to spend lots of time correcting lazy mistakes after the fact. Also Canon JPEG have enough latitude that most exposure imperfections could be fixed with a few adjustments of the slider. Whenever I was not obligated to be somewhere taking photos I would be ingesting all my photos onto my laptop to be processed. If I had time I would process the photos and the importance of getting the exposure right in camera was that all I really had to do was crop most of the keepers. Learning Lightroom\u2019s shortcuts will make your processing so much faster. Cropping, tagging, and copying/pasting settings becomes so much faster when all you have to do is press a key combo.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis was probably the most fun I have ever had working a job. They say if you like what you do that you\u2019ll never work a day in your life. While the hours were long and the constant work stressed me out, I had a smile on my face the whole time. I recommend everyone try to get involved with some kind of summer camp or after school activity because seeing the kids so happy to see your photos was something I\u2019ll remember for a long time. At the end of the day it\u2019s all about showing what the camp is about and enjoying and experiencing it firsthand will only let you do your job better.

sports photography in general.\n\nto start things off this is not my first time shooting sports. i have a lots of experience working as a photographer for my college newspaper where i documented pretty much all the sports teams over four years. so coming into working this camp i was definitely in my element. secondly i know the sport of ultimate frisbee very well. i have been playing the sport for over a decade (i will touch on the importance of this later in the post) and have a good knowledge of how the flow of the game goes.\n\n[some of my best

medium telephoto (5d mk2 + 24-70) and another body with a super telephoto to capture the downfield action (6d + 150-600). i used a double camera harness off amazon and in retrospect it\u2019s pretty bad. i should have dropped the money to get the black rapid harness because the one i used was slightly uncomfortable and needed to be readjusted on a regular basis. while it was bad, it got the job done so i can\u2019t really complain. my laptop is no beast but i could process all my photos with little to no slowdown. also get a pair of running shoes with good support because standing all day with heavy equipment can wreck your feet.\n\nhow to capture sports 101:\n\nthe most important part of shooting sports is understanding the game. with my experience with ultimate frisbee, i knew how the game flowed so i could accurately predict what kind of plays were about to happen. this helped with my positioning around the field as well. i would camp out in the corner of the endzones and alternate from having the disc moving away from to the disc moving towards me. each approach helped me achieve certain types of photos. the long \u201chail-mary\u201d type plays were easier to capture when the disc was moving towards me while the defensive plays were much easier to catch when the disc was moving away. as a \u201cone man band\u201d i couldn\u2019t possibly capture every exciting moment but putting myself in the right spots and reading the game helped me capture things at a higher percentage.\n\nwhen it came to focal length, shooting at the farthest was the most ideal. with the tamron 150-600 i stayed around 400-300 because it would be tight enough to be close to the action but also wide enough where i could crop tighter if need be. most of the time i shoot on shutter priority at 1/1000th with auto iso. this guaranteed that i could freeze any motion and seeing as though it was very bright out my iso never moved past 800. the exception was that once a week the camp had a night game where i moved down to 1/800 so i could get a little more light and ease up on the iso. burst mode and ai servo mode for af were a necessity for this kind of shooting. back button autofocus also made it much easier to pre-focus on an area and then track subjects when needed. for the more detailed and close up shots i would have my 24-70 at my hip mostly locked at 24mm. this was
