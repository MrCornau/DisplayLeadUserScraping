Specifically, looking to start with either a 2 x D2 or 2 x Siros S kit and shortly after add a single B1X or Siros L  for the odd location shoot I do (which seldom, if ever, utilize more than one light)- rest of the time it'll be a 'regular' third light in the studio. \n\nNow I've done a fair bit of research over the past days into familiarizing myself with the various options these manufacturers offer- it can be quite overwhelming at first!-, and have arrived at the aforementioned lights for my needs. I'm a fashion-portrait photographer who is a slow shooter- I take my time to compose and don't blast a million frames a minute. I'd say I average no more than 10 frames a minute. I thought about a pack/head setup for a minute as the size/weight of the heads makes things a touch more manageable, but a) the price is much higher and b) things like faster recycle rates are lost on me. \n\nOn Friday I'll be going into a couple shops which stock both brands and will try both kits out first hand (I've never had my hands on either). I spent a good 30 minutes chatting with a couple sales reps today, both of whom told me that Profoto of recent years have had a much higher failure rate than ever before (one of them quoted up to 30-40% fail rate; I was shocked! And he was a Profoto rep/user of 30 years) and that the brand overall was heading in a different direction (something about targeting social media- can't remember).  Of course this forewarning scared me somewhat, but I'm still open to Profoto. Truth be told, their interface seems more intuitive to me. Same rep also mentioned that the Bron Siros is probably due for an update sometime soon, though he mentioned that knowing Bron, it'll likely mostly be a facelift. \n\nBig part of why I'm looking at Bron is that I've read they've got superior colour consistency, plus I intend to get a Para 133 or 177 along with the lights- a longtime dream modifier. Now I'm aware this can be used with other flash heads, but I don't see a point in that as the Broncolor kit is actually priced pretty much exactly the same (if not a bit less) than the Profoto kit- this surprised me as I was expecting the Bron to be substantially pricier for some reason... maybe the Para cost just made me awesome it was all more expensive across the entire range. \n\nAnyways, I'm eager to get some hands-on time this Friday, but in the meantime am wondering if anyone could comment on their findings involving the above two brands- and specifically, the models I've referenced above.

How do I change this? /!/ I started photography about 6 months back and bought a Mirrorless camera about 4 months back. Initially started with street and landscape and after doing it for 3 or a bit more months I started doing portraits for a number of reasons. I feel I like it much more (the story may be a post in itself and not really relevant to the discussion) and would like to get really good in this field (I know it must take a lot of time). I must say that I have a day job so photography isn't something I depend on for money and that is why I think I have full freedom to explore this area without caring about the monetary side of things.\n\nSo far I am just taking pics of pretty girls. And without sounding cheesy, cliched or a pervert I would say that my idea is to capture female beauty since it really fascinates me. Some photographers that inspire me are Dubnistkiy, Ana Dias, Haris Nukem. \n\nAfter shooting portraits for about 2 months (all outdoor shoots in my city) I feel like every shoot of mine is now getting repetitive. Repetitive in the sense that I end up having less and less variety in my pics with each shoot. I especially realized this in the last shoot when I was just standing not sure of what to do. Moreover, I feel that I am unable to come up with something unique and my pics end up looking like so many others on Instagram. I have posted my pics on other subreddits (with a different account) here and some have got a lot of appreciation so I don't think I am necessarily taking bad pics. \n\nBut I feel that I am not able to come up with something unique or develop a style. Constrained by my sorroundings I am also not able to do lots of things that I would like to do. For example, I live in a big city so my themes so far have been all urban in nature. There are some parks here but parks seem artificial and I would like shooting in more natural locations say a farm, near the sea or something else. When I travel I would do those things but at the moment what I am unable to fix is a lack of creativity.\n\nI don't want to just be a guy with a camera who is taking pics of pretty girls since so many are doing that. I would really like to be good at this and develop a style and inspire others since I feel I have the resources and time and money to fully follow my passion. But I am not sure what to do next. Right now my photography gear consists of a Mirrorless camera and a prime lens 85mm F1.8 (and 2 kit lenses which I don't use now).\n\nSo what should I do next?\n\n1. Buy more gear? Like lighting equipment etc? \n2. Try to come up with new ideas? If yes then how? Travelling to new locations? Looking at the works of more photographers? Or something else.\n3.

A couple of days later the best friends mom (BFM) texts me &amp; says she would like to set up a shoot for BFF senior pics same day since we were planning to do group shots of them together anyway.\n\nOriginally, I tried to get them to stagger the shoots so that I could focus on each of the boys individually and then overlap the start/end times so they would be together to do a few group shots and then I could move on to the next shoot. Well OM &amp; BFM decide it would be easier for them to just schedule both at the same time and just switch off - not ideal but I\u2019ll make it work. \n\nWe do the shoots, I show them pictures throughout and everyone says it\u2019s looking great. OM was very specific during the shoot about different shots and locations she wanted and I complied with almost every request she had. Since, we combined the shoots it caused us to start at a high sun time because they wanted some shots at the end at sunset so I had to time it accordingly. \n\nOne of the locations we did is a mural on a big building. I explained that since it was 4pm, there would be some harsh shadowing because the sun shines directly onto this mural. Everyone seemed to understand at the time.\n\nI deliver the pictures and OM says direct quote \u201cI love the pictures! Just went through them all and you did an amazing job.\u201d All is good so I thought until yesterday when OM texts me with a laundry list of issues. First, she asked me if all the pictures I sent her were edited. They all were (about 80 photos all together). Then proceeds to say she showed them to all of her friends and family and that they thought a majority of the pictures were \u201creally bad.\u201d She then goes onto say there\u2019s lots of \u201clighting\u201d issues (there\u2019s not but I\u2019ll get onto that) and that the angles are \u201cawkward\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d\n\nI told her I stand behind my decisions I made as a photographer and editor, but that if she could send me specific file names I\u2019d be happy to re-edit them for her. She says she doesn\u2019t want any re-edited. So I ask her would she like a partial refund - No, she doesn\u2019t want that either. So I ask her what would satisfy her and she says she just wants me to hear her concerns. Okay, fine. Then she sends me another text saying how only 6 out of the 80 photos are usable and that her son doesn\u2019t want me to post any of them. She feels she\u2019s \u201cfailed as a mom\u201d because the pictures are bad. As if that\u2019s not enough, she then texts saying she\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d that I didn\u2019t offer to reshoot without her having to ask me. I told her that with all the concerns and issues she stated she had  with the pictures I did not think she would want  me to reshoot. No response since then.\n\nIn my opinion a lot of the \u201cawkward\u201d angles and such aren\u2019t due to me, it was due to her son being a little uncomfortable in front of the camera. I tried to provide direction on poses during the shoot but the son shot down most of my suggestions and did his own thing. A lot of his poses were awkward (held tilted back, looking down at ground, etc). \n\nAs for the lighting issue, obviously there is shadowing - it was a 90 degree day with high sun and the mural location is really the only one out of the 4 we did that was in direct sunlight. But the shadows aren\u2019t horrible and her biggest complaint was that some parts of the mural weren\u2019t in the background and she doesn\u2019t understand why I took shots \u201cabove the waist and not full length\u201d aka closeups and headshots. \n\nI\u2019m just not really sure what to do &amp; I\u2019ve showed the pictures to a few of my family and colleagues who I know will be honest and no one saw any issue with the pictures other than saying some of the poses were weird. \n\nI will say BFFs pictures turned out a bit better, but I strongly feel that\u2019s because he had better poses and was really a natural in front of the camera, but I did the same editing styles on both sets and BFM said she loved all the pictures as well (I\u2019m hoping none arise and I plan to check in with her and make sure).\n\nAlso, should add when I sent out the sets I always include the offer to re-edit anything because I know not everyone likes the same styles but again everyone \u201cloved\u201d the pictures.\n\nSince she said she didn\u2019t want anything I\u2019m not really sure how to make this right or even what the point of her saying all this to me was. I\u2019ve honestly never had a client come back &amp; say anything like this before. This shoot was $200 and included wallet sets and other prints so I really don\u2019t stand to make much or lose much either way. \n\nThere was no contract as she\u2019s a family friend and I assumed there would be no issues (rookie mistake I know.)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/d85p3t/client_loved_pictures_at_first_but_now_has_a/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "locations", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "client \u201cloved\u201d pictures at first, but now has a laundry list of issues. /!/ hello, first time poster here &amp; just want to rant/get advice about a situation that recently happened.\n\nso, for background i have been doing photography about 9 years now. i started in high school and have worked in several organizations/companies shooting pictures and do photography at least weekly at my current job including events/headshots. \n\nonto current dilemma. \n\ni did a senior shoot a couple weeks ago and the original mom (om) said her son wanted to take a couple of pictures with his best friend (bff). i said that would be fine. a couple of days later the best friends mom (bfm) texts me &amp; says she would like to set up a shoot for bff senior pics same day since we were planning to do group shots of them together anyway.\n\noriginally, i tried to get them to stagger the shoots so that i could focus on each of the boys individually and then overlap the start/end times so they would be together to do a few group shots and then i could move on to the next shoot. well om &amp; bfm decide it would be easier for them to just schedule both at the same time and just switch off - not ideal but i\u2019ll make it work. \n\nwe do the shoots, i show them pictures throughout and everyone says it\u2019s looking great. om was very specific during the shoot about different shots and -----> locations !!!

As for delivery, do clients generally prefer digital delivery or something physical like a USB drive? What do you personally use?\n4. Along with my contract, I was thinking of creating a \"How the Process Works\" page on my website to explain each phase of the process so that clients always know what to expect and aren't confused.

My plan was to hit up Mt Shasta, Lassen Volcanic NP, and Lake Tahoe.

Thanks to my research I was able to get some great shots of Mt Shasta, The Milky Way, and Lake Tahoe.\n\n-Went at the right time. I had planned my trip for when schools and colleges had restarted and the weather was hopefully still good. This worked out perfectly, the weather was awesome and the crowds were few. Especially at Lassen Volcanic NP.\n\n-Brought the right gear. I had bought a USB charger for my camera batteries and had the good sense to get an extension cable and a car charger to charge my batteries in the car when I went from location to location as I was sleeping in a tent for a few nights and I would have limited access to electrical outlets.\n\n-Got the right bag. I spend a lot of time finding a camera bag that would fit my needs and I eventually got the Lowe Pro Flipside Trek 350. Having room for two water bottles and a place for a first aid kit and food was great for hiking up and down mountains. Not to mention, the feature that allows you to twist the bag around to the front and not have to put your camera bag down all the time was really useful.

I missed the fact that a couple of the places I was going to charged parking fees and I didn't have enough cash on me for them. So I had to go elsewhere.\n\n-Got the smaller bag. After hiking all day and cramming my bag full of stuff, I wish I would have went with the 450 model over the 350. I still had room for all my camera gear, but the extra space would have been great for hiking gear.\n\n-Planned too many locations. In the future I'm going to stick to one place at a time for the most part and really explore while keeping my eye out for good compositions. Having three different locations in four days was too much for my first trip.\n\nConclusion: \n\nOverall I will grade my first photography trip as a B+.

Years ago I was diagnosed with an astigmatism and given a prescription for glasses to be worn as-needed, which I never did back then- at least I don't think. A few years ago my vision started deteriorating and upon inspection, turns out the astigmatism got worse and I required a stronger prescription. Additionally, I have an undiagnosed problem where my vision seems to fluctuate at times... sometimes it'll be crystal clear, able to see small details in the distance with no problem, but it only lasts like 20-30 min before reverting to my crappy de facto vision... it really does upset me a lot as my vision is everything to me- more than just my livelihood, I have always been a hugely visual person and not seeing everything perfectly really kills me. Sometimes even the glasses aren't enough :( \n\nAnyways... for years I relied almost exclusively on AF... manual was just too much of a drag and focus was always an issue, even before the glasses. But I noticed even with AF on my big DSLR's (like the Nikon D800) the focus was never 100% to my liking, so I started using live view to manual focus and have enjoyed the results a great deal more. So on digital, no problemo... but for film photography, which I'm getting back into in a big way, manual focus is a major issue for me. All of my film cameras are manual focus. I only recently acquired them and haven't spent too much time on them yet, but what time I have spent proved to be problematic due to the focusing. Is there any way for someone with poor eyesight who wears glasses (and, ideally, has specifically an astigmatism) to attain tack-sharp critical focus on manual focus film cameras? I'm dealing with a Hasselblad 503cw, Leica M-A, Mamiya 7II, Pentax 67II. Years ago I used to shoot large format and the ability to check focus with a loupe against the ground glass was very helpful... I can't really do that with these systems unfortunately... Maybe I \\*could\\* take off the viewfinders and go up against the glass like I did on the large format, but it's a much smaller area. Do loupes come in different magnifications? Also I worry this will be too time-consuming and that I'll miss many moments/shots as a result. I shoot a combination of studio and location, both with studio lights or natural light. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I'm really keen to attain perfect critical focus in my photos of my subjects. Also, I should add that I wear glasses, which always fog up and get oily when pressing my face against the camera and it's annoying. Not sure how I'd do with contacts as I hate getting things in my eye more than most. \n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/c2plxt/manual_focus_analog_camera_with_astigmatismglasses/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "manual focus analog camera with astigmatism/glasses? /!/ i am a full-time fashion/portrait photographer, shooting for about ten years now. years ago i was diagnosed with an astigmatism and given a prescription for glasses to be worn as-needed, which i never did back then- at least i don't think. a few years ago my vision started deteriorating and upon inspection, turns out the astigmatism got worse and i required a stronger prescription. additionally, i have an undiagnosed problem where my vision seems to fluctuate at times... sometimes it'll be crystal clear, able to see small details in the distance with no problem, but it only lasts like 20-30 min before reverting to my crappy de facto vision... it really does upset me a lot as my vision is everything to me- more than just my livelihood, i have always been a hugely visual person and not seeing everything perfectly really kills me. sometimes even the glasses aren't enough :( \n\nanyways... for years i relied almost exclusively on af... manual was just too much of a drag and focus was always an issue, even before the glasses. but i noticed even with af on my big dslr's (like the nikon d800) the focus was never 100% to my liking, so i started using live view to manual focus and have enjoyed the results a great deal more. so on digital, no problemo... but for film photography, which i'm getting back into in a big way, manual focus is a major issue for me. all of my film cameras are manual focus. i only recently acquired them and haven't spent too much time on them yet, but what time i have spent proved to be problematic due to the focusing. is there any way for someone with poor eyesight who wears glasses (and, ideally, has specifically an astigmatism) to attain tack-sharp critical focus on manual focus film cameras? i'm dealing with a hasselblad 503cw, leica m-a, mamiya 7ii, pentax 67ii. years ago i used to shoot large format and the ability to check focus with a loupe against the ground glass was very helpful... i can't really do that with these systems unfortunately... maybe i \\*could\\* take off the viewfinders and go up against the glass like i did on the large format, but it's a much smaller area. do loupes come in different magnifications? also i worry this will be too time-consuming and that i'll miss many moments/shots as a result. i shoot a combination of studio and -----> location !!! , both with studio lights or natural light. any advice would be greatly appreciated as i'm really keen to attain perfect critical focus in my photos of my subjects. also, i should add that i wear glasses, which always fog up and get oily when pressing my face against the camera and it's annoying. not sure how i'd do with contacts as i hate getting things in my eye more than most. \n\nthanks in advance!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 68974, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 321995, "autor": "Snooopay", "date": 1558487553000, "content": "Good Starter Camera for Photography? /!/ I'm looking for a good starter camera mainly for photography, I live in the mountains and love capturing Nature, and because I live in a tourist location also people.

With Milky Way season (roughly Mar - Oct) upon us in the Northern Hemisphere, I thought I'd write a quick guide for you guys with some fun pictures along the way! As some of you may know I am a landscape photographer from the PNW. I also guide photo tours and have spent a lot of time shooting the Milky Way. Hopefully this guide will help at least one person get started with Milky Way photography this year!\n\nIf you want - You can see a better formatted version of this guide on my [website](https://www.rosssvhphoto.com/Milky-Way-Guide)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[The night sky over Mt Rainier with wildflowers, Washington](https://imgur.com/dTKggxM)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**Topics Covered**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n######**Camera Equipment**\n\n-Minimum Required Equipment\n\n-Preferred Equipment\n\n######**Preparation and Planning**\n\n-Moon, Dark Skies, Alignment and Weather\n\n######**Focusing Your Lens**\n\n-During Night or Day\n\n######**Camera Settings**\n\n-Manual Mode, ISO, Aperture, Shutter Speed and The 500 Rule\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[The Milky Way arches over Crater Lake, Oregon](https://imgur.com/sKjg7kO)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n##**Camera Equipment**\n\n\nPhotographers love to talk about equipment, but it\u2019s honestly one of my least favorite topics. While it is important to know your gear, you will improve your photography much faster by going out and taking shots or viewing other photographers work, rather than researching/buying every piece of gear on the market.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**- Minimum Required Equipment**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Tripod**\n\n-You need a tripod (well built and sturdy). Invest now and it will last for years. A cheap tripod will be unsteady, leading to blurry images. I can\u2019t stress enough how important a good tripod is!\n\n###**Camera with manual mode**\n\n-Manual mode means you can manually adjust the ISO, aperture and shutter speed.\n\n###**Camera lens with a minimum f/4 aperture**\n\n-The smaller the f-stop (f/4, f/2.8, etc,) the more light your lens can let it. The more light, the more star detail you can capture.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**- Preferred Equipment**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Tripod**\n\n-A tall, strong tripod with an excellent ball head.\n\n###**Full-frame camera**\n\n-While today's crop sensor (and even some point and shoot cameras) can shoot stars, full-frame ISO performance will perform better.\n\n###**14-24mm wide angle lenses with minimum f/2.8 aperture**\n\n-My favorite lens for milky way photography is a 24mm f/1.4.\n\n###**Shutter release/Intervalometer**\n\n-Allows for long than 30s exposure times and reduces camera vibrations when pressing the shutter.\n\n###**Star tracker**\n\n-A star tracker is a device that attaches to your tripod. You then mount your camera on the device and it follows (tracks) the stars as they move through the sky, allowing for longer exposure times (greater star detail). Learn more about exposure times in the camera settings section.\n\n-This item is definitely not necessary, but it will greatly improve the quality of your star shots. To keep things simple, we won\u2019t be going over star trackers in this guide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Milky Way above Mt St Helens, Washington](https://imgur.com/6J1unSv)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**Preparation and Planning**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPreparation and planning are two of the most important aspects of Milky Way photography. Knowing the moon phase, how much light pollution to expect, where the Milky Way arm will align and what the weather will be like are some of the biggest factors to a successful outing. You should also try and scout your destination during the daytime. Finding locations and compositions is extremely difficult in the dark.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^*I ^am ^not ^paid ^by ^or ^affiliated ^with ^any ^of ^the ^brands ^listed ^below.\n\n\n###**Moon Phase**\n\n-The moon is very bright, brighter than you probably remember. A full moon will keep most stars from being visible.\n\n-When shooting the Milky Way, you usually want to shoot between one week before and one week after a new moon for best results. The closer you are to the new moon, the better.\n\n-TOOL: You can find moon phases easily online, but I find using either The Photographer's Ephemeris or the Photo Pills app is extremely useful.\n\n\n\n###**Light Pollution/Dark Skies**\n\n-Humans give off a lot of light, especially in big cities. The closer you are to a city, the more this light pollution will affect your image, reducing the number of stars in your shot.\n\n-TOOL: Using a site like darksitefinder.com makes it incredibly easy to see how much light pollution is in your area. The darker the area (blacker), the better it is for Milky Way shots.\n\n\n\n###**Milky Way Alignment**\n\n-Stars move through our sky as the Earth rotates. The Milky Way arm is no different. You will want to know where the Milky Way arm will be when you\u2019re shooting.\n\n-The most common time to shoot the Milky Way in the northern hemisphere is March through October.\n\n-TOOL: Using an app like Stellarium makes locating the Milky Way arm easy. I recommend that you set the Milky Way brightness to 8+ in the advanced settings.\n\n\n\n###**Weather**\n\n-Weather might be the biggest factor in Milky Way photography. If it is too cloudy, you won\u2019t be able to see the stars. Knowing if clear or cloudy skies are forecasted can help you plan ahead.\n\n-TOOL: You can find weather data almost anywhere, but a few of my favorites are cleardarksky.com, weather.gov or Google weather.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[The night sky above Mt Hood on a perfectly calm night - Oregon\n](https://imgur.com/1gTGoi2)\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**Focusing Your Lens**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOk, you have all the basic gear you need, you\u2019ve done all your planning and preparations, and now it\u2019s time to get out there and shoot! Right? Well...almost!\n\nWithout a property focused lens, it is impossible to achieve any success at Milky Way photography. Because of this, you will need to know how to focus your lens before you go out shooting. Because stars are very far away, one would think you could simply adjust your focus ring to infinity (or the \u221e symbol), but most lenses need to be adjusted slightly to ensure sharp focus. Don\u2019t worry, though, I will teach you two methods: one you can do during the day, and one during the night.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Method One: Preset your focus during the day.**\n\n-Set up your camera with the lens you will be using.\n\n-Adjust your lens for the focal length you will be using; e.g. 24mm on a 14-24mm.\n\n-Focus on a far away object using auto focus.\n\n-Make any manual adjustments using the focus ring if needed. Today\u2019s autofocus is so accurate, I rarely find that any adjustments are needed.\n\n-Take a couple of practice shots at a normal aperture, like f/8. Zoom in on the photo and double check that the object you\u2019re focused on is sharp.\n\n-Once your shot is in focus, you have found your infinity focal point! You can now either tape your focus ring into place or use a marker to mark your exact focus point.\n\n*Keep in mind, your exact focus point will change slightly if you adjust the focal length. If you decide to shoot at 14mm instead of 24mm, you would want to repeat the above steps.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Method two: Using live view at night**\n\n-Set up your tripod with your camera and lens.\n\n-Set your focus ring as close to the \u221e (infinity) symbol as possible.\n\n-Turn on live view and point your camera at the brightest star or object in the sky you can find (moon, planet, etc).\n\n-Find that source of light in live view and zoom all the way in.\n\n-Adjust your focus ring until the dot of light is as small as possible.\n\n-Congratulations, you have found your focal point and can start shooting!!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Milky Way rising above Valley of the Gods - Utah\n](https://imgur.com/6JeIFt5)\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**Camera Settings**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCamera settings can be the most daunting part of learning to shoot the Milky Way. You can get started in most other types of photography with \u201cAuto\u201d and fumble your way through to some okay shots. This doesn\u2019t work at night.\n\nEverything in this settings category is designed around one principal: collect as much light as possible. Stars aren\u2019t very bright, so to photograph them we need to adjust our gear to collect as much light as possible, while keeping optimal image quality. The settings below will help you optimize your camera to capture as many stars as possible.\n\nShooting at night can be especially tricky because it\u2019s dark, making it harder to use your camera. I advise you to practice changing your settings during the day or in your home before you go out in the dark.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^*Changing ^settings ^in ^the ^dark ^can ^be ^hard, ^but ^PLEASE ^don\u2019t ^use ^flashlights ^or ^white ^lights ^if ^you ^are ^shooting ^around ^other ^people. ^If ^you ^have ^a ^headlamp, ^there ^is ^usually ^a ^red ^light ^setting, ^which ^is ^more ^acceptable, ^but ^still ^be ^cautious ^and ^respectful ^when ^using ^it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Image Format**\n\nIf you camera allows it, always shoot in RAW image format.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Aperture/F-Stop**\n\nA basic review of aperture: The smaller your f-stop, the larger your aperture, which means the more light your lens can capture. This is one of the hardest topics to grasp, in my opinion, because it\u2019s counter intuitive. To shoot stars, you want a very large/wide aperture, which means you want a lower f-stop.\n\n- For example, f/8 is a medium f-stop, it has a normal sized aperture. f/16 is a big f-stop, which means it has a small/shallow aperture. And finally, f/2.8 is a small f-stop and has a large/wide aperture.\n\nDepending on your lens, it is usually best to go with your widest aperture (smallest f-stop) and then decrease it slightly.\n\n- For example, if you are shooting with a 24mm f/1.4, I would set it to f/1.4, then bump it up through f1/.6, f/1.8 and finally settle around f/2. You would do this because pushing your lens to its extremes (biggest and smallest apertures) will tend to result in lower image quality.\n\nIf your lens only goes to f/2.8 or f/4, I would recommend skipping the above advice to bump up the aperture.\n\n- This is because at f/2.8 or f/4, you need the ability to capture light more than you need perfect image quality.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Shutter Speed**\n\nYou want a long exposure time to allow your sensor to collect more light. In a perfect world, we would be able to take minute+ long exposures with a low ISO, allowing for a large amount of light collection and a high image quality. Unfortunately, because the Earth spins, the stars move during our long exposures. This means our exposure can only be so long before we get \u201cstar trails\u201d. To make things even more complicated, the longer your focal length, the shorter your exposures can be before your stars start to trail.\n\n- For example, a 16mm lens can usually shoot an exposure time of around 30 seconds, while a 50mm is closer to 10 seconds.\n\nTo prevent star trails and keep your stars pinpoints, we follow the 500 rule. The 500 rule calculates the longest exposure time you can shoot based on your lenses focal length. Keep in mind the 500 rule is just a rule of thumb and not an exact science. Aperture and ISO have no effect on the 500 rule. For full frame cameras: you simply divide 500 by your focal length:\n\n- 16mm lense: 500/16 = 31.25 seconds\n\n- 50mm lense: 500/50 = 10 seconds\n\nFor crop sensor cameras it\u2019s a bit more complicated. You will need to know you camera\u2019s sensor size. A full-frame\u2019s sensor size is 35mm. A nikon crop sensor has a 24mm sensor size. Every camera will be a little different. You divide 35 by your camera's sensor size to get what is called your crop factor. Next, you divide 500 by your focal length times your crop factor\n\n- Nikon crop sensor size = 24mm:\n\n- 35/24 = 1.46 crop factor\n\n- 16mm lense: 500/(16x1.46) = 21.4 seconds\n\n- 50mm lense: 500/(50x1.46) = 6.85 seconds\n\nAs I mentioned, the 500 rule is just a rule of thumb, so make adjustments as needed (zoom in on your LCD and see if there is star trailing).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Rare conditions line up at Mt Baker - Washington](https://imgur.com/UCWiFcz)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**ISO**\n\nISO is usually the last setting you adjust once you have lowered your f-stop and found your longest exposure time. To find the best ISO requires a few test shots. Start with an ISO of around 1600 and take a shot. If it\u2019s too dark, which it probably will be, increase the ISO. Continue increasing the ISO until the Milky Way is clearly visible.\n\nWith a f/2.8 lens, around ISO 6400 was usually my sweet spot. Depending on your camera, you will probably notice a lot of noise (grainy specks) in your photo. You might also run into your max ISO and not be able to go any higher.\n\nHigh ISO capability is the main reason full-frame cameras are suggested for Milky Way photography. They are able to use higher ISO ratings with better image quality.\n\nWe won\u2019t go into them in detail, but the main ways to combat noise and increase photo quality besides a full-frame or in addition to a full-frame camera include:\n\n- Post processing: noise reduction, median image stacking or shooting a pano\n\n- Using a star tracker\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**White Balance**\n\nIf you are shooting in RAW and post process your images, white balance doesn\u2019t matter since you can manually adjust it in processing. I leave my white balance on auto and adjust later.\n\nIf you prefer to have untouched photos, a white balance around 4-5,000K usually works best.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Billions of stars above Mt St Helens, Washington](https://imgur.com/rxgJ2iu)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**Put it all together!**\n\nSome common settings for me:\n\n- ISO6400, 24mm, f/2, 20s - Using a 24mm f/1.4 lens\n\n- ISO6400, 14mm, f/2.8, 30s - Using a 14mm f/2.8 lens\n\nAnd there you have it, my intro guide into Milky Way photography!

rainier with wildflowers, washington](https://imgur.com/dtkggxm)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**topics covered**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n######**camera equipment**\n\n-minimum required equipment\n\n-preferred equipment\n\n######**preparation and planning**\n\n-moon, dark skies, alignment and weather\n\n######**focusing your lens**\n\n-during night or day\n\n######**camera settings**\n\n-manual mode, iso,

to talk about equipment, but it\u2019s honestly one of my least favorite topics. while it is important to know your gear, you will improve your photography much faster by going out and taking shots or viewing other photographers work, rather than researching/buying every piece of gear on the market.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**- minimum required equipment**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**tripod**\n\n-you need a tripod (well built and sturdy). invest now and it will last for years. a cheap tripod will be unsteady, leading to blurry images. i can\u2019t stress enough how important a good tripod is!\n\n###**camera with manual mode**\n\n-manual mode means you can manually adjust the iso, aperture and shutter speed.\n\n###**camera lens with a minimum f/4 aperture**\n\n-the smaller the f-stop (f/4, f/2.8, etc,) the more light your lens can let it. the more light, the more star detail you can capture.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**- preferred equipment**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**tripod**\n\n-a tall, strong tripod with an excellent ball head.\n\n###**full-frame camera**\n\n-while today's crop sensor (and even some point and shoot cameras) can shoot stars, full-frame iso performance will perform better.\n\n###**14-24mm wide angle lenses with minimum f/2.8 aperture**\n\n-my favorite lens for milky way photography is a 24mm f/1.4.\n\n###**shutter release/intervalometer**\n\n-allows for long than 30s exposure times and reduces camera vibrations when pressing the shutter.\n\n###**star tracker**\n\n-a star tracker is a device that attaches to your tripod. you then mount your camera on the device and it follows (tracks) the stars as they move through the sky, allowing for longer exposure times (greater star detail). learn more about exposure times in the camera settings section.\n\n-this item is definitely not necessary, but it will greatly improve the quality of your star shots. to keep things simple, we won\u2019t be going over star trackers in this guide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[milky way above mt st helens, washington](https://imgur.com/6j1unsv)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**preparation and planning**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\npreparation and planning are two of the most important aspects of milky way photography. knowing the moon phase, how much light pollution to expect, where the milky way arm will align and what the weather will be like are some of the biggest factors to a successful outing. you should also try and scout your destination during the daytime. finding -----> locations !!!  and compositions is extremely difficult in the dark.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^*i ^am ^not ^paid ^by ^or ^affiliated ^with ^any ^of ^the ^brands ^listed ^below.\n\n\n###**moon phase**\n\n-the moon is very bright, brighter than you probably remember. a full moon will keep most stars from being visible.\n\n-when shooting the milky way, you usually want to shoot between one week before and one week after a new moon for best results. the closer you are to the new moon, the better.\n\n-tool: you can find moon phases easily online, but i find using either the photographer's ephemeris or the photo pills app is extremely useful.\n\n\n\n###**light pollution/dark skies**\n\n-humans give off a lot of light, especially in big cities. the closer you are to a city, the more this light pollution will affect your image, reducing the number of stars in your shot.\n\n-tool: using a site like darksitefinder.com makes it incredibly easy to see how much light pollution is in your area. the darker the area (blacker), the better it is for milky way shots.\n\n\n\n###**milky way alignment**\n\n-stars move through our sky as the earth rotates. the milky way arm is no different. you will want to know where the milky way arm will be when you\u2019re shooting.\n\n-the most common time to shoot the milky way in the northern hemisphere is march through october.\n\n-tool: using an app like stellarium makes locating the milky way arm easy. i recommend that you set the milky way brightness to 8+ in the advanced settings.\n\n\n\n###**weather**\n\n-weather might be the biggest factor in milky way photography. if it is too cloudy, you won\u2019t be able to see the stars. knowing if clear or cloudy skies are forecasted can help you plan ahead.\n\n-tool: you can find weather data almost anywhere, but a few of my favorites are cleardarksky.com, weather.gov or google weather.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[the night sky above mt hood on a perfectly calm night - oregon\n](https://imgur.com/1gtgoi2)\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**focusing your lens**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nok, you have all the basic gear you need, you\u2019ve done all your planning and preparations, and now it\u2019s time to get out there and shoot! right? well...almost!\n\nwithout a property focused lens, it is impossible to achieve any success at milky way photography. because of this, you will need to know how to focus your lens before you go out shooting. because stars are very far away, one would think you could simply adjust your focus ring to infinity (or the \u221e symbol), but most lenses need to be adjusted slightly to ensure sharp focus. don\u2019t worry, though, i will teach you two methods: one you can do during the day, and one during the night.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**method one: preset your focus during the day.**\n\n-set up your camera with the lens you will be using.\n\n-adjust your lens for the focal length you will be using; e.g. 24mm on a 14-24mm.\n\n-focus on a far away object using auto focus.\n\n-make any manual adjustments using the focus ring if needed. today\u2019s autofocus is so accurate, i rarely find that any adjustments are needed.\n\n-take a couple of practice shots at a normal aperture, like f/8. zoom in on the photo and double check that the object you\u2019re focused on is sharp.\n\n-once your shot is in focus, you have found your infinity focal point! you can now either tape your focus ring into place or use a marker to mark your exact focus point.\n\n*keep in mind, your exact focus point will change slightly if you adjust the focal length. if you decide to shoot at 14mm instead of 24mm, you would want to repeat the above steps.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###**method two: using live view at night**\n\n-set up your tripod with your camera and lens.\n\n-set your focus ring as close to the \u221e (infinity) symbol as possible.\n\n-turn on live view and point your camera at the brightest star or object in the sky you can find (moon, planet, etc).\n\n-find that source of light in live view and zoom all the way in.\n\n-adjust your focus ring until the dot of light is as small as possible.\n\n-congratulations, you have found your focal point and can start shooting!!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[milky

Can be entirely personal, but may need to transfer data if I leave company\n* Amazon Prime\n* No syncing software\n* Not much space on google drive, apple or dropbox (good enough for catalog, not photos). \n\nWhat I want: \n\n1. I plan to use LR CC to move all the photos from various locations to the one main drive. I also want that main drive synced to something online.

How can I find the catalog for the cancelled LRCC?\n3. An online backup option that doesn't cost too much. I'm thinking Prime Photos, but then I think I need syncing software. Recommendations?\n4.

You will need to remember what images you needed and sift through everything. The key element here is typing down the file names as you come across every image. You can't screenshot the images, I've tried it. \n\nNow download Disk Drill. This is the tool that will get you what you need. The reason I recommend EaseUS for browsing is Disk Drill isn't as fast at viewing every file. The files also don't show thumbnails after viewing, and some files don't preview at all. But anyway, all you gotta do is match up the names. Click on each file you want recovered, then start the process. The good thing is Disk Drill also displays the export folder location. But keep in mind there's a 500MB file recovery limit on the trial version. \n\nThis is simply a completely free and safe method I've found to work.

Such pictures are relatable and fun to watch at, rather than boring clicks where one is just staring at the camera.\n\n**3.** Remember to turn off the sound of the camera. At times the \u2018click\u2019 sound can be distracting and can ruin a beautiful candid moment and shot for you.\n\n**4.** You must always be active and ready to capture ; for the entire wedding.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**5.** Keep a keen eye out for what is happening around so you can capture a candid moment.\n\n**6.** Try to take few shots from the hip i.e 3 feet height as this will make the shot look more candid. For this use wider angle setting of the lens.\n\n**7.** Move around your subjects to take different perspective shots. Sometimes a different angle or perspective adds life in a shot.\n\n**8.** Keep your camera and equipment ready at all times, so that you are able to shoot at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\n**9.** You should prefer to scout through the entire wedding venue to capture random shots from all over.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**10.** During the posed photo-shoot of the couple and guests, there are brief moments where they share a glance or have a chit-chat with the guest. You can always turn these moments to your advantage.\n\n**11.** Every family has a set of rituals that are unique and authentic. It is imperative that you capture their culture vividly.\n\n**12.** Capture group photos, laughing faces and dancing people; having fun and frolic and enjoying the festivity.\n\n**13.** Take minute detail shots of bride and groom\u2019s attire like chokers, chuda, lehenga design, jhumka, nose ring, maang tikka, dhoti kurta, bandhgala, turban, kantha, etc.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**14.** While the bride or groom is getting ready, you can take casual photos that show their excitement and nervousness, just before the wedding.\n\n**15.** Twirling bride is a trend these days.

I\u2019m far from an expert in this stuff, so if people have points to add or correct, please feel free! I\u2019d rather have a discussion than some hard rules everyone \u201cmust\u201d follow\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**What gear do you need?**\n\n\nYou obviously need a camera with manual exposure controls and manual focus (metering and autofocus won\u2019t work if you\u2019re using stronger ND filters). \n\n\nThe only other thing you absolutely will need is a way to keep your camera steady for the duration of your exposure. Most of the time that means a tripod, but sometimes you can also use a beanbag, or a conveniently located ledge or bench\u2026\n\n\nIf you want to take long exposure shots during the day you will also need ND filters. They basically reduce the amount of light that reaches the sensor or film by a certain amount of stops. If you don\u2019t have those you\u2019ll never be able to reduce your shutter time enough, even at the lowest iso and smallest aperture. More on those later.\n\n\nMost camera\u2019s have a max shutter speed. On my Canon DSLR (and most other DSLR\u2019s) it\u2019s 30s. On my fuji XT2 it\u2019s 15m (iirc). The way you can get around this and use longer exposure times is by using the camera\u2019s \u201cbulb\u201d mode. This allows the shutter to remain open for as long as you keep the shutter button pressed. Since you obviously don\u2019t want to keep your finger on the shutter button for minutes at a time (and cause camera shake), you\u2019ll also need a remote control (preferably one with a shutter lock). \n\n\nIf you\u2019re shooting long exposure seascapes, one crucial piece of gear you should never forget are a pair of dry socks. Learn from my mistakes...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**ND filters**\n\n\nThere\u2019s many different types of ND filters. There\u2019s 2 types of filters, screw-in filters or square filters using a filter holder. I\u2019m not going into the discussion which is better, each has its advantages and disadvantages. \n\n\nWhen it comes to the ND filter itself, you can get them in many different strengths, usually going from 2 stop filters to 15 stop filters. A 2 stop filter reduces the amount of light by 2 stops, meaning you multiply the needed exposure time by 4. A 15 stop filter similarly reduces the amount of light by 15 stops, so increasing exposure time by 2 ^15. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a different notation for ND filter ratings using 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 notation. Best to google it, since I\u2019m rubbish at formatting tables on reddit\u2026\n\n\nIn my experience, I get the most use out of my 3 and 10 stop filters.  \n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that different brands of filters can cause different kinds of color cast in the images. The Lee big stopper for example is notorious for introducing a blue cast in images. Shoot in RAW to circumvent this. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Composition**\n\n\nI\u2019ll leave this mostly to your own creativity, just a few tips:\n\n\n* Less is more\n* Focus on lines, textures, light and shadow. \n* It\u2019s hard to learn to see how a camera sees a scene compared to our eyes. It\u2019s even harder for long exposure images to learn how to see since there\u2019s an added layer of abstraction. Practice, practice, practice\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Velocity and optimal exposure times**\n\n\nThe exposure time you need will depend on the effect you want in your image, and the velocity of the elements in your image (clouds, water, people, \u2026). \n\n\nHere\u2019s some useful rule of thumbs I learned:\n\n\nFor people: if you want to see the motion blurred silhouettes, aim for an exposure time of 1/2s to at most a few seconds. Longer and people will start disappearing entirely unless they\u2019re standing very still. \n\n\nFor water: if you want to create some motion in the water, aim for an exposure of a few seconds. If you\u2019re shooting at a beach and want to show the motion of the water on the sand, best is to wait until a big wave has hit and the water is retreating. \n\n\nIf you want to get the misty effect where the water seems to disappear almost completely, aim for 1m-2m exposure times or longer. The choppier the water is the longer your exposure time will need to be to smooth it out. (smaller, choppier waves need longer shutter times than big, rolling waves to smooth out, counterintuitively\u2026)\n\n\nTo get motion in the clouds you\u2019ll need shutter times of 2m-5m approximately, depending on the speed of the clouds (wind), and your focal length (longer focal lengths need less time, wider focal lengths need more time). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Workflow**\n\n\nNow onto the interesting part. How do you actually set up and shoot a long exposure after you found an interesting composition?\n\n\nYou\u2019ve gone and looked around your location, and decided on a good composition. The first thing to do is make sure your tripod is set up stable. If you\u2019re shooting on the beach, that means pushing it into the sand until it\u2019s really down. Sometimes up to 10-15cm in the sand in my experience, especially if you\u2019re close to the waterline and the sand is still wet, or if you\u2019re actually in the water. If you\u2019re close to the waterline, before you take the shot make sure to let a wave roll over where your tripod is standing before you take the shot, this will make your tripod sink into the sand further, until it\u2019s really steady. \n\n\nOnce your tripod is set up, get your camera set up. That means focal length, composition fine-tuned, etc. Set all your other filters except the ND filter (I often use a grad ND filter, you might also want to use a polarising filter for example). Once these are set up, set the camera to manual focus and focus where you want the image to be focussed. Usually you\u2019ll be using a small aperture, so you should have plenty of depth of field. Most of the time I\u2019m simply focussed on infinity. \n\n\nHere it\u2019s time to start thinking about exposure. Since you\u2019re on a tripod and the goal is to get a long exposure, you\u2019ll ideally want to use the native iso of your camera. I tend to avoid the expanded low iso values some camera\u2019s can use, but if you need a longer exposure time  it can help in a pinch.\n\n\nThe aperture is set based on the depth of field you want to achieve. I tend to use between F/9 and F/16. Often you\u2019ll have enough depth of field anyway that it actually doesn\u2019t matter that much. \n\n\nBased on this iso and aperture you can meter the correct exposure before the ND filter, this allows you to calculate the exposure with ND filter. (I\u2019ll get to the exposure calculation bit in more detail later, don\u2019t worry)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Calculating the exposure**\n\n\nThis is where I take a test-shot first. This will allow you to check the histogram, see if you need to change anything to your exposure, and do a first basic check of your composition. Refine if needed, otherwise your test-shot will give you your optimal exposure time before the ND filter. \n\n\nCalculating the exposure time after ND filter is easy. Just double your exposure time as many times as your filter blocks stops. That means for a 3 stop filter you multiply by 8 (2^3), for a 10 stop filter by 1024 (2^10). Easy math right. \n\n\nOr if you\u2019re lazy like me, you can just use an app. I like the [ LEE Filters - ProGlass IRND Exposure Guide]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leefilters.leeproglassirnd&amp;hl=nl). It\u2019s free, and has a bunch of useful exposure calculating options. Even a timer. Lee also has a basic app (the blue one), but it doesn\u2019t offer anything this one can\u2019t do better. There\u2019s probably other apps out there that do the same thing, just look around and use that one that you like best. \n\n\nFor myself, I have a few exposure calculations memorized, so I tend to play around a bit with the iso and aperture to get to an easy to remember shutter time. For example, 1/8s shutter time becomes a 2m exposure with a 10 stop filter. So if I get an exposure time of 1/6s, I might just increase the iso to 125 to get 1/8s because I know that with a filter it becomes a nice and even 2m. Don\u2019t be lazy like me, set your iso and aperture correctly and calculate the corresponding shutter time\u2026\n\n\nSo now you have your composition, your camera is focused and you know the exposure needed. All you still need to do is put your ND filter on the camera, and take the shot\u2026", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/bpd00c/guide_to_long_exposure_seascape_photography/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "guide to long exposure (seascape) photography /!/ someone here posted a question regarding long-exposure photography earlier, and i typed up a long response with some tips i learned from better photographers and through experience. \n\n\nsince the question was removed by the mods and pointed toward the daily questions topic, i decided to clean up my reply and post it here as a guide. i\u2019m far from an expert in this stuff, so if people have points to add or correct, please feel free! i\u2019d rather have a discussion than some hard rules everyone \u201cmust\u201d follow\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**what gear do you need?**\n\n\nyou obviously need a camera with manual exposure controls and manual focus (metering and autofocus won\u2019t work if you\u2019re using stronger nd filters). \n\n\nthe only other thing you absolutely will need is a way to keep your camera steady for the duration of your exposure. most of the time that means a tripod, but sometimes you can also use a beanbag, or a conveniently located ledge or bench\u2026\n\n\nif you want to take long exposure shots during the day you will also need nd filters. they basically reduce the amount of light that reaches the sensor or film by a certain amount of stops. if you don\u2019t have those you\u2019ll never be able to reduce your shutter time enough, even at the lowest iso and smallest aperture. more on those later.\n\n\nmost camera\u2019s have a max shutter speed. on my canon dslr (and most other dslr\u2019s) it\u2019s 30s. on my fuji xt2 it\u2019s 15m (iirc). the way you can get around this and use longer exposure times is by using the camera\u2019s \u201cbulb\u201d mode. this allows the shutter to remain open for as long as you keep the shutter button pressed. since you obviously don\u2019t want to keep your finger on the shutter button for minutes at a time (and cause camera shake), you\u2019ll also need a remote control (preferably one with a shutter lock). \n\n\nif you\u2019re shooting long exposure seascapes, one crucial piece of gear you should never forget are a pair of dry socks. learn from my mistakes...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**nd filters**\n\n\nthere\u2019s many different types of nd filters. there\u2019s 2 types of filters, screw-in filters or square filters using a filter holder. i\u2019m not going into the discussion which is better, each has its advantages and disadvantages. \n\n\nwhen it comes to the nd filter itself, you can get them in many different strengths, usually going from 2 stop filters to 15 stop filters. a 2 stop filter reduces the amount of light by 2 stops, meaning you multiply the needed exposure time by 4. a 15 stop filter similarly reduces the amount of light by 15 stops, so increasing exposure time by 2 ^15. \n\n\nthere\u2019s a different notation for nd filter ratings using 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 notation. best to google it, since i\u2019m rubbish at formatting tables on reddit\u2026\n\n\nin my experience, i get the most use out of my 3 and 10 stop filters.  \n\n\none thing to keep in mind is that different brands of filters can cause different kinds of color cast in the images. the lee big stopper for example is notorious for introducing a blue cast in images. shoot in raw to circumvent this. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**composition**\n\n\ni\u2019ll leave this mostly to your own creativity, just a few tips:\n\n\n* less is more\n* focus on lines, textures, light and shadow. \n* it\u2019s hard to learn to see how a camera sees a scene compared to our eyes. it\u2019s even harder for long exposure images to learn how to see since there\u2019s an added layer of abstraction. practice, practice, practice\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**velocity and optimal exposure times**\n\n\nthe exposure time you need will depend on the effect you want in your image, and the velocity of the elements in your image (clouds, water, people, \u2026). \n\n\nhere\u2019s some useful rule of thumbs i learned:\n\n\nfor people: if you want to see the motion blurred silhouettes, aim for an exposure time of 1/2s to at most a few seconds. longer and people will start disappearing entirely unless they\u2019re standing very still. \n\n\nfor water: if you want to create some motion in the water, aim for an exposure of a few seconds. if you\u2019re shooting at a beach and want to show the motion of the water on the sand, best is to wait until a big wave has hit and the water is retreating. \n\n\nif you want to get the misty effect where the water seems to disappear almost completely, aim for 1m-2m exposure times or longer. the choppier the water is the longer your exposure time will need to be to smooth it out. (smaller, choppier waves need longer shutter times than big, rolling waves to smooth out, counterintuitively\u2026)\n\n\nto get motion in the clouds you\u2019ll need shutter times of 2m-5m approximately, depending on the speed of the clouds (wind), and your focal length (longer focal lengths need less time, wider focal lengths need more time). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**workflow**\n\n\nnow onto the interesting part. how do you actually set up and shoot a long exposure after you found an interesting composition?\n\n\nyou\u2019ve gone and looked around your -----> location !!! , and decided on a good composition. the first thing to do is make sure your tripod is set up stable. if you\u2019re shooting on the beach, that means pushing it into the sand until it\u2019s really down. sometimes up to 10-15cm in the sand in my experience, especially if you\u2019re close to the waterline and the sand is still wet, or if you\u2019re actually in the water. if you\u2019re close to the waterline, before you take the shot make sure to let a wave roll over where your tripod is standing before you take the shot, this will make your tripod sink into the sand further, until it\u2019s really steady. \n\n\nonce your tripod is set up, get your camera set up. that means focal length, composition fine-tuned, etc. set all your other filters except the nd filter (i often use a grad nd filter, you might also want to use a polarising filter for example). once these are set up, set the camera to manual focus and focus where you want the image to be focussed. usually you\u2019ll be using a small aperture, so you should have plenty of depth of field. most of the time i\u2019m simply focussed on infinity. \n\n\nhere it\u2019s time to start thinking about exposure. since you\u2019re on a tripod and the goal is to get a long exposure, you\u2019ll ideally want to use the native iso of your camera. i tend to avoid the expanded low iso values some camera\u2019s can use, but if you need a longer exposure time  it can help in a pinch.\n\n\nthe aperture is set based on the depth of field you want to achieve. i tend to use between f/9 and f/16. often you\u2019ll have enough depth of field anyway that it actually doesn\u2019t matter that much. \n\n\nbased on this iso and aperture you can meter the correct exposure before the nd filter, this allows you to calculate the exposure with nd filter. (i\u2019ll get to the exposure calculation bit in more detail later, don\u2019t worry)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**calculating the exposure**\n\n\nthis is where i take a test-shot first. this will allow you to check the histogram, see if you need to change anything to your exposure, and do a first basic check of your composition. refine if needed, otherwise your test-shot will give you your optimal exposure time before the nd filter. \n\n\ncalculating the exposure time after nd filter is easy. just double your exposure time as many times as your filter blocks stops. that means for a 3 stop filter you multiply by 8 (2^3), for a 10 stop filter by 1024 (2^10). easy math right. \n\n\nor if you\u2019re lazy like me, you can just use an app. i like the [ lee filters - proglass irnd exposure guide]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leefilters.leeproglassirnd&amp;hl=nl). it\u2019s free, and has a bunch of useful exposure calculating options. even a timer. lee also has a basic app (the blue one), but it doesn\u2019t offer anything this one can\u2019t do better. there\u2019s probably other apps out there that do the same thing, just look around and use that one that you like best. \n\n\nfor myself, i have a few exposure calculations memorized, so i tend to play around a bit with the iso and aperture to get to an easy to remember shutter time. for example, 1/8s shutter time becomes a 2m exposure with a 10 stop filter. so if i get an exposure time of 1/6s, i might just increase the iso to 125 to get 1/8s because i know that with a filter it becomes a nice and even 2m. don\u2019t be lazy like me, set your iso and aperture correctly and calculate the corresponding shutter time\u2026\n\n\nso now you have your composition, your camera is focused and you know the exposure needed. all you still need to do is put your nd filter on the camera, and take the shot\u2026", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 85719, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 338029, "autor": "Advantix-man", "date": 1562123369000, "content": "Some tips on how to do this shoot ? /!/ I've done paid shoots before, weddings, sports, senior portraits, and candids but nothing like this and honestly I'm a bit rusty I haven't done a paid photoshoot in a while and I'm a bit nervous.

My name is Colin and I am a part-time landscape photographer from the New England area. More specifically, I am based in Maine and photograph fleeting weather events along our coastline. I have been at this for 3 years now and have learned a lot through trial and error. I figured that I would share this information with you all since it has proven to be useful to me.\n\nA little background here. I'm not a full timer. I have a full time job, a small family (mostly dogs), and a few other hobbies that I participate in. Because of this I need to be efficient with my time and energy. This means that when/if I decide to get up for a 5am sunrise, I need to have a reasonably high success rate. If I am going to get a pass from the SO to go out for a sunset until 10PM, I want to use that opportunity effectively.\n\nThis has made weather tracking incredibly important in my photography. I have learned what types of weather lead to what types of light, what to look for in weather patterns, and how to predict these results with reasonable accuracy. So here we go!\n\nNote: This applies to everything except mountain weather. Mountains make their own weather. Reading those forecasts and predicting an outcome is a different ballgame. If you are in the mountains, you need to rely solely on local peak forecasts and IR/visible satellite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anatomy of Good Light**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood light just doesn't happen at random. There are patterns here. These are patterns that you can learn to identify in order to improve your chances of photographing incredible scenes. You can look up what causes a good light on google. But in a nutshell, good light happens during the \"golden hour\" period of the day with **an atmosphere clear of particulates** like dirt and ash. Contrary to what you heard, polluted skies do not lead to good light for landscapes. They lead to diffused, dirty, hazy light. The only atmospheric particulate that I consider good is precipitation. If you get a low sun shining under clouds with rain/snow in the air, it will be wumbo.\n\nA \"clear\" atmosphere still contains sufficient particulates to scatter the sun's rays. The red light present after atmospheric scatter is easily blocked by air particulates because red light is low energy. It doesn't penetrate well at all, hence why large atmospheric particles are bad. A reliable setup for a light show would be a clear/clean line of sight for the sun and a cloud shelf directly above it. Realistically, any scenario where dramatic sunrise or sunset light shines on/under a cloud formation will make for great conditions.\n\nThese conditions are often found before and after storms. Before storms, thick high clouds typically move in over a location. If the sun manages to rise/set under this storm front, the clouds will light up in a bright red fashion. A similar thing happens when a storm system is moving out. The sun rises or sets underneath a departing storm system, creating dramatic conditions. These storms typically bring in low pressure systems and front winds, which clears the atmosphere of haze.\n\nThis whole \"sun shining through clearing in clouds at golden hour\" deal is the main focus of what I am rambling about. That is what I always look for during sunrise or sunset! The type of cloud cover, position of cloud cover, and position of sun is the determining factor for determining my shooting location when dramatic light is forecasted. Ill cover the different types of \"good\" sunrises/sets below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Types of Sunrises/Sunsets**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are primarily three different classifications of sunsets/sunrises in regards to cloud structure that I will be discussing in this post. High, medium, and low clouds. They all can be shot in different ways which I will discuss below. Please note that this list is not exclusive. There are many other scenarios that present themselves. These descriptions just match up nicely with forecasting apps and their \"high/med/low\" cloud options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Type 1: High Cloud Sunrise/Set**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYep! The typical bright red cloud event that appears directly after sunset or before sunrise. This is the type of light that most photographers freak out over. This happens when thicker high clouds are covering your location and a gap is present on the horizon 20-120 miles away. These are slow moving systems and are very easy to predict. They are typically present with incoming/outgoing cloud formations.\n\nThe light during these sort of events happens in a predictable pattern. When the sun is below the horizon the colors will start up to 1.5 hours before sunrise. As sunrise/set approaches color will appear brilliantly towards the direction of the sun. This direction will peak shortly before the sun breaks the horizon. As the sun rises above the horizon, colors facing the direction sunrise will fade and direct light will hit the foreground. If there was a large enough gap, color will now be peaking in the opposite direction. Side light/Front light can work well at this stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBacklit [High Cloud Sunrise](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59235f93c534a5d7bf48dec3/1559009489341-Q95JFTKQSDJKDLOZDC0S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNbLqx_FIYjfhtEsCHEHzad7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UX_hdIVndeO72MD00jTnc1n42Pd5vs4VrV4yXG_EV_fzwRAeN1AbZG4OR41R6pDVyg/NubbleWumboBurner.jpg?format=1000w)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side lit high cloud sunrise](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59235f93c534a5d7bf48dec3/1519679493039-HIXRD7NSONPF6MV5XJJ8/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKbttEHvNsOaoMXE4Y-2z8t7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmb-fA82zaRhWGg5BmJUXFJusnKIgJXvkwlXiQ7lho8DWJIRYkn_7YAxqHeZPDtmKJ/SwirlyWaveRock.jpg?format=500w)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side lit High Cloud Sunset](https://www.colinzwirner.com/rf199stto9b6oasn78h31xhu3zgu6l)\n\nThese sunrises/sets are versatile. You can essentially face any direction and good light will appear. Be warned though: The light doesn't always make it all the way through the cloud shelf. If the gap is too small on the horizon there may not be light behind you post-sunset. The rule of thumb here is: The larger the gap, the higher the chance of side light. If the gap is small, plan to shoot directly into the sun. If the gap is large, you may see 360 degrees of color.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cirrus Cloud Backlit Sunset](https://www.colinzwirner.com/wyi5vheqrngevgea9iz64rewn7uo26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe clouds do not have to be thick to catch the light either! Thin, wispy clouds like the ones seen above can catch light. Not nearly as dramatic as thick clouds with a prominent shelf, but still a pretty sight. These conditions are best shot towards sunset since the sunlight is being obstructed by the clouds. The light simply will not make it far enough to light up the clouds to your left, right, and rear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[High cloud shelf, 1 hour passed sunset](https://www.colinzwirner.com/dk2lc11rukig6bdaoum460sj752tao)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above photo shows a photo I took a full hour after sunset. When your horizon is clear, residual light can stick around for a very long time. Most people leave after they see peak color. Don't do that. Get there early, leave later.\n\n**Type 2: Medium Cloud Sunrise/Set**\n\nThese clouds reflect light a lot like thicker high clouds! The only difference here is that they are lower elevation, so you need to be closer to the edge of the shelf to get that dramatic light. The rule of thumb here is: The lower the cloud height, the closer you need to be to the edge of the cloud shelf for ideal light. For these guys, I want to be 20-30 miles from the edge of the shelf, max. Preferably I would want to be 5 miles away from the edge of the shelf as the light hits.\n\nThe light acts slightly different with these clouds. The color appears for a shorter amount of time and comes on later. You will see the sky turn red 10 minutes before sunrise, and it will actually peak when the sun breaks the horizon. Colors will quickly fade to nothing 5-10 minutes after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side light, Medium Clouds Sunrise - 30 miles from edge of shelf](https://www.colinzwirner.com/xs4s6vq0ac12ev4gl0b2qeed4bu15l)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Back Light - Peaked color under medium clouds right at sunrise](https://www.colinzwirner.com/oay51yx2y0la8hk0sa7dm3ibznunt8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Back Light, 5 miles from gap on horizon.](https://www.colinzwirner.com/y6jizo9p5e76ksvclohay8szd3ajn0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese middle clouds usually form as breakaways from passing cloud formations. Incoming/departing storms sometimes lead or trail with altocumulus or altostratus clouds. These are a little harder to predict because the good ones travel as rogue formations. Small sections of mid-cloud moving at a relatively high speed. The good thing is that there are often clusters of these formations moving in, so a quick look at the IR satellite should tell you where they will end up.\n\nTreat these like high clouds, but keep in mind that the light happens closer to sunrise/set and does not last as long. Be closer to the edge for these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Type 3: Low Cloud Sunrise/Set**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy favorite and most memorable photography experiences happen when these dramatic low cloud formations are moving out. Same rule applies here. The lower the cloud, the closer you want to be to the edge of the shelf. For these low clouds you ideally want to be within a mile or two of the edge if you are shooting into the sun. Less than a mile if you want side light. You want to be directly under the shelf or  slightly in front of it for front light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low Cloud - Edge of shelf \\~2 miles away.](https://www.colinzwirner.com/vrlvbazvv2bme1ubijvbx8q97eap52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low Cloud \\~3-4 miles away, Higher \"Low Cloud\" formation](https://www.colinzwirner.com/je9ozde4shzdz8up18rthbsi2exmzm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not expect much color in the sky when facing the sun under low cloud cover. Not unless you are \\~2-3 miles away. These clouds do not give much room for the sun's light to scatter and reflect. Peak color will last for maybe 2-3 minutes. Work the foreground light in these scenes, Sky should be an afterthought. The impact of the image comes from the light/dark contrasts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low Cloud - Side Light, shelf 2-3 miles away](https://www.colinzwirner.com/2gvxvq7wi8xjdzg7j6l8oedv17sube)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFacing into this low cloud cover isn't always the best idea.

If you catch these wall clouds getting lit up by low elevation sun, the results can be absolutely spectacular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low Cloud - Rain + Direct light = Rainbow](https://www.colinzwirner.com/olpua2gnb3tzm41p7mz7pbszoq9dp3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRain + Clearing + Sun less than 42 degrees elevation = Chance or rainbows. These are actually more common than you would think and arent too hard to predict. Just follow radar information. Find outgoing/incoming rain that coincides with sunset or sunrise. Arrive when sun will be 42 degrees or lower in sky. Wait through rain until sun breaks through clouds. If you get lucky, rainbow time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So how do you predict these conditions?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are apps that you can use to get accurate graphical representations of cloud cover based on weather model data. Oddly enough, I havent seen any of them mentioned here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesktop:TropicalTidbits -  [https://tropicaltidbits.com/](https://tropicaltidbits.com/)\n\n\\- Navigate to cloud maps via: Forecast Models - Regions - Your region (Do not use East, West, Or ConUS, these do not have options for cloud cover) - Upper/Lower dynamics contains all cloud information necessary. Switch weather models via either \"Global\" dropdowns or \"mesoscale\". The two I use most often are GFS and NAM 3km.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGOES Satellites -  [https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php)\\-Select your region and favorite it. I like using the geocolor readout. This is a live feed of IR satellite images, updated every 5 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMobile:Ventusky App\n\n\\-Gives you the same readout as TropicalTidbits but on mobile. Be sure to use the GFS model on here. the GEM model is good too, but don't use that too far out!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGOES Satellite mobile site - Same as desktop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkyFire/TPE - Use this to reinforce your predictions. Do not rely on it. With that said, it is the best standalone sunset/sunrise prediction app. Dont use SunsetWX. It is horrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In Practice -**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will keep an eye on the GFS cloud cover maps to see if it is predicting any incoming/outgoing cloud formations with a gap (clearing) that will line up with sunset or sunrise. I will check the high/med/low cloud maps, and will formulate a basic plan to go out if the forecast looks good. GFS is a great long-term (2-3 days) tool to use to look at rough forecasts and weather patterns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the forecast stays consistent and promising, I will dig deeper into the cloud maps. GFS is good for general predictions, but it isn't precise. I will switch to the GEM/RGEM/NAM3km models when the event is under 24 hours away to get higher resolution information. These models have more detail, but are less accurate over long periods. Hence why we use GFS up until 24 hours before a weather event. These models give me an idea of what the cloud structure will actually look like! After checking these I will nail my location down to a general area, subject to change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, 2 hours before sunrise or set I will check the GOES IR satellite on my phone or desktop. This real time data will give me an accurate, high resolution depiction of what is going on in the sky. It is still accurate when it is dark! My final location will be determined based on how the clouds are moving. **Real time satellite imagery is the only reliable prediction tool. Do not plan a trip based solely on weather models. Always look at IR satellites 1-4 hours before sunset or rise. Extrapolate based on that information. Webcams are also great to see what the weather looks like at a specific location.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still fail with these methods. That is because even IR images do not picture all cloud cover present, especially at night. You may see ideal conditions developing, only to find out that a thick band of fog blocks the sun. It happens, and that is why you should get to know how the weather acts in your local area. Once you understand your local weather patterns your predictions become far more accurate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is probably a little over the top for most people here. But this is what it takes to predict those fleeting, once in a lifetime moments. They happen a lot. You just have to be in the right place at the right time. There is also a lot more to it than this, but these are the basics. The most important rule is to just get out. Go fail. Take a few photos of the weather you got and compare them to the models/IR imagery. What went wrong? how will you avoid that later? Every outing, failure or success, will make you better at this. As you get better at this you will get better photos, since landscape photography is all about being in the right place at the right time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions I will try to answer them. I will also try to make a more comprehensive guide in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can find my work at  [https://www.colinzwirner.com/](https://www.colinzwirner.com/)", "link":

"selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "understanding cloud cover and predicting light for landscape photography - a kinda comprehensive guide /!/ hey r/photography! my name is colin and i am a part-time landscape photographer from the new england area. more specifically, i am based in maine and photograph fleeting weather events along our coastline. i have been at this for 3 years now and have learned a lot through trial and error. i figured that i would share this information with you all since it has proven to be useful to me.\n\na little background here. i'm not a full timer. i have a full time job, a small family (mostly dogs), and a few other hobbies that i participate in. because of this i need to be efficient with my time and energy. this means that when/if i decide to get up for a 5am sunrise, i need to have a reasonably high success rate. if i am going to get a pass from the so to go out for a sunset until 10pm, i want to use that opportunity effectively.\n\nthis has made weather tracking incredibly important in my photography. i have learned what types of weather lead to what types of light, what to look for in weather patterns, and how to predict these results with reasonable accuracy. so here we go!\n\nnote: this applies to everything except mountain weather. mountains make their own weather. reading those forecasts and predicting an outcome is a different ballgame. if you are in the mountains, you need to rely solely on local peak forecasts and ir/visible satellite.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**anatomy of good light**\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ngood light just doesn't happen at random. there are patterns here. these are patterns that you can learn to identify in order to improve your chances of photographing incredible scenes. you can look up what causes a good light on google. but in a nutshell, good light happens during the \"golden hour\" period of the day with **an atmosphere clear of particulates** like dirt and ash. contrary to what you heard, polluted skies do not lead to good light for landscapes. they lead to diffused, dirty, hazy light. the only atmospheric particulate that i consider good is precipitation. if you get a low sun shining under clouds with rain/snow in the air, it will be wumbo.\n\na \"clear\" atmosphere still contains sufficient particulates to scatter the sun's rays. the red light present after atmospheric scatter is easily blocked by air particulates because red light is low energy. it doesn't penetrate well at all, hence why large atmospheric particles are bad. a reliable setup for a light show would be a clear/clean line of sight for the sun and a cloud shelf directly above it. realistically, any scenario where dramatic sunrise or sunset light shines on/under a cloud formation will make for great conditions.\n\nthese conditions are often found before and after storms. before storms, thick high clouds typically move in over a -----> location !!! . if the sun manages to rise/set under this storm front, the clouds will light up in a bright red fashion. a similar thing happens when a storm system is moving out. the sun rises or sets underneath a departing storm system, creating dramatic conditions. these storms typically bring in low pressure systems and front winds, which clears the atmosphere of haze.\n\nthis whole \"sun shining through clearing in clouds at golden hour\" deal is the main focus of what i am rambling about. that is what i always look for during sunrise or sunset! the type of cloud cover, position of cloud cover, and position of sun is the determining factor for determining my shooting location when dramatic light is forecasted. ill cover the different types of \"good\" sunrises/sets below.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**types of sunrises/sunsets**\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthere are primarily three different classifications of sunsets/sunrises in regards to cloud structure that i will be discussing in this post. high, medium, and low clouds. they all can be shot in different ways which i will discuss below. please note that this list is not exclusive. there are many other scenarios that present themselves. these descriptions just match up nicely with forecasting apps and their \"high/med/low\" cloud options.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**type 1: high cloud sunrise/set**\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nyep! the typical bright red cloud event that appears directly after sunset or before sunrise. this is the type of light that most photographers freak out over. this happens when thicker high clouds are covering your location and a gap is present on the horizon 20-120 miles away. these are slow moving systems and are very easy to predict. they are typically present with incoming/outgoing cloud formations.\n\nthe light during these sort of events happens in a predictable pattern. when the sun is below the horizon the colors will start up to 1.5 hours before sunrise. as sunrise/set approaches color will appear brilliantly towards the direction of the sun. this direction will peak shortly before the sun breaks the horizon. as the sun rises above the horizon, colors facing the direction sunrise will fade and direct light will hit the foreground. if there was a large enough gap, color will now be peaking in the opposite direction. side light/front light can work well at this stage.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nbacklit [high cloud

those fleeting, once in a lifetime moments. they happen a lot. you just have to be in the right place at the right time. there is also a lot more to it than this, but these are the basics. the most important rule is to just get out. go fail. take a few photos of the weather you got and compare them to the models/ir imagery. what went wrong? how will you avoid that later? every outing, failure or

My name is Colin and I am a part-time landscape photographer from the New England area. More specifically, I am based in Maine and photograph fleeting weather events along our coastline. I have been at this for 3 years now and have learned a lot through trial and error. I figured that I would share this information with you all since it has proven to be useful to me.  \n\n\nA little background here. I'm not a full timer. I have a full time job, a small family (mostly dogs), and a few other hobbies that I participate in. Because of this I need to be efficient with my time and energy. This means that when/if I decide to get up for a 5am sunrise, I need to have a reasonably high success rate. If I am going to get a pass from the SO to go out for a sunset until 10PM, I want to use that opportunity effectively.   \n\n\nThis has made weather tracking incredibly important in my photography. I have learned what types of weather lead to what types of light, what to look for in weather patterns, and how to predict these results with reasonable accuracy. So here we go!  \n\n\nNote: This applies to everything except mountain weather. Mountains make their own weather. Reading those forecasts and predicting an outcome is a different ballgame. If you are in the mountains, you need to rely solely on local peak forecasts and IR/visible satellite.   \n\n\n**Anatomy of Good Light**  \n\n\nGood light just doesn't happen at random. There are patterns here. These are patterns that you can learn to identify in order to improve your chances of photographing incredible scenes. You can look up what causes a good light on google. But in a nutshell, good light happens during the \"golden hour\" period of the day with **an atmosphere clear of particulates** like dirt and ash. Contrary to what you heard, polluted skies do not lead to good light for landscapes. They lead to diffused, dirty, hazy light. The only atmospheric particulate that I consider good is precipitation. If you get a low sun shining under clouds with rain/snow in the air, it will be wumbo.   \n\n\nA \"clear\" atmosphere still contains sufficient particulates to scatter the sun's rays. The red light present after atmospheric scatter is easily blocked by air particulates because red light is low energy. It doesn't penetrate well at all, hence why large atmospheric particles are bad. A reliable setup for a light show would be a clear/clean line of sight for the sun and a cloud shelf directly above it. Realistically, any scenario where dramatic sunrise or sunset light shines on/under a cloud formation will make for great conditions.   \n\n\nThese conditions are often found before and after storms. Before storms, thick high clouds typically move in over a location. If the sun manages to rise/set under this storm front, the clouds will light up in a bright red fashion. A similar thing happens when a storm system is moving out. The sun rises or sets underneath a departing storm system, creating dramatic conditions. These storms typically bring in low pressure systems and front winds, which clears the atmosphere of haze.   \n\n\nThis whole \"sun shining through clearing in clouds at golden hour\" deal is the main focus of what I am rambling about. That is what I always look for during sunrise or sunset! The type of cloud cover, position of cloud cover, and position of sun is the determining factor for determining my shooting location when dramatic light is forecasted. Ill cover the different types of \"good\" sunrises/sets below.  \n\n\n**Types of Sunrises/Sunsets**  \n\n\nThere are primarily three different classifications of sunsets/sunrises in regards to cloud structure that I will be discussing in this post. High, medium, and low clouds. They all can be shot in different ways which I will discuss below. Please note that this list is not exclusive. There are many other scenarios that present themselves. These descriptions just match up nicely with forecasting apps and their \"high/med/low\" cloud options.   \n\n\n**Type 1: High Cloud Sunrise/Set**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYep! The typical bright red cloud event that appears directly after sunset or before sunrise. This is the type of light that most photographers freak out over. This happens when thicker high clouds are covering your location and a gap is present on the horizon 20-120 miles away. These are slow moving systems and are very easy to predict. They are typically present with incoming/outgoing cloud formations.   \n\n\nThe light during these sort of events happens in a predictable pattern. When the sun is below the horizon the colors will start up to 1.5 hours before sunrise. As sunrise/set approaches color will appear brilliantly towards the direction of the sun. This direction will peak shortly before the sun breaks the horizon. As the sun rises above the horizon, colors facing the direction sunrise will fade and direct light will hit the foreground. If there was a large enough gap, color will now be peaking in the opposite direction. Side light/Front light can work well at this stage.   \n\n\nBacklit [High Cloud Sunrise](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59235f93c534a5d7bf48dec3/1559009489341-Q95JFTKQSDJKDLOZDC0S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNbLqx_FIYjfhtEsCHEHzad7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UX_hdIVndeO72MD00jTnc1n42Pd5vs4VrV4yXG_EV_fzwRAeN1AbZG4OR41R6pDVyg/NubbleWumboBurner.jpg?format=1000w)  \n\n\n[Side lit high cloud sunrise](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59235f93c534a5d7bf48dec3/1519679493039-HIXRD7NSONPF6MV5XJJ8/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKbttEHvNsOaoMXE4Y-2z8t7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmb-fA82zaRhWGg5BmJUXFJusnKIgJXvkwlXiQ7lho8DWJIRYkn_7YAxqHeZPDtmKJ/SwirlyWaveRock.jpg?format=500w)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side lit High Cloud Sunset](https://www.colinzwirner.com/rf199stto9b6oasn78h31xhu3zgu6l)  \n\n\nThese sunrises/sets are versatile. You can essentially face any direction and good light will appear. Be warned though: The light doesn't always make it all the way through the cloud shelf. If the gap is too small on the horizon there may not be light behind you post-sunset. The rule of thumb here is: The larger the gap, the higher the chance of side light. If the gap is small, plan to shoot directly into the sun. If the gap is large, you may see 360 degrees of color. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cirrus Cloud Backlit Sunset](https://www.colinzwirner.com/wyi5vheqrngevgea9iz64rewn7uo26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe clouds do not have to be thick to catch the light either! Thin, wispy clouds like the ones seen above can catch light. Not nearly as dramatic as thick clouds with a prominent shelf, but still a pretty sight. These conditions are best shot towards sunset since the sunlight is being obstructed by the clouds. The light simply will not make it far enough to light up the clouds to your left, right, and rear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[High cloud shelf, 1 hour passed sunset](https://www.colinzwirner.com/dk2lc11rukig6bdaoum460sj752tao)  \n\n\nThe above photo shows a photo I took a full hour after sunset. When your horizon is clear, residual light can stick around for a very long time. Most people leave after they see peak color. Don't do that. Get there early, leave later.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n**Type 2: Medium Cloud Sunrise/Set**  \n\n\nThese clouds reflect light a lot like thicker high clouds! The only difference here is that they are lower elevation, so you need to be closer to the edge of the shelf to get that dramatic light. The rule of thumb here is: The lower the cloud height, the closer you need to be to the edge of the cloud shelf for ideal light. For these guys, I want to be 20-30 miles from the edge of the shelf, max. Preferably I would want to be 5 miles away from the edge of the shelf as the light hits.   \n\n\nThe light acts slightly different with these clouds. The color appears for a shorter amount of time and comes on later. You will see the sky turn red 10 minutes before sunrise, and it will actually peak when the sun breaks the horizon. Colors will quickly fade to nothing 5-10 minutes after.   \n\n\n[Side light, Medium Clouds Sunrise - 30 miles from edge of shelf](https://www.colinzwirner.com/xs4s6vq0ac12ev4gl0b2qeed4bu15l)  \n\n\n[Back Light - Peaked color under medium clouds right at sunrise](https://www.colinzwirner.com/oay51yx2y0la8hk0sa7dm3ibznunt8)  \n\n\n[Back Light, 5 miles from gap on horizon.](https://www.colinzwirner.com/y6jizo9p5e76ksvclohay8szd3ajn0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese middle clouds usually form as breakaways from passing cloud formations. Incoming/departing storms sometimes lead or trail with altocumulus or altostratus clouds. These are a little harder to predict because the good ones travel as rogue formations. Small sections of mid-cloud moving at a relatively high speed. The good thing is that there are often clusters of these formations moving in, so a quick look at the IR satellite should tell you where they will end up.   \n\n\nTreat these like high clouds, but keep in mind that the light happens closer to sunrise/set and does not last as long. Be closer to the edge for these.   \n\n\n**Type 3: Low Cloud Sunrise/Set**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy favorite and most memorable photography experiences happen when these dramatic low cloud formations are moving out. Same rule applies here. The lower the cloud, the closer you want to be to the edge of the shelf. For these low clouds you ideally want to be within a mile or two of the edge if you are shooting into the sun. Less than a mile if you want side light. You want to be directly under the shelf or  slightly in front of it for front light.   \n\n\n[Low Cloud - Edge of shelf \\~2 miles away.](https://www.colinzwirner.com/vrlvbazvv2bme1ubijvbx8q97eap52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low Cloud \\~3-4 miles away, Higher \"Low Cloud\" formation](https://www.colinzwirner.com/je9ozde4shzdz8up18rthbsi2exmzm)  \n\n\nDo not expect much color in the sky when facing the sun under low cloud cover. Not unless you are \\~2-3 miles away. These clouds do not give much room for the sun's light to scatter and reflect. Peak color will last for maybe 2-3 minutes. Work the foreground light in these scenes, Sky should be an afterthought. The impact of the image comes from the light/dark contrasts.   \n\n\n[Low Cloud - Side Light, shelf 2-3 miles away](https://www.colinzwirner.com/2gvxvq7wi8xjdzg7j6l8oedv17sube)  \n\n\nFacing into this low cloud cover isn't always the best idea. Sometimes side light works best!   \n\n\n[Low Cloud - Front light, Shelf directly overhead!](https://www.colinzwirner.com/g8d0w45dkw5efxkpumm30qzpf1peyv)  \n\n\nSometimes low clouds form what is called a \"wall cloud\". If you catch these wall clouds getting lit up by low elevation sun, the results can be absolutely spectacular.   \n\n\n[Low Cloud - Rain + Direct light = Rainbow](https://www.colinzwirner.com/olpua2gnb3tzm41p7mz7pbszoq9dp3)  \n\n\nRain + Clearing + Sun less than 42 degrees elevation = Chance or rainbows. These are actually more common than you would think and arent too hard to predict. Just follow radar information. Find outgoing/incoming rain that coincides with sunset or sunrise. Arrive when sun will be 42 degrees or lower in sky. Wait through rain until sun breaks through clouds. If you get lucky, rainbow time!  \n\n\n**So how do you predict these conditions?**  \n\n\nThere are apps that you can use to get accurate graphical representations of cloud cover based on weather model data. Oddly enough, I havent seen any of them mentioned here.   \n\n\nDesktop:   \nTropicalTidbits -  [https://tropicaltidbits.com/](https://tropicaltidbits.com/) \n\n \\- Navigate to cloud maps via: Forecast Models - Regions - Your region (Do not use East, West, Or ConUS, these do not have options for cloud cover) - Upper/Lower dynamics contains all cloud information necessary. Switch weather models via either \"Global\" dropdowns or \"mesoscale\". The two I use most often are GFS and NAM 3km.    \n\n\nGOES Satellites -  [https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php)   \n\\-Select your region and favorite it. I like using the geocolor readout. This is a live feed of IR satellite images, updated every 5 minutes.   \n\n\nMobile:  \nVentusky App\n\n\\-Gives you the same readout as TropicalTidbits but on mobile. Be sure to use the GFS model on here. the GEM model is good too, but don't use that too far out!  \n\n\nGOES Satellite mobile site\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkyFire/TPE - Use this to reinforce your predictions. Do not rely on it. With that said, it is the best standalone sunset/sunrise prediction app. Dont use SunsetWX. It is horrible.   \n\n\n**In Practice -**   \n\n\nI will keep an eye on the GFS cloud cover maps to see if it is predicting any incoming/outgoing cloud formations with a gap (clearing) that will line up with sunset or sunrise. I will check the high/med/low cloud maps, and will formulate a basic plan to go out if the forecast looks good. GFS is a great long-term (2-3 days) tool to use to look at rough forecasts and weather patterns.   \n\n\nIf the forecast stays consistent and promising, I will dig deeper into the cloud maps. GFS is good for general predictions, but it isn't precise. I will switch to the GEM/RGEM/NAM3km models when the event is under 24 hours away to get higher resolution information. These models have more detail, but are less accurate over long periods. Hence why we use GFS up until 24 hours before a weather event. These models give me an idea of what the cloud structure will actually look like! After checking these I will nail my location down to a general area, subject to change.   \n\n\nFinally, 2 hours before sunrise or set I will check the GOES IR satellite on my phone or desktop. This real time data will give me an accurate, high resolution depiction of what is going on in the sky. It is still accurate when it is dark! My final location will be determined based on how the clouds are moving. **Real time satellite imagery is the only reliable prediction tool. Do not plan a trip based solely on weather models. Always look at IR satellites 1-4 hours before sunset or rise. Extrapolate based on that information. Webcams are also great to see what the weather looks like at a specific location.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still fail with these methods. That is because even IR images do not picture all cloud cover present, especially at night. You may see ideal conditions developing, only to find out that a thick band of fog blocks the sun. It happens, and that is why you should get to know how the weather acts in your local area. Once you understand your local weather patterns your predictions become far more accurate.   \n\n\nThis is probably a little over the top for most people here. But this is what it takes to predict those fleeting, once in a lifetime moments. They happen a lot. You just have to be in the right place at the right time. There is also a lot more to it than this, but these are the basics. The most important rule is to just get out. Go fail.

As you get better at this you will get better photos, since landscape photography is all about being in the right place at the right time!  \n\n\nIf anyone has any questions I will try to answer them. I will also try to make a more comprehensive guide in the future.   \n\n\nYou can find my work at  [https://www.colinzwirner.com/](https://www.colinzwirner.com/)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/cggzbv/methods_for_prediction_light_in_landscape/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "methods for prediction light in landscape photography - a kinda comprehensive guide. /!/ hey r/photography!

  \n\n\n[low cloud - front light, shelf directly overhead!](https://www.colinzwirner.com/g8d0w45dkw5efxkpumm30qzpf1peyv)  \n\n\nsometimes low clouds form what is called a \"wall cloud\". if you catch these wall clouds getting lit up by low elevation sun, the results can be absolutely spectacular.   \n\n\n[low cloud - rain + direct light = rainbow](https://www.colinzwirner.com/olpua2gnb3tzm41p7mz7pbszoq9dp3)  \n\n\nrain + clearing + sun less than 42 degrees elevation = chance or rainbows. these are actually more common than you would think and arent too hard to predict. just follow radar information. find outgoing/incoming rain that coincides with sunset or sunrise. arrive when sun will be 42 degrees or lower in sky. wait through rain until sun breaks through clouds. if you get lucky, rainbow time!  \n\n\n**so how do you predict these conditions?**  \n\n\nthere are apps that you can use to get accurate graphical representations of cloud cover based on weather model data. oddly enough, i havent seen any of them mentioned here.   \n\n\ndesktop:   \ntropicaltidbits -  [https://tropicaltidbits.com/](https://tropicaltidbits.com/) \n\n \\- navigate to cloud maps via: forecast models - regions - your region (do not use east, west, or conus, these do not have options for cloud cover) - upper/lower dynamics contains all cloud information necessary. switch weather models via either \"global\" dropdowns or \"mesoscale\". the two i use most often are gfs and nam 3km.    \n\n\ngoes satellites -  [https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php)   \n\\-select your region and favorite it. i like using the geocolor readout. this is a live feed of ir satellite images, updated every 5 minutes.   \n\n\nmobile:  \nventusky app\n\n\\-gives you the same readout as tropicaltidbits but on mobile. be sure to use the gfs model on here. the gem model is good too, but don't use that too far out!  \n\n\ngoes satellite mobile site\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nskyfire/tpe - use this to reinforce your predictions. do not rely on it. with that said, it is the best standalone sunset/sunrise prediction app. dont use sunsetwx. it is horrible.   \n\n\n**in practice -**   \n\n\ni will keep an eye on the gfs cloud cover maps to see if it is predicting any incoming/outgoing cloud formations with a gap (clearing) that will line up with sunset or sunrise. i will check the high/med/low cloud maps, and will formulate a basic plan to go out if the forecast looks good. gfs is a great long-term (2-3 days) tool to use to look at rough forecasts and weather patterns.   \n\n\nif the forecast stays consistent and promising, i will dig deeper into the cloud maps. gfs is good for general predictions, but it isn't precise. i will switch to the gem/rgem/nam3km models when the event is under 24 hours away to get higher resolution information. these models have more detail, but are less accurate over long periods. hence why we use gfs up until 24 hours before a weather event. these models give me an idea of what the cloud structure will actually look like! after checking these i will nail my location down to a general area, subject to change.   \n\n\nfinally, 2 hours before sunrise or set i will check the goes ir satellite on my phone or desktop. this real time data will give me an accurate, high resolution depiction of what is going on in the sky. it is still accurate when it is dark! my final location will be determined based on how the clouds are moving. **real time satellite imagery is the only reliable prediction tool. do not plan a trip based solely on weather models. always look at ir satellites 1-4 hours before sunset or rise. extrapolate based on that information. webcams are also great to see what the weather looks like at a specific location.** \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni still fail with these methods. that is because even ir images do not picture all cloud cover present, especially at night. you may see ideal conditions developing, only to find out that a thick band of fog blocks the sun. it happens, and that is why you should get to know how the weather acts in your local area. once you understand your local weather patterns your predictions become far more accurate.   \n\n\nthis is probably a little over the top for most people here. but this is what it takes to predict those fleeting, once in a lifetime moments. they happen a lot. you just have to be in the right place at the right time. there is also a lot more to it than this, but these are the basics. the most important rule is to just get out. go fail. take a few photos of the weather you got and compare them to the models/ir imagery. what went wrong? how will you avoid that later? every outing, failure or success, will make you better at this. as you get better at this you will get better photos, since landscape photography is all about being in the right place at the right time!  \n\n\nif anyone has any questions i will try to answer them. i will also try to make a more comprehensive guide in the future.   \n\n\nyou can find my work at  [https://www.colinzwirner.com/](https://www.colinzwirner.com/)", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 86838, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 338876, "autor": "adamxmiller", "date": 1564225393000, "content": "Photography Locations List in Melbourne, Australia. *A LIST LIKE THIS IN EVERY CITY WOULD MAKE ALL OF OUR LIVES EASIER* /!/ [removed]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/cig7rs/photography_locations_list_in_melbourne_australia/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "locations", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "photography -----> locations !!!
