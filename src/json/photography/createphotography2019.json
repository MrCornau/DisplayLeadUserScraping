Thank you for being a part of our community. Thank you for caring about Flickr. Thank you for supporting Flickr. Thank you for being a Flickr Pro.\n\nTwo years ago, Flickr was losing tens of millions of dollars a year. Our company, SmugMug, stepped in to rescue it from being shut down and to save tens of billions of your precious photos from being erased.\n\nWhy? We\u2019ve spent 17 years lovingly building our company into a thriving, family-owned and -operated business that cares deeply about photographers. SmugMug has always been the place for photographers to showcase their photography, and we\u2019ve long admired how Flickr has been the community where they connect with each other. We couldn\u2019t stand by and watch Flickr vanish.\n\nSo we took a big risk, stepped in, and saved Flickr. Together, we created the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community: a place where photographers can stand out and fit in.\n\nAnd yet, Flickr\u2014the world\u2019s most-beloved, money-losing business\u2014still needs your help.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work improving Flickr. We hired an excellent, large staff of Support Heroes who now deliver support with an average customer satisfaction rating of above 90%. We got rid of Yahoo\u2019s login. We moved the platform and every photo to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the industry leader in cloud computing, and modernized its technology along the way. As a result, pages are already 20% faster and photos load 30% more quickly. Platform outages, including Pandas, are way down. Flickr continues to get faster and more stable, and important new features are being built once again.\n\nOur work is never done, but we\u2019ve made tremendous progress.\n\nFlickr still needs your help. It\u2019s still losing money. You, and hundreds of thousands of loyal Flickr members stepped up and joined Flickr Pro, for which we are eternally grateful. It\u2019s losing a lot less money than it was. But it\u2019s not yet making enough.\n\nWe need more Flickr Pro members if we want to keep the Flickr dream alive, and we need your help to share the story of Flickr.\n\nWe didn\u2019t buy Flickr because we thought it was a cash cow. Unlike platforms like Facebook, we also didn\u2019t buy it to invade your privacy and sell your data. We bought it because we love photographers, we love photography, and we believe Flickr deserves not only to live on but thrive. We think the world agrees; and we think the Flickr community does, too. But we cannot continue to operate it at a loss as we\u2019ve been doing.\n\nFlickr is the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community. It\u2019s the world\u2019s best way to find great photography and connect with amazing photographers. Flickr hosts some of the world\u2019s most iconic, most priceless photos, freely available to the entire world. This community is home to more than 100 million accounts and tens of billions of photos. It serves billions of photos every single day. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a priceless treasure for the whole world. And it costs money to operate. Lots of money.\n\nAs you know, Flickr is the best value in photo sharing anywhere in the world. Flickr Pro members get ad-free browsing for themselves and their visitors, advanced stats, unlimited full-quality storage for all their photos, plus premium features and access to the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community.\n\nPlease, help us spread the word. Help us make Flickr thrive. Help us ensure Flickr has a bright future. Every Flickr Pro subscription goes directly to keeping Flickr alive and creating great new experiences for photographers like you.

we\u2019ve spent 17 years lovingly building our company into a thriving, family-owned and -operated business that cares deeply about photographers. smugmug has always been the place for photographers to showcase their photography, and we\u2019ve long admired how flickr has been the community where they connect with each other. we couldn\u2019t stand by and watch flickr vanish.\n\nso we took a big risk, stepped in, and saved flickr. together, -----> we !!!  -----> created !!!  the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community: a place where photographers can stand out and fit in.\n\nand yet, flickr\u2014the world\u2019s most-beloved, money-losing business\u2014still needs your help.\n\nwe\u2019ve been hard at work improving flickr. we hired an excellent, large staff of support heroes who now deliver support with an average customer satisfaction rating of above 90%. we got rid of yahoo\u2019s login. we moved the platform and every photo to amazon web services (aws), the industry leader in cloud computing, and modernized its technology along the way. as a result, pages are already 20% faster and photos load 30% more quickly. platform outages, including pandas, are way down. flickr continues to get faster and more stable, and important new features are being built once again.\n\nour work is never done, but we\u2019ve made tremendous progress.\n\nflickr still needs your help. it\u2019s still losing money. you, and hundreds of thousands of loyal flickr members stepped up and joined flickr pro, for which we are eternally grateful. it\u2019s losing a lot less money than it was. but it\u2019s not yet making enough.\n\nwe need more flickr pro members if we want to keep the flickr dream alive, and we need your help to share the story of flickr.\n\nwe didn\u2019t buy flickr because we thought it was a cash cow. unlike platforms like facebook, we also didn\u2019t buy it to invade your privacy and sell your data. we bought it because we love photographers, we love photography, and we believe flickr deserves not only to live on but thrive. we think the world agrees; and we think the flickr community does, too. but we cannot continue to operate it at a loss as we\u2019ve been doing.\n\nflickr is the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community. it\u2019s the world\u2019s best way to find great photography and connect with amazing photographers. flickr hosts some of the world\u2019s most iconic, most priceless photos, freely available to the entire world. this community is home to more than 100 million accounts and tens of billions of photos. it serves billions of photos every single day. it\u2019s huge. it\u2019s a priceless treasure for the whole world. and it costs money to operate. lots of money.\n\nas you know, flickr is the best value in photo sharing anywhere in the world. flickr pro members get ad-free browsing for themselves and their visitors, advanced stats, unlimited full-quality storage for all their photos, plus premium features and access to the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community.\n\nplease, help us spread the word. help us make flickr thrive. help us ensure flickr has a bright future. every flickr pro subscription goes directly to keeping flickr alive and creating great new experiences for photographers like you. we are building lots of great things for the flickr community, but we need your help. we can do this together.\n\nwe\u2019re launching our end-of-year pro subscription campaign on thursday, december 26, but i want to give you a coupon code to share with friends, family, or anyone who shares your love of photography and community so they can enjoy the same 25% discount before the campaign starts.\n\nwe\u2019ve gone to great lengths to optimize flickr for cost savings wherever possible, but the increasing cost of operating this enormous community and continuing to invest in its future will require a small price increase early in the new year, so this is truly the very best time to help everyone upgrade to a pro membership.\n\nif you value flickr finally being independent, built for photographers and by photographers, we need your help.\n\nwith gratitude,\n\ndon macaskill\nco-founder, ceo &amp; chief geek\nsmugmug + flickr\n\nplease share coupon code 25in2019 or link below to give the gift of 25% off flickr pro now.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=25in2019", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 8107, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "greencn69", "date": "2019-03-13 22:46:15", "content": "Amateur trying to learn something /!/ Hello everyone!

And at B&amp;H, instant means instant \u2014 no expiring points, credits, or coupons to worry about. It\u2019s that simple.

One day in autumn I decided to take a 7000 mile road trip across the United States. I bought a Canon M50 and took photos. When I got back, I sold my Harley and bought a Sony A7R IV with a couple nice lenses. I now live in my Jeep and travel while taking photographs. I am currently in Florida and plan on going back out west to Oregon, Washington, Alaska. My plan is to travel all over the world for the rest of my life.\n\nI am starting to get many people asking to buy my photos. I am so busy traveling, shooting, editing that I haven't had time to really research best practices. I never got into this to make money, its a long story. My pension covers my basic needs and allows me to break away from the 9-5 life. I am gaining hundred of followers on Instagram daily and its hard to keep up with the comments. I also created a 500px account today. Anyone have any advice? I have only been shooting for less than 2 months so I know I have a lot to improve on. I have also been shooting in manual mode early on so I was messing up on my exposures. I am self taught but starting to read books, listen to Podcast and Youtube.\n\nThis photo was taken at the Everglades National Park, off the road in an unassuming location, a ditch. There is concrete all around with road defelctors. It was my first day at the Glades and was conflicted where to shoot. I remembered this spot I was earlier in that day and decided to give it a shot.

I also enjoy watching YouTube videos, tinkering, taking apart everything and after rebuilding them ( not always successful but, hey, look at the bright side- I get a lot of spear parts). \n\n Note: English is not my first language so, please, be kind with my mistakes. Feel free to point my mistakes in this  matter. \n\n But enough about me for now...  \n\n   The project Shutterstockjourney.com\n\n Not long ago, in November 2018, I got in the recommended section of YouTube a video about photography, how to become a better photographer, light, about stock photos, how to get your work, your passion into the world so I said \"hey, why not\" and that's how I stumbled upon the Shutterstock.com website after a simple Google search; I clicked and I was amazed of how many awesome photos are being taken, uploaded, the quality and that was the seed that started to grow in me.  \n\n I had to be apart of this \n\n   Iniatially I created a buyer account and I couldn't find anywhere a link to how to become a member, a contributor  ( I found out this is how we are called after a few searches) and applied with 40 or so images that I considered where my best ones and I waited for them to approve/disapprove my photos. I remember that was a very exciting period,  with many thoughts whether they will like them, if I'm good enough to do this, somehow I wanted so much to be inside, to learn and why not to get something out of this.  The answer came faster then I thought and it was a success, I was finally in YEY! I started uploading photos, doing all the keywords manually (I later found the keyword suggestion tool), titles, descriptions etc.. I remember it took me 9 hours for my first 70 photos ( English was my first stone to carry in this process). I had in total around 100 photos and I had big dreams about this, I started to read about the website, if they had a forum, if I can interact with other users; some of my questions remained to this day unanswered but baby steps, right? \n\n The website shutterstockjourney.com and my first sold picture \n\n Time passed and nothing happened, I continued to take photos, to go out when I had the chance to but somehow I had a bitter taste about this dream, I couldn't find the way to interact with other contributors (not yet), and all the learning process from the pro's resumed to the YouTube creators. Then it happened!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/pxwadohyo4d21.jpg\n\n My first sale on 11/30/2018 was a piece of perforated copper plated PCB board (I told you I like to tinker), my first $0.25!
