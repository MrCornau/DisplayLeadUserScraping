Owned for like 15 years and it hasn't been serviced once. Decided it was time to service it. It was getting progressively harder to start it (with LOTS of black smoke when first started), until the point where it would no longer start at all.\n\nWatched this video on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy9RdTo\\_KwI&amp;ab\\_channel=Repairs101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy9RdTo_KwI&amp;ab_channel=Repairs101) and was like, erm, I don't think I can do this. This guy is a pro and I'm a noob.\n\n# Air Filter\n\nAnyway, I proceeded to take a screwdriver and open the air filter. To my surprise, it was FULL of blueish oil. I then realised there was no way air was getting inside the engine with the air filter like that. Took it apart and removed the sponge and squeezed it. My hand was COVERED in thick oil, whoa. Took it inside and washed it under hot water for a few minutes with plenty of dishwashing liquid. It returned to its original clean yellow colour. Dried it with paper towels etc and put it back together. Screwed it on and fired it up. She started on the second rope pull!\n\n# Engine Oil\n\nWell, I thought now that I've watched the video and seen where the oil drain plug is (on the bottom), might as well open the plug and let it drain out and then fill her up again with some 2 stroke engine oil. So I did that, and got lots of nice (well not so nice really) dark oil. When the oil stopped coming out, I put the oil drain plug back on and filled her up, slowly, checking the dipstick each time. I didn't wanna fire her up immediately, so I first rotated the blade a bit slowly by hand, and then pulled the rope very very gently a few times. No idea if this helps at all, but my idea was to let the oil circulate a bit so the engine wasn't firing up without oil. I bet some of you can comment on this?\n\n# Dirty solid grass on bottom\n\nTook a vacuum (my DIY one) and put the nozzle bit on it and use the nozzle to scrape out all the old grass from the bottom. Well, first scraped off the big chunks without the vacuum on, and then vacuumed all the little bits. Also, I realised there was tonned of long dry grass thingies curled around the self-propelling shaft, so I decided to cut those all off and give it all a good clean.\n\n# The result\n\nShe starts first time, every time. Beautiful. Didn't bother with sharpening the blade as that looked a little labour intensive. She cuts fine how she is. What do you lot think?\n\nI think the extra oil in the air filter was because once upon a time the oil was a little low and she wasn't starting easily so I thought it was a good idea to just pour some more oil in, I didn't even check the dipstick. Could that have been what caused it?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/iq38n2/serviced_my_petrol_lawnmower_that_wasnt_starting/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "gardening", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "serviced my petrol lawnmower that wasn't starting /!/ # how it started\n\nso i have a lawnmower which wasn't starting at all, no matter how many times i pulled the starter rope thing. owned for like 15 years and it hasn't been serviced once. decided it was time to service it. it was getting progressively harder to start it (with lots of black smoke when first started), until the point where it would no longer start at all.\n\nwatched this video on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy9rdto\\_kwi&amp;ab\\_channel=repairs101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy9rdto_kwi&amp;ab_channel=repairs101) and was like, erm, i don't think i can do this. this guy is a pro and i'm a noob.\n\n# air filter\n\nanyway, i proceeded to take a screwdriver and open the air filter. to my surprise, it was full of blueish oil. i then realised there was no way air was getting inside the engine with the air filter like that. took it apart and removed the sponge and squeezed it. my hand was covered in thick oil, whoa. took it inside and washed it under hot water for a few minutes with plenty of dishwashing liquid. it returned to its original clean yellow colour. dried it with paper towels etc and put it back together. screwed it on and fired it up. she started on the second rope pull!\n\n# engine oil\n\nwell, i thought now that i've watched the video and seen where the oil drain plug is (on the bottom), might as well open the plug and let it drain out and then fill her up again with some 2 stroke engine oil. so i did that, and got lots of nice (well not so nice really) dark oil. when the oil stopped coming out, i put the oil drain plug back on and filled her up, slowly, checking the dipstick each time. i didn't wanna fire her up immediately, so i first rotated the blade a bit slowly by hand, and then pulled the rope very very gently a few times. no idea if this helps at all, but my idea was to let the oil circulate a bit so the engine wasn't firing up without oil. i bet some of you can comment on this?\n\n# dirty solid grass on bottom\n\ntook a vacuum (my -----> diy !!!  one) and put the nozzle bit on it and use the nozzle to scrape out all the old grass from the bottom. well, first scraped off the big chunks without the vacuum on, and then vacuumed all the little bits. also, i realised there was tonned of long dry grass thingies curled around the self-propelling shaft, so i decided to cut those all off and give it all a good clean.\n\n# the result\n\nshe starts first time, every time. beautiful. didn't bother with sharpening the blade as that looked a little labour intensive. she cuts fine how she is. what do you lot think?\n\ni think the extra oil in the air filter was because once upon a time the oil was a little low and she wasn't starting easily so i thought it was a good idea to just pour some more oil in, i didn't even check the dipstick. could that have been what caused it?", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 1, "media": "self", "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/iq38n2/serviced_my_petrol_lawnmower_that_wasnt_starting/", "identifyer": 402889, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 406014, "autor": "Expensive_Corgi", "date": 1582071669000, "content": "PLEASE take this survey.
