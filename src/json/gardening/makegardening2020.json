I'm looking for a bit of advice.\n\n\nMy parents have a pretty big garden with a cypress hedge. We blame the previous tenants... JK, I like it, except for the pollen and the waste.\n\nIt's time for the annual hedge trimming and my dad and I have started doing that. He uses an electric hedge trimmer which leaves a ton of small leaves. We used to burn them in the fire pit, but since last year, we don't have the right to make any fire anymore. Indeed, we live in Provence in France, and the area is pretty dry all year long. Fires in gardens have been prohibited and sanctioned.\n\nThat sucks for us, because we end up with a somewhat massive amount of cypress leaves. Last year, my dad put them on the ground, shredded them with the lawnmower, and yote it back under the hedge. But this is far from optimal (he hurt his back doing so, and one year later they're still there so it's not a sustainable solution). \n\nWe know that cypress leaves are acidic. In fact, we used to make a big pile out of them when we burned them, and the grass had trouble growing back afterwards. We also tried to let them dry, but we just end up with [this](https://i.imgur.com/p4Nbsyr.png) - a pile of dried leaves and sticks. \n\n\n\nWe should end up with 3 to 5 cubic meters of fresh leaves. My dad says that if we shred them, we can cut in half the volume. But it's still a massive pile of waste that we don't really know what to do with.\n\n\nWe were thinking about putting them on the driveway to prevent grass from growing, but I'm convinced that when they will dry out, it will be super ugly. (like a brown carpet with a lot of tiny sticks).\n\n\nAnyway, advice is welcome. Do you have any advice? \n\n\nThanks a lot.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/f5wh4y/what_to_do_with_cypress_leaves_waste/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "gardening", "result": true, "Selector": "we used to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "what to do with cypress leaves waste? /!/ hi! i'm looking for a bit of advice.\n\n\nmy parents have a pretty big garden with a cypress hedge. we blame the previous tenants... jk, i like it, except for the pollen and the waste.\n\nit's time for the annual hedge trimming and my dad and i have started doing that. he uses an electric hedge trimmer which leaves a ton of small leaves. we used to burn them in the fire pit, but since last year, we don't have the right to make any fire anymore. indeed, we live in provence in france, and the area is pretty dry all year long. fires in gardens have been prohibited and sanctioned.\n\nthat sucks for us, because we end up with a somewhat massive amount of cypress leaves. last year, my dad put them on the ground, shredded them with the lawnmower, and yote it back under the hedge. but this is far from optimal (he hurt his back doing so, and one year later they're still there so it's not a sustainable solution). \n\nwe know that cypress leaves are acidic. in fact, -----> we !!!  -----> used !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  a big pile out of them when -----> we !!!  burned them, and the grass had trouble growing back afterwards. we also tried to let them dry, but we just end up with [this](https://i.imgur.com/p4nbsyr.png) - a pile of dried leaves and sticks. \n\n\n\nwe should end up with 3 to 5 cubic meters of fresh leaves. my dad says that if we shred them, we can cut in half the volume. but it's still a massive pile of waste that we don't really know what to do with.\n\n\nwe were thinking about putting them on the driveway to prevent grass from growing, but i'm convinced that when they will dry out, it will be super ugly.
