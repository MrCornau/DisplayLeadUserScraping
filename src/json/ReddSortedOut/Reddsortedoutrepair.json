It takes beautiful photos, but in addition to the lack of AF, the lens doesn't tell the body what its focal length is, so I have to set and use the non-CPU lens settings to get the EXIF tags populated and what not. Also, sadly, once in a while, I can't set the aperture using the body's wheel, and I have to un-mount/re-mount the lens to get it to work on any other f-stop. The LCD just displays f/13 or whatever I had it set on last and will not change when I spin the wheel. So the electronics in the lens are fried. But in months of ownership and fairly frequent use, that's only happened twice, and it's pretty easily \"fixed\". I got the lens pretty cheap and really only use it for macro, so I don't have a _big_ problem with this.\n\nI'm pretty sure I can pop the dandelion off the lens, cut and/or file any bits of conductor I see left sticking out from the lens body and attach one of the inexpensive \"dandelion chips\" off of eBay for $25 or so and have this fixed, or at least working as a MF lens that identifies itself to the body. Has anyone done anything like this, or know if this will work? Is there anything I need to watch out for?\n\nThanks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/aogenc/question_about_diy_minor_repair_on_nikon_105mm/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": false, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "question about diy minor -----> repair !!!  on nikon 105mm micro f/2.8 af lens /!/", "sortedWord": "repair", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 1484, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "tangomango737", "date": "2020-09-03 18:00:52", "content": "D700 mirror stuck.
