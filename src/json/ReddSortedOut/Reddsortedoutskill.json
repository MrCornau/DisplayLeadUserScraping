I currently own a Sony A7iii as well as the Zeiss 16-35 f4 and Sony 24-105 f4. I'm also bringing along my a6000 body as a backup and potentially use it when I need a more lightweight, compact option. \n\nI typically shoot landscapes but I would like to make sure the lenses I take along will allow me to adequately shoot in the wide variety of situations I'll find myself in, especially street photography, which is something I'd like to improve my skill in. I would like to also get more into astro but not having a lens for purpose is not a deal breaker.\n\nHaving traveled with these lenses in the past I typically shoot with the 24-105 around 80-90% of the time and I consider it an indispensable general purpose lens.  \n\nHowever, I generally use the Zeiss 16-35 f4 on a tripod for planned compositions, typically at the wider end of its focal length. This has led me to consider whether a lighter, faster, cheaper wide angle prime such as the Samyang AF 14mm f2.8 would be just as adequate for this purpose, especially while travelling where weight is a consideration. I could then use the extra cash to buy another lightweight prime like the Sony 50mm f1.8 to be used for street photography. \n\nWhat your thoughts are on the above lens options or is there another lens combination that you think I should consider? \n\nThanks :) ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/ai9bww/travel_lens_combinations_for_a7iii_should_i_swap/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": false, "Selector": "i would like to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "\n\ni typically shoot landscapes but i would like to make sure the lenses i take along will allow me to adequately shoot in the wide variety of situations i'll find myself in, especially street photography, which is something i'd like to improve my -----> skill !!!  in.", "sortedWord": "skill", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 17354, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "factysays", "date": "2020-06-20 07:01:35", "content": "FREE Advanced Adobe Photoshop Course /!/ Photography is an art.

I live on a relatively small island so seascapes, landscapes etc are abundant.  Anyway I have been feeling that I have exhausted all the spots on my island, visiting them throughout the years in different seasons, different light, times of day to get the best shots of the area.\n\nBut as of late, really since the beginning of the year it just doesn't seem to be cutting it anymore, I feel like its rinse and repeat, over and over again and since my other work has been slow since wedding have been cancelled and my other part time job I only work 10 hours a week it has got me into somewhat of a rut.\n\nI was looking back at my first few years of photographs from around 15-18 years ago, shooting on film, self developing and they all have such a quality to them, I look at them and I see this story, of my friends and I, hanging out, life growing up and it suddenly felt that I don't have this emotional connection with any of my current landscape images, my newer work or any photographs I have taken in the last 3-5 years.  \n\nI stopping picking up my camera, no clients and no desire to get out shooting so I just stopped.  This went on for a few weeks and I began to pick up my older DSLR and film camera and just casually shooting a couple of weeks ago, not really paying much attention but just trying to have fun, I watched a few youtube videos earlier this week and I began to think about what photography really meant to me.  I wanted to meditate on this idea and get some thoughts down on paper, this is what I wrote:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018What does photography mean to me?\u00a0 Looking back at the beginning of my photography journey I\u2019m not sure if it is nostalgia or just the great (but not always) memories but everything (the photographs) seem to have a more of a magical sparkle to them.\u00a0 Things are just too easy now, I have every variable available to me at all times in post production that it seems to be a wish-list of skills and looks that is just rinse and repeat, image after image.*\n\n*Not photograph after photograph, these digital recreations of time is but a digital fingerprint of where I have been and what I have seen.\u00a0 Emptiness, lifeless landscape image with nobody to share them with.\u00a0 They only become photographs either when I print them to bring them into the physical world, or when that moment of capture is shared with somebody else.*\n\n*I have been a slave to the digital realm, focusing on sharpness, colour, micro-contrast, focus stacking, exposure bracketing, like seeking nothingness and it has not made me any happier, I think far from it.\u00a0 And has it moulded me into an inferior photography?*\n\n*Maybe\u2026*\n\n*Digital darkroom, photographic enhancement, luminosity masks and AI algorithms to stitch 120 megapixel monsters, pointless.\u00a0 Look at me, I have the latest PANIKONY MK7ii with XY2 lens and every other accessory available to man.\u00a0 But it is ok to use these, the question is should I?*\n\n*The landscapes I create used to mean so much to me finding perfection everywhere I go, the best light, composition, what filters, how to process and it all very well said and done, I have learnt many skills along the way, but at what sacrifice?\u00a0 To no longer look at the world with fresh eyes, but just to see a look, a feed, no story soul or meaning.*\n\n*I want to narrow my focus, and that focus has to be relevant and have meaning, at least to me.\u00a0 It is all about the story after all isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 To narrow my focus on the things that really mean something to me, my friends, family and life.\u00a0 Adventure is everywhere, I feel like I was in such a rush to quit Funky (old job) and have time, that I quit more than that job when I left.\u00a0 My work ethic has changed inside me, my fuel and fire has dwindled as I have had more opportunities.*\n\n*Is it because I feel I must suffer to succeed, No.\u00a0 But I need to be challenged, to be inquisitive, to be interested.\u00a0 Maybe if I was more interested in my own landscape images then somebody else would be too.\u00a0 I think thats why I made them, for others to look at, but I\u2019m still not sure what they see when they look at them.\u00a0 There is no story or meaning to them and I\u2019m not sure if just beauty is enough.*\n\n*Im not sure that this is a moment of self doubt, nut more the lines of realisation that a photographer can be whoever they want to be.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to fit into genres or follow trends.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to create new trends or even bring back old ones.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to be bold and think big, they don\u2019t need to be perfect and have all the answers.\u00a0 I think the only thing a photographer needs is the passion to tell a story.\u00a0 And I think it's time I carried on telling the only story I know.\u00a0 Mine.\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt like this really challenged my beliefs on what I was trying to do and get out of my images, where I wanted to see them and question who I was really pleasing.  Myself, a random person, or another photographer.  I think that its important to take steps back and re-evaluate whats happening in your photographic journey at whatever skill level you might be at.\n\nIt has led me to believe that I am just not that bothered about landscapes anymore and I don't really want to carry on pursuing them.  I am going back to older projects and coming up with new ideas of projects I want to do in the future to create the work that really means something to me.  \n\nIf you are relatively new to photography I think you should ask yourself what kind of images would you like to look back on in 20 years, what will tell that story for you.  If you are picking up a camera just to get likes and follow trends then you might just be wasting your time, and money.\n\nIf you are an experienced photographer I ask you this; \n\nWhat does photography mean to you and what are your goals or projects you are working on that captivates you over long periods of time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a follow up video about my journal entry the next day which is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XktF0GMqFgQ) if you want to check it out.\n\nAnd I also made a blog post discussing the same thoughts and ideas behind my struggles with storytelling in photography [here](https://www.luismoraisphoto.com/blog/my-struggles-with-storytelling-in-photography) if you want to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and have a great day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuis", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/go1awk/struggling_with_storytelling_in_photography/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": false, "Selector": "i create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "but it is ok to use these, the question is should i?*\n\n*the landscapes i create used to mean so much to me finding perfection everywhere i go, the best light, composition, what filters, how to process and it all very well said and done, i have learnt many -----> skills !!!  along the way, but at what sacrifice?\u00a0 to no longer look at the world with fresh eyes, but just to see a look, a feed, no story soul or meaning.", "sortedWord": "skill", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 69291, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Nuka-Cola1", "date": "2020-06-06 09:41:59", "content": "Can anyone recommend what lenses to use for different types of photography /!/ Hi, \n\nI'm new to all off this and I would love some advice.

I ended up walking by a \"Little Free Library\" - not sure if these are \"a thing\" in other parts of the world, but my town is heavily populated with these little things that look like a small cupboard on a pole, usually filled with random books or items for passers-by to take and enjoy. It was pretty dark so I used my phone flashlight to peek inside but didn't see anything that appealed to me. However, I did notice a cardboard box on the ground next to the Little Free Library, so I peeked in the box too. The box was mostly filled with kids books written in Chinese (I think - again, it was super dark), and just as I was about to give up, I spotted something unexpected: a camera lens. I dug a little deeper, and [here's what I ended up finding at the bottom of the box](https://imgur.com/a/P6jO5Ir): a Nikon F-301 SLR camera with a Nikkor 35-105mm zoom lens, a Sunpak flash unit, a small flipbook filled with colored lenses that slot into the flash unit, and a Sigma lens which looks to my untrained eye like it's intended for a newer Canon camera.

Recently I've been in touch with some friends who have opened a restaurant and I offered to come by and help them with photographs of the space and menus. I made sure that I was up front about my skill level. I spent many years working in restaurants so I know my way around them and always thought it would be cool to offer some marketing help as a side gig. This seemed like a good opportunity to learn and get experience with relatively low stakes.\n\nFor the shoot I arrived in early afternoon just as the restaurant was opening and shot till 9pm or so. I had my Sony A7iii, 90mm f2.8 macro, a 24mm f1.4, and a Speedlight with diffuser along with some modifiers.\n\n1.) Communication. These guys are my friends and they're very busy at the moment with the chaos of opening a new place, so communication with them about the date and time of my arrival was sporadic. In short, if I did this for paying clients I would insist on as much detail as possible. Where will I be shooting? How long will I have? How many dishes/cocktails will I shoot? Can I be near natural light (window) and still out of the way? \n\nBecause these details hadn't been worked out in advance, I worried needlessly over how much equipment to bring, how to organize my shoot, and what my shot list should be.\n\n2.) Timing when shooting a restaurant is really key. Time of day is important. You may want people in the restaurant so as to get some pictures of the place looking busy, but if it's too busy then the kitchen won't have time to make you dishes. If happy hour is popping off, the bartender isn't going to have time to make you cocktails. If you allow the chef to bombard you with dishes, garnishes may wilt, sauces will separate, and things will dry out before you're ready for them.\n\nSome things I'd do differently with future clients:\n\nPreparation: Visit the site prior to a shoot to take test shots of the space and identify good locations for setting up and shooting. Identify a shot list of things I want to catch during service. Where can I stand to get pictures of the line and be out of the way? Where will I be when the bar is packed during happy hour?
