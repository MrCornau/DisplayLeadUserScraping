I would like to write this post for people that, in 2019, are looking for information about this lens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fact is: when you google about it, you find mostly two things: the image quality is superb, the autofocus is crap. Unfortunately, this is true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe autofocus of my lens with my old D7100 was bad. Very bad indeed. The next day I bought this camera, I went to the store to purchase the Sigma dock in order to do fine tuning. When I exchanged my camera with the D7200, it was also awful. However, when I reset the configurations, then it was much better than it was initially with D7100. In fact, I achieved an acceptable behavior using the in-camera fine tuning adjustments. Thus, the autofocus quality really depends on your camera and lens.  \n\n\nHowever, after a good fine tuning of the autofocus, what you get is just amazing, because the image quality is superb. In fact, I don't think there is other DX zoom lens with such good quality for Nikon. The process to fine-tuning the lens is painful at best, but you will not regret. What I did was to develop a setup using a cardboard box and a ruler similar to that in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmxtddLfPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmxtddLfPM)   \n\n\nThe process is straightforward: positioning the camera away from the object by one of the distances indicated in the Sigma dock app, take the shots using 18, 24, 28, and 35mm, and check the focus. In all cases, I shot with f1.8. Then, plug the lens into the dock, open the app and adjust. If it is back-focused, then increase the number, otherwise, decrease it. The biggest problem is that, at least for me, the settings were not independent. When I changed the number for, let's say, 24 mm, then the auto-focus behavior using 28mm also changed. Thus, it is a very long try-and-error process that must be repeated for all four distances (0.28m, 0.35m, 0.5m, and infinity) The results for my setup can be seen here: [https://imgur.com/ImMF9Av](https://imgur.com/ImMF9Av)  \n\n\nHere is an example of an image after the calibration process (0.28m, 35mm): [https://imgur.com/6DB57IQ](https://imgur.com/6DB57IQ)   \n\n\nI was not able to verify using the focus at infinity due to my room constraints :D However, in my case, the focus at infinity is very good. After all this process, you realize why this lens is so good. I really would like to do not have to go through all of this, but the image you get after it is just amazing considering the price of it.  \n\n\nWell, I hope this post helps people that want to buy this lens to use in Nikon bodies :)  \n\n\nTL;DR: If you want to buy Sigma 18-35mm to be used in a Nikon body, you would probably need the sigma dock to make micro adjustments in the focus. If you cannot rent it, then buy it! After that, you will probably have the best DX lens in terms of image quality for Nikon.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/c99r7t/nikon_and_sigma_1835mm_f18_in_2019/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": false, "Selector": "i did was to develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "what i did was to develop a setup using a cardboard box and a ruler similar to that in this -----> video !!! :", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 735, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "clairvoyant_basic", "date": "2019-09-14 11:15:24", "content": "I love to make video with nikon - Not really", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/d43vra/i_love_to_make_video_with_nikon_not_really/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": false, "Selector": "i love to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i love to make -----> video !!!  with nikon - not really", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 982, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "alaschgari", "date": "2019-04-19 19:41:33", "content": "Sony picture profile video look like photo RAW /!/ Hi!\n\nI want to create a Sony picture profile for video that looks like I shoot a raw photo image.\n\nThe reason for this is that I want to make the colorgrading in Lightroom (grading a still of the footage).

So after almost a week of research and playing around with actual cameras, I've grown to love the Sony a5000/5100 style of camera despite its shortcomings such as no way of having an external mic. The thing, I don't know how big of a difference in quality there is between the two models!

Thing is that I see them always around the $400 range +-50 online (and at that point I may as well buy it new for $448 at my local Best Buy). Is it worth the difference in price or should I stick with this a5000 and roll with it?

Since the Z6ii and the Z7ii seem to be almost the same body, I would assume all of the below information will work for the Z6ii as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently purchased a Nikon Z7ii and DJI RS2 to add to my kit for video and photo work. When I was doing my research, it was before the Z7ii was available and I have yet to find anyone posting this information even on YouTube. I hope to make a video soon explaining this stuff too so that others can have an easier time than I did. I don't know if I will hit every bullet point here, but if you have specific questions, I will try and answer them as quick as possible.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Balancing is easy as can be with all different lenses and lenses don't appear to make a difference in functionality. The arms are stiff to slide with it being new, if you can't get it to slide, the locking lever lifts up and you can adjust it further to loosen it more. I have only tried Z mount lenses so far on the gimbal because my wife has our F mount lenses with her on a trip.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) If you buy the DJI RS2 Pro Combo from B&amp;H with the Nanuk Case included, they do not give you any layout diagram to put all the stuff in it. Also, I did have to do some customization, I can add photo's later if anyone wants to see it.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) I mounted a Manfrotto 323RC2 quick release onto the DJI supplied camera riser plate (arca swiss mount) and attached a 200pl to my camera. Now I can quickly move my camera to any of my manfrotto tripod/monopods and back onto the gimbal without having to adjust anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) RS2/Camera compatibility: This one was a little more difficult because my RS2 did not initially prompt me of a firmware update. Long story short, the RS2 has a firmware update to version\u00a0[01.02.00.30](https://1.2.0.30/)\u00a0that needs to be done for the best compatibility. Without this firmware, you will have major issues between the raven eye/gimbal/camera. Also, the raven eye had a firmware update although I don't believe that had anything to do with the issues I was having.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) The Z7ii needs to be switched between photo/video mode on the camera itself in order to control that recording method on the gimbal. Without making this change, you will not record/take a photo if you are in the wrong mode. When using raven eye, the selector button on your phone does not actually change it on the camera. When the camera is in video mode, and the cables are attached, on the RS2, just press the record button to start/stop the recording. When in photo mode, hold the record button in and pull the trigger to take a photo.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) Active track: I need to do some fine tuning still, but here's what I have found so far once I have everything set up. On a 50mm f/1.8s lens, the initial settings of active track had a speed of 20. This caused the camera to swing back and forth faster and faster over compensating until it eventually lost the target from the frame. I turned this down to 10, and that helped, turning it down to 1 did not work. There are other adjustments I will be making and I will test other lenses to see if that makes a difference. First impression though is the active track is about as good as on my original Mavic Air. Conceptually awesome, sort of works, I'm sure it will get better in time. I will use it if I am willing to reshoot something multiple times to get it right, otherwise, 1 time shots will not be trusted with it yet.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) Camera settings: I did not come across any specific camera settings that affected functionality of the RS2 other than DJI specifically states in a video to set your camera to AF-C or AF-S (the do not mention AF-F, but I am using AF-F for video and it works perfectly, including the focus wheel.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8) Camera specific settings: I recommend a video by Hudson Henry Photography ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do0Va7wciTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do0Va7wciTs)) I did not use all of his specific settings, but he does a fantastic job walking you through the menu and explaining things to change and such.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick review of each piece-\n\nCamera: The autofocus is great! In AF-F mode (video only) it rarely does any focus breathing, but only if objects move in/out very fast. As for tracking my face for vlog style recording, or panning around the room and such, it is doing a fantastic job. Nikon has not traditionally been known for video autofocus, that award goes to Sony, however I do believe Nikon has really stepped up their game and I took a risk buying this camera and I am very happy I did. I will continue testing the different focus modes to see how they all work, but so far I am happy with the single point, wide area, and auto area. I haven't been able to practically test the animal detect yet, but the face/eye detect seems to be very responsive. I love all of the customization you can do for the user settings. I wish Nikon would make their screens fold around to the front view, and I wish Nikon would ditch the video break up of 30 minutes, but those are my only 2 complaints at this time with this camera.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFTZ adapter: I have only briefly used it to test it out and my biggest complaint is that if I have a 200PL plate on my camera, I cannot mount the FTZ adapter onto the camera. I have to remove the plate from my camera and use it on the FTZ (I have one dedicated on there, but I still have to remove it from my camera to put the adapter on).\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRS2: This is my first gimbal so I have nothing to compare it to. I stated my issues above and know there is a learning curve with this. I do not regret this purchase and look forward to creating with it. I recommend you watch other people's reviews of it for better information about how it functions as a gimbal. But since I could not find anyone online discussing this gimbal/camera combination I wanted to make a post and tell you all it can be done. I wish in the pro combo kit, another extended grip would be included for the briefcase handle because once I remove it from the bottom of the battery grip, the whole thing can't stand on its own. I will be buying something to attach there, but it is frustrating that it is not included. Also, the phone mount that is include gets in the way of my pan arm and my phone keeps getting hit, it needs either another 1\" extension or to have an offset angle. I have not used the focus wheel motor yet so I cannot speak to that, I do not have any manual lenses at this time so I do not specifically need to use it yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, I will try and answer them the best I can.\u00a0", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/kl71ck/nikon_z_7ii_with_dji_rs2_functionality_and/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": false, "Selector": "i hope to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i hope to make a -----> video !!!  soon explaining this stuff too so that others can have an easier time than i did.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 24546, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "KnightDuty", "date": "2020-04-12 18:58:49", "content": "What lens 'fits' my camera? /!/ I just got a D3200 to brush up with (I haven't used a DSLR since college maybe 12 years ago).\n\nI will mainly be using this to capture textures and assets for my CG work.

He's an Alpha shooter just like all of us, but as soon as I started watching one of his videos I realized how GOOD they looked. This is the moment I realized that I'm very subpar in what I do.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? I'll explain. I've always had a strong passion for photo &amp; video work. Even though I tend to stress and obsess on ideas, I don't put them into play nearly as much as I would like to. My 9-5 has made me too burnt out to actually go out and hit record, even though my mind is constantly wanting to. I might make 1-2 videos a year. It's a weird spot to be in and I'm having a very hard time getting out of it.\n\nThis ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7p6PhaFM9g&amp;t=380s)) is my most recent piece of work (get a few minutes in, that's when I switch to my A6500). Upon finishing it I was very proud. Looking back I was probably just proud that I actually completed a project start to finish. But putting it side by side to Ryan's videos, it made me realize how my colors, my shots, my music, almost everything seemed laughable compared to Ryan's. I then took it a step further and noticed 95% of the other channels I follow also look much better than mine. Womp womp.\n\nNow I'm not usually one to compare to others, as part of the creative process is shooting what you want to shoot. But it's hard to look at both pieces of work side by side and not get down on yourself about it. That being said, it's inspired me to actually learn the process of making great looking video and hone in on that until I'm happy with my quality.\n\nNow for the question - seeing my work and the work I'm referencing, what tips would you give me going forward to learn my process better. I use an A6500 with the Sony 18-105mm and Sigma 16mm lenses. Was eyeing the A7III but quickly realized the camera isn't the issue - it's me.\n\nI appreciate it if you made it this far.

Seems like the best bang for buck cam for live streaming and video creation, etc. \n\nA few questions if someone could please help (I love this community): \n\n1. If I set this up with my PC, would I need a dummy battery for it so it wont die half way through making a video or live steaming?\n2. To connect it to my PC to stream and create Youtube videos, do I just need an Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter, Elgato Camlink 4k, and the dummy battery? \n3. I wanted to mount the cam to my table above my screen, any suggestions on mounting this (i.e. products) and having the ability to move it? Or is it best to get a tripod?\n4. Can I plug my Blue Yeti mic into the cam (and if so how would you monitor this)? -looks like there is a mic jack, just wanting some suggestions here)\n5.  It seems like people prefer to stream using the 'Sigma 16mm f/1.4 DC DN Contemporary Lens for Sony' possibly because it has a good wide angle view - any thoughts on this ? it looks like this lens costs slightly less than the cam itself! \n6.  I've got a gaming PC and have a decent setup, if I was to make videos using say 1080p quality and 4k quality, on average what would the size be for say a 10 min video, shot in the different  qualities?\n7.

Now I did some research about Full-Frame and I found out that it isn't necessarily better and it really depends on what you need.\n\nI'm planning on doing more professional work with a friend and I think it would be 70% photos - 30% video. We started making videos but also want to offer photography soon. And my friend is going to buy a video camera like the BlackMagic Pocket, so I thought a more photography centered camera with decent video capabilities would be smart so we can make good photos but also both film when we need to. (7R2 as the 2nd video cam)\n\nBut now I looked into the Sony a6XXX lineup and compared them to the 7R2. And at this point I just don't know if my purchase was smart after all and if I shouldn't have gone with an a6500 for example. That would cost about 650\u20ac without a lens though. So the price difference for the body isn't really that much (about 200\u20ac). But I read that lenses are gonna be much more expensive for Full-Frame, and that the advantages over APS-C aren't that big. But do I really have to spend that much more? I saw some good FF primes for around 500-600\u20ac. Are they significantly worse than APS-C lenses at that price point?\n\nI know that the a6500 is better at video, but by how much? And the a7RII is better a photography, but is that significant enough to outweigh the other advantages of the a6500?\n\nWhat I also couldn't really figure out is how they perform in low light. Is there a difference between video and photo, and which camera is better?\n\nAnd I know that \"the best camera is the one you have with you\" and that my skills as the operator of the cam are crucial to the outcome.

If this is the wrong sub for this question I apologize, but hopefully this is relevant to a lot of people on the sub. \n\nLike many people with a smartphone, I take a couple dozen photos/videos on my phone (Android) every day for various reasons. The \"Big 3\" reasons I take pictures are for my job, friends/family, and taking videos of my workouts. Sorting through which photos go into which album after I take the picture/video is super annoying and changing the save location every time I want to take a picture/video is equally impractical. I have developed a work around that lets me pre-sort my photos/videos, but it's a bit convoluted so maybe somebody has a better method? Here's what I do:\n\nI have 3 different camera apps on my phone and each one is set up to save to a different folder: \n\n* Camera App #1 saves all pictures/videos to a \"Work\" folder on my phone, which then FolderSync then syncs to a Google Drive folder associated with my work email address.\n* Camera App #2 saves all pictures/videos to a \"Friends&amp;Family\" folder, which FolderSync then syncs to a Google Drive folder (GDrive Friends &amp; Family) that is associated with my personal email address.\n* Camera App #3 saves all pictures/videos to a \"Workout\" folder, which FolderSync then syncs to a different Google drive folder (GDrive Workout) that is also associated with me personal email address.\n\nSo, I pre-sort my photos by taking pictures using a different camera app for each category and tie it all together with FolderSync. It seems kind of insane to me that I'm using 4 different apps to make this work, and unfortunately this means I need another camera app for each folder I want to pre-sort pictures into, so my work around solution isn't scalable at all. \n\nI can't imagine I'm the only person that wants to pre-sort their pictures and videos! I found another app called Camera Files Manager that is pretty new that seems to solve this problem by letting the user select the save folder from a dropdown menu overlay on the camera preview screen before taking the picture/video. This seems perfect! However, the camera flash doesn't work when using this app, and the app seems like it is from a small indie developer so its unclear what kind of long-term support it will get.\n\nAnybody have any brilliant ideas?

In the last year, I really got into videography after helping my dad with recipe and cooking videos (he sells high-end kitchen supply products) that we later published on social to drive brand awareness. I managed all of my dad's social from creating the content to publishing to reporting for both paid and organic. Long story short, since shelter-in-place, we pivoted to Facebook Live and have averaged 15k\\~ in sales monthly. We're doing live cooking videos 2x a week, an hour each, and doing giveaways/mass texting our client list to get people to join. \n\nWhy:  \nI'll like to combine everything I love: photography, videography, social, marketing, and helping small businesses and make a business out of it. \n\nService:  \nI want to help small businesses increase their brand awareness by creating social content for them and managing their social channels. I would go and shoot at their place 1-2x a month eg: coffee shop, restaurant, etc, and build out an organic social content strategy that consists of scheduling posts and managing their reporting  - they can also go into paid if that's something they may want too. The way people are communicating and engaging is through social so it's important for brands to have an authentic identity online driven by high-quality and engaging content. Through this content, you increase brand awareness and stay top of mind; build a connection with your customer, and gain trust. \n\nStarting:   \nI need to build out a portfolio with imagery/video smaller businesses can find relevant and see themselves having for their own business. I did mention I've been photographing on/off for 10 years but I feel that imagery doesn't align as I did mostly portraits and street so I'm not sure if it's something I want to show as my portfolio. In order to build relationships with smaller businesses and build out a relevant portfolio, I'll like to start off by offering free images/video for social and asking to just be credited via a tagged post so their followers can hear about me. This will also allow me to have content to publish on my own social and showcase my work + build out my portfolio. \n\nHow will I find people?  \n I plan to start off by DMing local businesses giving them a short background of what I'm looking to do and if they would be interested in what I'm offering for FREE.

Not mine at all /!/ Sorry for my failures in advance, not native - Greetings from Austria! After I started serious photography at the beginning of 2018, I collected much experience in these 2 years, for the very basics I made a course at a friend of my mother, watched many, many videos and read in forums. After a few months I was able to shoot manually with my newly aquiered 70D, shot over 15,000 pictures in 2018 and 2019, but I didn\u2018t stop learning online and got better and better, and I\u2018m still learning new things nearly every day.\n\nSo now to the title: In these 2 years, I tried many genres of photography: from macro-planespotting, many different diciplines. After a time I recogniced that I love to do events, and in my free time, landscapes and nature. Regulary I shoot portraits, which I also like. There are some genres I like more, others I like less, but until now there is only 1, I can\u2019t be friends with. Street Photography!\n\nI tried it at least 10 times or more. I watched dozens of videos, as I did with events or portraits, but I can\u2018t find anything interesting about it. In my home city-Vienna I barely find interesting scenes, and If I do, they aren\u2019t interesting anymore in editing and just look boring. So my motivation for street is declining every time I try, and today, I think it was the last time I tried. Was in Vienna for a couple of hours, 10 shots - all boring. I simply can\u2019t get warm with it. \nThat\u2019s my story hope you liked it a little bit. \nMaybe you have tips to get myself into street photography, would be happy to hear some!\n\nFelix", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ekjibz/street_photography_not_mine_at_all/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": false, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "after i started serious photography at the beginning of 2018, i collected much experience in these 2 years, for the very basics i made a course at a friend of my mother, watched many, many -----> videos !!!  and read in forums.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 87547, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "StartupSensei", "date": "2020-01-22 18:03:41", "content": "GoPro for product photography?? /!/ Hey, sorry in advance I am a complete photography noob.

Although it's cheap, reviews of the lens are that it's average and kinda bland.

There was even a post recently about feeling limited as a \u201csmall town\u201d photographer. When you are struggling for motivation in your photography, please consider the long-term potential of your photos becoming history.\n\nOne area of study that is extremely important to me is that of \u201cphotography-as-memories.\u201d Media in general is essential to communication and remembering. However, over time, it seems some of the original, sensory-based synaptic connections of many of our non-traumatic memories begin to fade away and are progressively replaced by newer neurological imprints that are made up of re-enactments \u2013 stories, photos and other recordings \u2013 that we engage with through the years. In this way, our memory-media collections are invaluable and irreplaceable when it comes to remembering our pasts, whether personal, cultural or historical. A comprehensive library of personal memory-media that we can display, share and engage with makes for more reflective, emotional and vivid memory recall experiences that refresh, create and refine our autobiographical self-narratives. In these ways, media not only helps to construct and preserve memories - media becomes memories.   \n(Full blog post about how media becomes memories \u2013 including citations! - here: [Memory Media Solutions blog: Media as Memories](http://memorymediasolutions.com/MMSBlog.html#when%20media%20becomes%20memories))\n\nFor me as a media academic, contemporary photography is something like Dorothea Lange meets Wikipedia \u2013 an accumulation of media that provides a vision of a historical period.

I'm hoping to avoid all this by developing and scanning at home. I've watched countless videos on developing, and after I get my 3 rolls back I'll have a better idea of which black and white films look best with my style. \n\nThe one thing I've seen conflicting answers about is scanning. I've seen people say that flatbeds aren't good for 35mm, but also that dedicated 35mm scanners aren't built very well and also come with the disadvantage of being limited to 35mm film only.

My main profession is as a web designer and front-end developer, but I've been manipulating images and painting with my Wacom in Photoshop for close to 20 years.\n\nI'm using the 6D to shoot both stills for a website and to make some short, silent video clips (around 10 secs each) to create some cinemagraphs in After Effects. The lenses I currently have access to are the Canon EF 24-70mm f/4L IS USM and the Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM (I absolutely LOVE the macro lens for a lot of the stills.) Honestly all the images come out perfect, but I'm struggling a bit on the video end... all of the video seems like it's marginally better than what I can shoot with my phone, with the exception of having the lenses. Most of the video is all shot with a tripod and is either of a landscape or a close up subject with shallow depth of field.\n\nI've seen some people take some really great video with the 6D, and I was wondering if the magic is in adjustments to camera settings or in the post-processing in Premiere or After Effects. I've seen some recommendations to use Magic Lantern, I haven't tried this yet but I will give it a shot. Are there things I should always be doing in post-processing video similar to if I was using Photoshop for images? Any recommendations I could get from people who regularly shoot video would be greatly appreciated...

I learned that the t5i will hit the 4GB file size limit in about 12m05s but compensates for this by starting a new video right away, which was great. I also learned that, for a show that went extremely long, four batteries and three 32GB SD cards was cutting it close. I\u2019ll be better prepared on that end next time.\n\nNow having the resulting videos, I wanted to ask for tips on how I could improve (samples at the bottom).\n\nHere were the circumstances and my approach:\n\nI was sitting in an lecture auditorium that some student groups now use for stage plays and productions like the one I was asked to film. The students rented a t5i with a 18-135mm lens. Originally I tried standing at the back of the auditorium and filming from there, but everything looked sort of blobby, so I instead took a seat around 10-15 rows up from the front and used a tripod. Thankfully, nobody tall wanted to sit in front of me and the people sitting behind me also didn\u2019t mind. My technique was to allow the autofocus to set the focus of the camera at first, and then flip the camera into manual so that nothing would change throughout the recording (which has happened to me in a different venue but I couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to fix it on the fly, so I ended up getting a really blurry last minute or so of a performance.)\n\nThe play/musical had three different general lighting patterns. The first was all lights on stage up. The second was lights dim with spotlights. The third was stage lights out with spotlights. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to try to adjust for this on the fly because I hadn\u2019t seen the show before and didn\u2019t know when the lights transitions would be, so instead I hedged my bets and went for the previously mentioned AF method at the beginning of each act and left it as is. The result is that the scenes with the most light look great, while especially in the scenes with just spotlights, the people on stage look really blown out.\n\nI used the onboard mic for all of the audio recording and this ended up being sort of okay. Some of the dialogue and rapping is a bit muddled, but there was little I could do about it. There are mics that the students could have rented, but I didn\u2019t know how to make a recommendation for this not having ever used a mic with a DSLR before.\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n*For people who have shot video in these situations before, is there anything I should have been paying attention to or settings I should have been using / practicing more with to figure out how to improve the recordings, in terms of visual quality?\n*In the same situation, how much will a separate mic make a difference_x0010_? In an ideal world I think I\u2019d set up a mic on stage and then sync it to the video, but that\u2019s a bit more effort than I think I could expend on this project (also these students contacted me just ten days before the show to ask if I could do this.)\n*There are a handful of other lenses available through their student tech rental program. One of them is a macro so I know it wouldn\u2019t matter here, but the other was a 70-200mm. It wasn\u2019t available this time, but I\u2019m thinking that one might have been useful if I had set up in the back of the auditorium. I think the tradeoff there would be that recording sound would have been even more difficult. Any takes on that approach?\n\nSample videos are below, reflecting each of the three main lighting situations. Any tips on how I can improve or things I should practice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n*Lights up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL3ke1QqJp0\n*Lights half down (with spotlight): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyqwRfxuzg4\n*Lights down (with color spotlight): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCoLjM9xP8o&amp;t=4m16s\n*Lights down (with neutral spotlight): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-dflcQzx_M&amp;t=2m43s (this is also not helped by one of the actresses wearing an all white dress)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/8n3qrq/improving_video_technique_auditoriumstage_show/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": false, "Selector": "improving", "selectorShort": "improve", "MarkedSent": "improving -----> video !!!  technique (auditorium/stage show, fixed location) /!/", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 24378, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "alexdomino", "date": "2018-07-05 01:46:32", "content": "Can I make a videos that looks like this with a canon Eos rebel ? /!/ [removed]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/8w6rbj/can_i_make_a_videos_that_looks_like_this_with_a/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": false, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "can i make a -----> videos !!!  that looks like this with a canon eos rebel ? /!/", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 24489, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "ProofEntertainment53", "date": "2021-01-28 21:15:51", "content": "SLog vs HLG /!/ Which would you pick for video? \n\nContext: \nSo I currently make YouTube videos, they are all filmed in my bedroom with adequate lighting and with the a6400.

So many options and features. I have used a DSLR before and mess around with it and knows the basic. ISO, Aperture, what it does, etc. But I'm still a beginner. I just ordered my first camera. A Sony ZV-E10 since I heard it is good for video. Bought it on impulse after seeing the 'Cinematic' videos taken on YouTube and I'm impressed by it. So I ordered it without looking back. (I actually ordered the A6400. That camera is hyped up and seemingly used by YouTuber so I jumped on that hype train. But discovered the ZV-E10 and cancelled the A6400)\n\nWhile waiting for my Sony to arrive, watching videos of it everyday due to excitement, I also came to understand that the APS-C sensor, causes rolling shutters. And I understand that to be the jello looking video when you move your camera. \n\nNow, I make a guitar cover video on YouTube. Previously using my Samsung Note 20 Ultra on 4k 60p. And soon, using the Sony ZV-E10 as an upgrade. So my question is that, will the rolling shutter issue, have an effect if I am the one going fast, doing fast guitar movements up and down the neck of the guitar. The camera sits still and I am the one who moves fast. I know if the camera that is shaking, there will be rolling shutter. \nAppreciate any advice and tips. Thank you\n\nPS: Can someone justify, convince and reassure me that I am making an upgrade. A worthwhile investment buying this Sony. I am trying to convince myself that a DSLR should be better at video. Right? Eventhough my Samsung Note 20 Ultra can do 4k 60p, and have pro video mode so I can adjust. It looks decent so far. But a mirrorless camera, should be better in details, low light and stuff, right?

Nikon seems to have given up on DX since the D3, releasing precious few \"pro\" lenses in the format.

I've had it for about a month and it's been fantastic. Yesterday, I went to use it and it has developed an issue with focusing. \n\nThe issue is, when I try to focus it will jump/jitter back and forth past the target. Eventually, it may settle on the target in focus, other times it may just give up (or settle out of focus). This issue is worse when the change in focus range is greater. For example, going from close to very far, or vice versa.\n\nThe autofocus squeals a bit, but it has always been fast and sharp to focus. The focus ring and zoom ring both turn nicely and smoothly by hand. With the lens cap on the focus runs quickly and for the entire range.\n\nWhen I use the lens in live view, it does not have this issue. However, it seems to be very slow to focus. I know live view uses a different method of finding focus, so perhaps this is normal. I don't know how fast it should be, because I never use live view. It is not a useable speed for a moving target.\n\nI have tried the following:\n\n1. Using different lenses on the same body (D750) - they all work perfectly.\n2. Using the 80-200 lens on a different body (D5500) - it has the same issue.\n3. Cleaning the contacts on the lens and camera.\n4. Checked to ensure the ribbon cable has not popped up below the focus gauge (common issue, it pops up and impedes focus movement. The issue/fix is on YouTube).\n\nHere is a short video I made demonstrating the symptoms: [https://youtu.be/Y0fxJm2fJKY](https://youtu.be/Y0fxJm2fJKY)\n\nI do not want to send this to Nikon Canada due to shipping costs and the lack of an estimate in advance. I have also heard they may not have parts available for this lens. If I have to I will take it to a local shop. If it's a costly issue I would probably buy the 80-200 AF-D and sell this lens 'as is.' I am willing to attempt repairs myself, depending on how deep I have to dive into the lens.\n\nIf you have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this.

Help me choose my camera upgrade :) /!/ #Skip to the bottom if you don't have time to read and just want to know my question.\n\nHey everyone. So I'm currently using a little point and shoot Sony RX100 M2 as my main camera. I make YouTube videos, and those videos are mostly just me sitting in front of a camera, nothing too fancy, but occasionally I'll make some b-roll/background footage. I also do enjoy taking photos.\n\n---\n\nI've wanted to upgrade for quite some time now. There are a few reasons, but the big three:\n\n- **Shallower depth of field:** The RX100M2 is actually pretty damn amazing for video quality considering both its age and the fact that it's a little point-and-shoot thing. However I'd really like a shallower depth of field in those videos where I'm talking to the camera. I feel like it looks a little more professional, and I do in fact earn my living from products/services I sell on my YouTube channel, so looking professional does help my revenue!\n- **Mic port:** Unfortunately the RX100 M2 has no microphone port, and the build in mic isn't great. I've considered buying an external mic but I really didn't want to add more woes to the editing process (which is already my least favourite part of video creation) with having to sync up the audio etc. So I want to upgrade to something with a microphone input so I can use whatever mic I like.\n- **Interchangeable lenses:** While I've been fine with the lens on the RX100 M2, I do like the ability of being able to upgrade and buy new glass down the line, whether it be for video or photo purposes. \n- **Bonus reason:** I've just kinda always wanted a DSLR or a mirrorless. I love the way larger cameras feel and operate, and I've wanted one for ages but literally never owned one.\n\n---\n\nAnyway I've been looking at cameras and been torn by my choices. My budget is probably 4000PLN (Polish zloty) or less, which translates to about $1160, but that should include the main lens I'll be using, and also I believe cameras are cheaper in the US than here so I might only be able to get the equivalent of what you guys would get for say $850 or $950.\n\nI want something that provides shallow depth of field than my current camera, that gives a significant upgrade in video quality, but that also produces great stills since while video is my priority professionally, I love taking photos as a hobby. I'd rather have a camera that did excellent video and excellent photos, than one that did AMAZING video but only very good photos. If that makes sense?\n\n---\n\n**Anyway, my main question itself:** I've been learning about colour grading recently, and trying to get the flattest video possible from my current camera. That's when I discovered Log, RAW, etc and that you really want one of these flat profile options on your camera if you want to be doing colour grading.\n\nI definitely want to get the most out of colour grading my video since I think it's one of those things that really makes a good video stand out. So I would really like a camera that can give really flat video that I can grade as I like later.\n\nI discovered that many of the cameras I considered don't seem to have these features.\n\nSo my question is does anyone know of any cameras in my budget that do?\n\n---\n\n#TL;DR I want a camera that's:\n\n- Under 4000PLN (about $1160) including lens. Note that I'm in Poland, and some cameras that are within budget in the US, are more expensive here sadly. Also, this is the absolute upper end of my budget, if I really stretch, but I would love it if I could get something closer to sub 3000PLN, or even less.\n- New, I'd rather not buy used, just for peace of mind's sake.\n- Excellent for both video and photos (although video is the priority, it shouldn't be such a priority that the photo quality isn't great)\n- Has decently shallow depth of field\n- Has interchangeable lenses\n- Has a mic port\n- Perhaps most important: **Lets me shoot RAW video, or has S-Log, V-Log or one of these other profiles that gives me really flat video that I can colour grade easily later.**\n\nI would also REALLY prefer if it had a flip out screen so I could see myself when recording, but I've gotten used to not having that on my RX100 M2 so that's not a dealbreaker if everything else about the camera is solid.\n\nI would also prefer if the camera does 4K, but I'm not 100% sure if I do really need 4K or not, so again, probably not a deal-breaker.\n\nA couple of candidates I already am looking at and considering:\n\n- Panasonic Lumix G7. It seems to produce great video and get great reviews. It shoots at 4K and doesn't seem to have overheating problems when doing so. It's also within my *preferred* lower budget, i.e. sub 3000PLN. It seems to be what everyone recommends for what I'm looking for. Downsides are the smaller sensor so photo quality may suffer, and the thing is I'm not sure if it can produce really flat video like more expensive cameras, as I hear that the Cinelike-D profile that it offers isn't really the same thing. \n- Panasonic Lumix G85. More expensive, but has built in image stabilisation, while the Sony would require me to buy special lenses for that, or to shell out more and buy the A6500 (which is simply too expensive, so not an option)\n- Sony A6300. I'm absolutely blown away by the video quality this thing can achieve. I've had a good experience with my current Sony camera. I also do have access to some old Minolta lenses that I could use on it if I bought the right adapter. The major plus is it has S-Log. Major downside: The overheating issues I hear people have at 4K, and it's a couple hundred PLN over budget currently, so I'd have to wait a little longer to buy it. If it's worth it, and I can get past the overheating somehow, then it sounds perfect.\n\nAnother option is the new Canon EOS M50, which seems to be the cheapest 4K camera with an APS-C sensor, and so maybe the best budget option for both photo and video.. but apparently the crop factor when recording in 4K is really weird, and apparently it also lacks C-Log or the ability to use Magic Lantern, so I'm not sure. \n\nI'm also considering the Sony A7, just because it seems like it dropped in price by about 700PLN recently, finally placing it within my budget, and I'd get a full frame camera. Downsides: Only 1080p (although I don't *need* 4K, it would be nice to have still) and that it also lacks S-Log which the A6300 has. Still very tempted though, if nothing else just for that super shallow depth of field that full frame would allow me to have.\n\n---\n\nAny suggestions?

I've bought WAY too much and need advice on what will ultimately work best for me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a fairly serious enthusiast photographer. I enjoy landscape work, night long exposures, action shots (wakeboarding, airplanes, dogs running, etc.), and typical travel snapshots. Although I generally just do snapshots while traveling, I still take the time to properly compose images and think about what I want to get from the images, but I don't sit for hours waiting for proper light. I occasionally do people photos. I'd like to get into event photos, but I don't plan to do paid work.  \n\n\nI used to shoot with a Nikon D40 and upgraded to a Canon 70D. I always had just two lenses - a 18-55 and a tele zoom. A few months ago, I began to realize I didn't take many pictures with my 70D other than vacations because it was just a little on the larger side and that deterred me from bringing it, so i bought a Sony A6300 with the two lenses and sold the 70D.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoyed the A6300 and was blown away by the advanced AF system and the excellent 4k videos.  But I just missed the DSLR experience and the feel of a DSLR and I felt the pictures from the a6300 just weren't AS good out of the camera, so I sold the a6300 and got an 80D and a 4k camcorder.  Then i realized that the whole reason I bought mirrorless was for the size, so i re-bought the A6300, this time with an 18-135.  My 80D felt redundant, so I upgraded to a 6D mark II and got several bargain priced used f2.8 L lenses for it. Now i felt I was in a good situation as I could use the A6300 for portability and the Canon for quality when I needed it.  \n\n\nSo now I own the following:\n\nA6300 with a couple primes and a 18-135 and a 16-50 for portability.\n\n6d Mark II with the holy trinity, the mid zoom being 24-105 f4 but the others being f2.8. And a couple cheap primes.\n\nSony AX53 4k camcorder.  I really enjoy the stabilization and the zoom is great for aviation shots, but the quality isn't as nice as the A6300's 4k. I like to make a yearly \"home video\"; I don't do any serious cinematic work. But often times the video ends up being iphone clips and other camera shots, so the main reason I feel good about the camcorder is the aviation shots.  \n\n\nThe problem is, I feel this is way too much. I really enjoy the canon F2.8 lenses, but I feel they don't offer value for what I do. I don't professionally shoot and I think something like a crop camera with some 1.8 primes would give me similar enough results without making me feel guilty about owning so much expensive glass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to have one camera or one photo camera and the 4k camcorder. I'm open to selling everything or keeping some of it and swapping around.  I feel the best option for me is a crop DSLR and the camcorder or only owning the A6300 but i'm just not sure.  There's not a great cheap tele zoom for the A6300 which is frustrating to me.  The 55-210 isn't enough reach sometimes and it's not the best quality.    \n\n\nI've bought way too much in too short a time. I've gotten great images from all cameras.

If I get the Lumix, am I limited to lens choices? \n\nThe video below is ideally what I'd like to create my content around.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AzrltvaeJY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AzrltvaeJY)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/e70n9x/lumix_fz300_or_canon_t6i/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": false, "Selector": "i'd like to create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "\n\nthe -----> video !!!  below is ideally what i'd like to create my content around.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 79490, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "novagiant", "date": "2019-02-15 04:08:55", "content": "Need a professional camera /!/ I am a starting streamer and video/photographer, I am looking at the Sony a7sII but all the places I am looking at, it's not even mentioned.

I have been into photography in the past (although still at amateur level), but I have not been practicing it since... Well, when was the Nikon D7000 launched?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for an all-around camera for my many projects. However, I feel that my budget is not quite enough for what I want. Therefore, after weeks of researching, I have finally decided to ask the pro's (you guys), in hopes that someone here can help me out. So here we go:  \n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\nMy budget is around **2,300 USD** / **2,000 Euro** \\- all inclusive. \n\nI should mention that I have no lenses or other equipment (except for a *R\u00f8de* microphone); so with the budget I have, it might be a tall order to fulfil all my needs/wants as stated below. But I hope you guys have some advice and suggestions.\n\n*\\*I live in europe, so I cannot take advantages of special deals outside of EU, without having to pay a heavy tax fee. However,* [*Amazon.co.uk*](https://Amazon.co.uk) and other european sites are fine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPOSE**\n\nI have various projects in the air, and I often find myself in situations, where a good DSLR or mirrorless would come in handy. I will not be using the camera as a way to make an income, since I am not a professional photographer or videographer, therefore it would not make sense to spend extra on special features that I will not be able to use sufficiently anyway.   \n\n\nHere are some of the major projects I plan to use the camera for:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** I have started a school for kids in the slums of Mandaue (a city in the Philippines). I want to document the lives of the children. Therefore, the camera should be great for street photography and portraits - and preferably also good in low light situations, since the lighting in the area is often poor due to lack of proper electricity sources.  \n\n\nThese pictures I took with a smart phone, but they represent the style of photography I am looking for:   \n\n\n[One of the students at Hay Nako Art Club](https://i.redd.it/bdlolf45nvj21.jpg)\n\n  \n\n\n[A kid from the slum](https://i.redd.it/9p1js1f9nvj21.jpg)\n\n**2)** I am going to make small documentary videos as well. For this reason, 4k is a priority for me. I won't be filming high speed or slow-mo or anything too difficult, so 60fps 4k is not a necessity.  \n\n\n**3)** I will also do some simple youtube-style vlogs. Just me sitting in a room, talking. I might also use it to film my lectures (I teach human rights and other law subjects).   \n\n\n**4)** The camera should be all around, so that I can use it for future projects as well. To me, this is important, since I do start new projects often, and therefore cannot know exactly what I will need in the future.  \n\n\n**WHAT I HOPE TO GET**\n\nWell, I do have a wish list - but taken my budget into account, I am aware that I might not be able to get it all. To me, a used camera and equipment is fine, as long as the camera works as it should. But here are what I hope to get:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** A camera house - DSLR or mirrorless. Preferably with 24 megapixels or above, and 4k 30fps or above. The sensor size is not too important, as long as the lens take the crop factor into account for smaller sensors.  \n\n\n**2)** 1 lens, prime or zoom - preferably somewhere in the range of 18-55mm (e.g. 35mm prime would be fine). Even though I want it as all around as possible, I have come to the conclusion that I don't really need anything above 80mm for now, taken my purposes into consideration (does that sound right?).  \n\n\n**3)** Depending on the camera, a battery grib could come in handy. For example, cameras like the Fujifilm X-T3 has very poor battery life, and thus would not make much sense to buy without extra juice, while other cameras might not need this.. Right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** A tripod. It does not have to be anything fancy.  \n\n\n**5)** If there's any budget left (which would be a miracle), some studio lighting would come in handy for the vlogging. However, it should not be anything big or fancy, since I do not have space for a big setup anyways, and will mostly need it for simple portrait-styled video.  \n\n\n**WHAT HAVE I CONSIDERED SO FAR?**\n\nWell - I have considered quite a few. My favourite's are by far the Sony A7iii and the Fujifilm X-T3 - however, I don't think it is realistic to get any of those + the needed equipment, if I want to stay within my budget. Another option I have thought of is the Fujifilm X-T30. The issue with this is, that it is a new camera, and I still hear mixed reviews on it. The great thing about the X-T30 is, of course, the lower price range (approximately $899 for the body).  \n\n\nTherefor, I am still very open to suggestions, and the brand name is not too important (as long as it is a recognised brand).  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat is the best possible all around camera (minimum requirements of 24 megapixels and 4k 30fps) + a lens, I can get within my budget of 2,300 USD / 2,000 Euro?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/awss97/need_advice_from_the_experts_what_should_i_get/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": false, "Selector": "i am going to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "  \n\n\n[one of the students at hay nako art club](https://i.redd.it/bdlolf45nvj21.jpg)\n\n  \n\n\n[a kid from the slum](https://i.redd.it/9p1js1f9nvj21.jpg)\n\n**2)** i am going to make small documentary -----> videos !!!  as well.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 79828, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "arthanuse", "date": "2019-02-28 18:13:11", "content": "Suggestions for a First Camera /!/ Hello r/Cameras,\n\nI am looking for some advice on purchasing my first 'real' camera.  I am new to photography and videography that goes beyond the capabilities of a smart phone.  I enjoy making videos and love to take photos but the cell phone just doesn't work for what I want to make now.  For videos, it doesn't give me any depth in my scenes and has a lot of trouble staying focused on what I am doing, the low-light performance is also abysmal.  On the photo side I am frequently disappointed with how landscape shots look.  Landscapes are the most common subject I take photos of.  My smart phone is ideal for quick clips and taking snaps of people, however.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been looking at the current generation of enthusiast level cameras and don't know what to go with.  I am also not sure if a previous gen camera (new or used) will suit my needs.  My budget is firmly capped at $2000 CDN (incl. additional lens, taxes, etc...).  Video is likely to be the most common use for the camera I purchase so I want something that is quite capable, especially with HD content.  4k would be a wonderful bonus but not a necessity.  Low-light performance may be important as many of the videos will be of presenters in a dimly lit room with a bright slideshow in the background.

But I'm not so sure if it would in my situation. I do a lot of videos on speakers of any size and quality, from Floorstanding speakers to crappy 5.1 surround sound speakers.\n\nThe microphones built into my S9 are OK, but the bass that the microphones are capturing is completely overpowering the treble and vocals, especially when the satellite speakers are like 2 feet away from the bass module, making the recording sound awful. It's really a nuisance for me, because I care about how my recordings sound, and I'm worried that if I buy the Movo, and plug it into the mic preamp of my Galaxy S9, only to get the same result as with the built-in microphones, then it would be a waste of $40.\n\nThe issue I'm having here is the fact that the bass is killing the treble, so you can hardly hear it.

Not sure I'll be walking around at all with this thing, mostly on a tripod in one spot.  \n\u2022 The Sony A6600 has IBIS.. with a Sigma 16mm 1.4 is it hands down worth the $ over the A6400 or the...  \n\u2022 Panasonic G85 has been suggested. Not sure what lens I'd look at with it, and there is no continuous autofocus.\n  \nWhat are the thoughts? Any recommendations in this price range, or major players I should look at by bumping up a price range??  \n  \nFinale question- can either of these or suggestions made be utilized and streamed as a webcam for live courses?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/gd3ufx/creating_video_content_deciding_on_which_camera/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": false, "Selector": "creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "creating -----> video !!!  content - deciding on which camera to buy.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 3144, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "izralia", "date": "2020-05-04 00:26:44", "content": "What kind of camera should I use to record art timelapse videos? /!/ I\u2019m looking for something I can use to make art timelapse videos to post to sites like Instagram and YouTube, so obviously I would like the camera to take decent quality videos.

So I want to start by saying I\u2019m a graphic designer by trade but I\u2019ve recently been getting into photography/videography. Mostly product photo/videos for social media so like 10-15 seconds long. I\u2019ve been using my iPhone 8 to film some short social media clips but I\u2019ve been borrowing a Nikon d800 while taking a photography class and I love it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any going back now for me, and I also need a dslr/mirror less because I\u2019m taking classes at the local college next semester to make sure I know my stuff.

I will be making the videos using my desktop computer at home, with OBS Studio and Adobe Premiere Pro. I won't be making videos outside, so I only care about picture quality and suitability for recording video directly to a computer.\n\nI have a maximum budget of around $2,000 (Canadian dollars). Here are some features I'm looking  for:\n\n* The camera should be able to work directly from AC power (i.e. without using a battery) for long periods of time.\n* The camera should have a USB-C port supporting at least USB 3.1 Gen 1.\n* The camera should be able to send a 4K/30fps signal to the computer (without a time limit) either through USB or HDMI.\n* The camera should have an external microphone input and shoe.\n\nAfter doing some market research, I am thinking of buying the following equipment:\n\n* Fujifilm X-T30 camera (seems to have all the features I'm looking for, according to their website)\n* Elgato Cam Link 4K (but see below)\n* Deity V-Mic D3 Pro (to be mounted on the camera)\n* Neewer 2-Pack Dimmable 5600K USB LED Video Light (pretty cheap, but hopefully will do the job - I would buy better lights if I had a larger budget)\n\nTotal: $1,800 CAD. Note that I already have a green screen and two umbrella lights to use with it, which I bought previously for online lecturing, and will also be used for the YouTube videos.\n\nMy questions:\n* Is this a good setup for my purposes?\n* Am I missing some critical piece of equipment here? (For example, I assume I don't need an SD card since I'm recording directly to a computer, but maybe I'm assuming wrong...)\n* Will the Fujifilm X-T30 be able to work from AC power? (The specs say yes, but I wonder if there are any caveats. I previously considered a Canon mirrorless, but then I found out it requires not one but two expensive adapters to be able to use AC power.)\n* I know that most SLR/mirrorless cameras have webcam software, but it only works at abysmal resolutions such as 1024x576. However, my understanding is that this is due to these cameras having a slow USB 2.0 connection. Since the Fujifilm X-T30 has USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps), could it record in 4K with the Fujifilm webcam software? I could not find that information on their website. (If so, then it means I won't need the HDMI capture card.)\n\nRecommendations for alternative equipment, including other cameras in the same price range which have the features I want, would also be appreciated.

I'm looking for a camera for personal to semi-professional purposes in the budget of &lt;1800USD (including lens). However I have shot events and corporate AVs for local organizations and might take similar projects if they come my way. \n\nI know there's no perfect camera and it all really depends on what one wants out of it. In that light, seeing the kind of videos I've made in the past and how my style of shooting is, here are several details that might help you suggest -\n\n1. My usage of camera has been 60% video, 40% stills (out of which 70% street, 30% indoors).\n2. I have used hand-held a lot and even though I've taken pride in my rather still hands, I would love myself some good IBIS without the need for adding weight to my kit and pocket by investing in a gimbal.\n3. I love shooting conversations between people walking down the street as the camera leads them from front or follows them from behind. Like the conversations of Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpie walking on the streets in Linklater's Before trilogy. Ergo, I would love to have good AF capabilities. \n4. 4K60 is something I would want as it helps me a lot in my style of video-making. \n5. I'm not so hellbent on shooting 10bit from the camera. If I need it for a professional project, I can always rig an external recorder.\n6. Finally, I've always shot my projects with a FF lens setup like like a 24-105mm/F2.8 and a 50mm/F1.8. I think that range has more than sufficed for my work. Now considering my budget, I know getting a good FF camera might be difficult unless I go for a used one (which I want to avoid for reasons I won't get into). Which is why any lens/es that I can buy that will give me a similar range will do. ALSO, I'm not hellbent on the current ecosystem of whichever mount I buy having a wide range of lenses but would be extremely beneficial if the ecosystem is surely to eventually expand its lineup (native and third party) in the future (say 5-6 years).\n\nI know there already are plenty of similar posts but as you all know and can understand, everyone's hunt for a good camera is different. Which is why I'm making this post and I'm really sorry if it irks some of you, but I'm really hoping I can get some useful insights that might help me narrow down a camera I can get myself and work with.\n\nThanks!

I realise that the f1.4 lens on the LX10 lets in more light than the f2.8, but I was absolutely expecting the much bigger ASP-C sensor to make up for that. Out of interest though I set the LX10 to f2.8 and then it also selected ISO 800 and the resulting image was noisier &amp; less sharp than the X-T3.\n\n**please note** I dropped my LX10 and it now has a focusing issue left to right, **please compare the right hand side of the photos** which is in focus  \n**LX10** f1.4 1/60 ISO 200  \n[https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah8fRgFrVShdn\\_EE6LGBdYrsKni6eQ?e=06SRY0](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah8fRgFrVShdn_EE6LGBdYrsKni6eQ?e=06SRY0)  \n**X-T3** f2.8 1/60 ISO 800  \n[https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah8fRgFrVShdn\\_EF3-pou2hqUITSyA?e=ef1X2f](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah8fRgFrVShdn_EF3-pou2hqUITSyA?e=ef1X2f)  \n**LX10** f2.8 1/60 ISO 800  \n[https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah8fRgFrVShdn\\_EGxu87MMgr4H6FIg?e=2cWBRR](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah8fRgFrVShdn_EGxu87MMgr4H6FIg?e=2cWBRR)\n\nCan someone help me out please?

They sent me a generic 'try this, and if it doesn't work, submit it to be serviced'.  Well, they didn't watch the video (still has one view...me), it didn't work, and since it is out of warranty, service is about $200.  Has anybody seen this and have a resolution?  Given the way it crashes, I have a feeling it's bad RAM on the camera, and once the buffer reaches that spot on memory, it crashes.  I think this because if there is alot of activity on the camera, it will happen much sooner (about 3 minutes) than if it were still and pointed at the wall (11 minutes).  I get no thermal indicator, nor is warm when after it crashes, so that's not it.

I believe I saw this fix first on Reddit. There is a part that you can get 3d printed to fix the problem (see video). I looked at mine and indeed I had the problem. I ordered the part to be printed but ended up buy a bunch as there are minimum orders in the UK. I offer these on eBay (UK only) for cost of shipping as a service to the community. \n\nOne of my customers had a 645 Pro with the part, screw and spring missing. Mine had the spring missing. \n\nI think there are clearly unscrupulous sellers out there selling broken cameras or one they stripped of parts. The camera functions normally but may exhibit focusing problems. In my case I used it for years without noticing a problem. (What that says about my eyes I don't know!). \n\nAnyway, I would not buy a Mamiya 645 Pro/TL without seeing a photo of these parts in place.

(X-post from /r/Cameras.) /!/ [Where I'd like to mount.](https://imgur.com/a/ApTruiV)\n\nSorry for the low quality pictures. I don't have the boat home yet, and took these screenshots from a video walkthrough I made.\n\nMy intent for mounting a camera on the bow is to do 360 time lapses of traveling under way, with focus on the waves, other boats, and of course the shoreline and horizons.\n\nI have a GoPro Fusion.\n\nCurrently I have a bike mount which will allow me to take decent video, but while I took spherical shots from this same spot on the test drive, I wasn't really happy with the shot. I'd really like to get something more birds eye.\n\nI've been unable to find something purpose built.\n\nMy ideal height would be 20 feet above the dec, this would put the camera right above the fly bridge. It would also be nice if I could angle it out, and capture video from ahead of the boat.\n\nThe min requirements I have are ...\n\n1.Be strong. Winds will reach 30 knots regularly, 40 at most if we're not mindful. The waves will reach up to 8 feet, and it will be rocked, a lot.\n\n2. Be compact. It has to go up relatively easy, and come down real easy, while not taking up too much storage space.\n\n3. Be mark free. I don't want to scuff the rails or decking, teak. I'm unwilling to drill in to the boat for this.\n\n4. If possible, something hollow so I can run a cable through it, to attach a power pack down at the base for extended trips, which could be 6+ hours.\n\nI've had several ideas, but find fault in all of them.\n\n1. A flag pole. It's strong enough, but anything that can be taken down is not. Also, it would be extremely difficult to mount.\n\n2. A boat hook. I'd chop the hook off and attach a camera mount. However they're too short at 12'.\n\n3. A custom PVC pipe build. I'd get 5 sections of 4' long pipe, put screw ends on them, and try to come up with a way to mount it to the rails. However I wouldn't trust the materials not to snap under the roll of waves and the winds.\n\nWhat would you do if you wanted this shot? Assume budget isn't a key factor, but I'd like to stay under $250 if at all possible.\n\nThank you.\n\nP.S.\n\nI'm thinking whatever I do, I would want struts attaching it to several of the vertical, and horizontal, rails. I could come up with metal rods with clamps fairly easily, and slapping 6 or 8 on there would help with security down below ... but I don't want it to snap at the mid section or up high.

I love photography but all I've ever used so far is my phone and my ancient Nikon Coolpix that works slightly worse than my phone. After doing some research I think I'm going to go with a canon camera, but I haven't decided on which one, and I'd love to hear some advice.\n\nWhat I would want to photograph is pretty all over the place. I love taking photos of landscapes and the outdoors, macro photography of plants and bugs, food (I'm a baker,) portraits, and just cool things I see on the street. I have never made any videos but I absolutely would if I had a camera that could do it-- I think it would be a lot of fun to get into vlogging. However, it's not my priority.\n\nMy budget is about $2000, which both is and is not a lot of money when it comes to camera equipment. The general wisdom on here seems to be spend half of your budget on lenses, and I think that would make sense to me since my interests are pretty varied. The lens I think I'm interested in are the EF-S 24mm f/28 STM lens, the EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM, the thrifty fifty, and possibly the EF 100m f/2.8 Macro USM lens (especially if I end up with a less expensive camera).\n\nTwo that I have considered are the Canon 80D, but it seems like that one is geared more towards videographers than photographers, when I would definitely be taking more photos than videos. The other one that I've considered is the rebel sl3; the price is great so I would have more money left over for lenses, but it seems really tiny and top heavy, and when I made a search on this subreddit the comments weren't very positive.\n\nI don't have a lot of experience but I am pretty tech savvy and I love watching tutorials, so I don't feel the special need to get something designed to be uncomplicated for beginners. I'm proficient in photoshop and lightroom.\n\nThanks to anyone who got through all of that! I don't mean to be one of those people that shows up randomly demanding everyone else do the work of choosing a camera for them, but any advice would be great, and let me know if there's more info I can add.\n\nEdited to add: I am a little rough on objects (working on this) so something on the sturdier side appeals to me.

Cropped video\n2. No 120fps\n3. Limited 24fps\n4. No IBIS (big issue)\n\nI\u2019ve also been looking at the R6 as the R5 is too much for me at this point. The R6 might be within reach. \n\nSo, do you think I should go with the R or RP and mount it to a DJI Ronin gimbal, or avoid them and save for the R6? Should I just keep shooting with my GoPro because it shoot all frame rates I need???\nI have $1,600 CDN saved so far specifically for camera gear. But could use other money too. I know I am a long way from the $3,200 for the R6 plus the glass for a 24-70mm. \n\nThanks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/kjk9ak/mirrorless_upgrade/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": false, "Selector": "i have been making", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i have been making -----> videos !!!  for awhile with the gopro, and i am starting to get business from that.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 47682, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "lepydas", "date": "2020-05-12 13:12:53", "content": "Hi everyone, I made a video on my thoughts about the EOS R5 if you'd like to give it a watch.

Went 350D&gt;40D&gt;5D&gt;5D2. Lens lineup: 17-40, 50/f1.8, 24-70, 70-300. Come into some inheritance, combined with upcoming 30th birthday. Will be buying a house soon and so this is the last opportunity I will have for probably 15 years to spend a bit of money on my hobby.\n\nI have yearned for the 5D4 ever since it came out. I'll never afford one new, but a decent one can be had secondhand for around \u00a31400.\n\nOne thing I've wanted from my 5D2 is better autofocus, SD card slots, touchscreen, better low light performance, better dynamic range, better video creation. In reality, I know that the 5D2 is still a more than capable camera and I am probably not using it to its full potential.\n\nThat said, I don't want to go backwards. Image quality is the primary concern, and while the 6D2 has a tonne of features... its sensor looks to be a bit lacking.\n\nI can easily afford the 6D2, but I am concerned that it would feel like a step backward and I'd be kicking myself for not stumping up a few hundred extra to get the 5D4.\n\nEnter scene: EOS R.\n\nI've not looked much at mirrorless... but it looks like it's the way of the future. Sensor-wise, it looks like a 5D4 in a compact body. It's lighter, has some of the features of the 6D2 (the articulating screen, which is sexy-af). I'm not sure about the EVF, but honestly I think I'll get used to it. I use live view a lot anyway. I'm concerned about battery life, but with all the old batteries on my 5Dmk2 I carry around I could probably just get a bunch of spares anyway.\n\nI'm at a bit of a crossroads here, and some first-person perspectives from people who have made the jump from either the 5D2 to the EOS R or the 5D4 would be appreciated. I'm erring towards the EOS R if funds will allow as the smaller size will be good for my camera bag.\n\nUpdate edit: It's come to light that the majority of you have recommended that the R is the right call. Ultimately I know I will be happy with either, and I will keep my eyes peeled for a well-priced 5d4 just in case, but I'll now get on the hunt for a decent R.

I have been torn between a few choices and was hoping to get your inputs or considerations! I currently have a Rebel T2i with the kit lens and an EF-S 55-250 f/4-5.6 IS. \n\n**Reason to Upgrade:** I am photographing portraits and action shots for fitness, as well as workout vlogs and videos, promotional videos for trainers, supplements, gyms, etc. I am also a passionate photographer and I love taking landscape photography as well as making travel videos. I will also be dabbling in real estate photography as my skillset continues to improve. Below are some of the things I feel like my camera is lacking and reasons why I'm thinking about upgrading:\n\n* Need better low-light capabilities - especially inside \n* Need better (and faster) AF\n* Articulating screen \n* Would like to use mirrorless full frame sensors\n* Want more MP so I can make larger prints (for my office and training studios)\n* Want to future-proof my camera for 3-5 years but maintain the RF glass system as it is getting better and better\n* Video capabilities (I really wished for Full HD @ 120p but since most of the slow-motion videos will be for IG or YT, the HD resolution will be OK)\n\nI have looked at the Sony A7iii but have recently opted against it due to its handheld feel, menu, and new lens system. I did like the raw camera specs (esp the FHD 120p video capabilities) and the AF. If I wasn't so stubborn about Canon there wouldn't be a discussion.\n\nI have been looking at upgrading to the EOS R after researching for the last 3 or so months, but now am having a hard time between the R and the R6. One of the things I like about the EOS R is the 30MP sensor, but I like the video capabilities of the R6. I will be doing more photography than videos, so I've been leaning more towards the R, unless the R6 is a significant upgrade.\n\nMy ideal camera would be the EOS R with the RF 24-105 f/4 USM lens, but I've also looked at the EOS R6 with the RF 24-105 f/4-7.1 STM lens. I have  read some rumors (from pre-covid) about a possible successor to the EOS R (such as a mark II) but it seems like that has not been Canon's primary plans anymore. I would love to have the FHD 120p!\n\n**Budget: $3000 - $3500 (pretty tight on this range, but would explore a little higher if it's worth the investment). I am not in an immediate rush to upgrade, but would like to upgrade between now and 2021.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Thinking about the EOS R w/ RF 24-105 f/4 USM and would like to hear some options or ideas!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/j3kt19/advicerecommendations_on_camera_upgrade_eos_r_or/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": false, "Selector": "i can make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "so i can make larger prints (for my office and training studios)\n* want to future-proof my camera for 3-5 years but maintain the rf glass system as it is getting better and better\n* -----> video !!!  capabilities (i really wished for full hd @ 120p but since most of the slow-motion videos will be for ig or yt, the hd resolution will be ok)\n\ni have looked at the sony a7iii but have recently opted against it due to its handheld feel, menu, and new lens system.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 49474, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "TheRamiRocketMan", "date": "2020-10-26 08:04:46", "content": "Good options for improving night video on a Canon 800D /!/ Hi all,\n\nI've been making videos on my phone for a while but on a friend's recommendation I picked up a Canon 800D for nature filming and photography.

When you take action and just do it, then you will be one step closer to where you need to be.\n\nYes it can mean that you work hard with no pay, rejections and stress. but know you have that much more experience on what works and what doesn't.\n\n### \"It all starts in the mind and then reflects out through your action, your outer reflection is your inner reflection.\"\n\nIf you believe and have faith in yourself, in what you really want out of life, then take action even if it doesn't make sense, you will start to notice things just automatically working out for you, new opportunities will be coming towards you.\n\n**YOU CAN TAKE ACTION ANYWHERE YOU ARE!**\n\nFeeling down depressed, lonely, cannot leave the house?

Nothing crazy, but transfers and exports, combined with a bunch of small card drops, *makes LR a slow boy*.\n\nIt's not 20k photos a day or something either. LR just really has a slight edge in a test tube for projects like this over something like Capture One. But damn, I'm itching like crazy to 100% drop LR.\n\n*And I'll be honest, part of it is habit.* Yesterday I had a colleague offer to help process on his laptop and I accepted his help, because I was sleep deprived from a busy first day. And in the mix, a few cards got mixed up. It was only 2 cards, but you can easily end up with 3x copies of photos in the same location by just running a card through my import process. In LR I have the fix to that down to every keystroke needed with zero extra requirements. And at no risk of deleting anything, but duplicates.\n\nSo when I'm waiting for uploads or exports, when things are going as planned, LR basically turns into \"Not Responding, because you touched a menu button.\" Sometimes I search for people's tricks.

I was going to publish it to /r/dataisbeautiful, but I'm beat. And I sure wont be able to post it there at 9:17am for that juicy Karma train. So enjoy! I might make a video and post, but only time will tell. I'm slammed here out of state, and the second I get home, have to roll right into some high end architecture work.\n\nAnyone remember my processing post with 9 bracketed photos and SNS? Sorry I delete my posts and comments sometimes. It helps me get back on track and focused on work, I also apply for jobs and don't want any paper trail online to stuff that might be troublesome.\n\nTo anyone who thinks it's bad to share this stuff, because someone can hop in and take mah business! Be my guest haha. It's mostly a job for people who enjoy file management structures And limited sleep. Not high pay. My first day started at 6am  on Monday and I didn't sleep the entire first night, then worked until 2am the next night, with few breaks. I got 4 hours of sleep last night, and shared a drink with some nice peeps, last night, and went right back in at 7am. (I don't like stopping until I know everything is 100% ready to deliver the second I leave - This job was an extreme example though. The first day had dozens of tiny changes, interruptions, needing to stop a job backing up and processing to get 4 random photos for XYZ - yada yada).\n\nWhen the system works, I will admit, it's really fun for me. And I still have a lot to learn.\n\nI'm wrapping up soon, but this post was a good 10 minute breather for me (I like to downplay how long it takes me to write a post like this, to get a few extra minutes of rest!!!), I hope you enjoy the joke and flow chart. I won't lie, I might not be responding to too many questions here, asap, hopefully others who know this stuff can chime in. The photo mechanic stuff is a little complicated at first. I'll try to followup sooner than later.\n\n*Quick note for anyone who thinks smugmug sucks, or LR isn't needed for XYZ! I'm on the same page! There's plenty of reasons why something else is better, but budget aren't always unlimited, and the smugmug is my client's setup, I'm just delivering to their spec. It actually handles jobs like this really well. with duplicate blocking and tertiary organization.\n\nAnd I don't promote any of the software shared or discussed. You can easily put Capture One or something like Google Drive in place of other stuff in there.\n\nNight!

I want to become more professional, but my work / website is all over the place, help? /!/ Hello guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name is Wahid, 23 years old. I've been doing photography for a bit over 3.5 years now. I've shot all kinds of things, as is normal when you first start out I suppose. I think my strength lies in portraiture and landscapes / nature. I've shot a few weddings and have more planned, people ask me for portrait sessions / family portraits and recently I've actually gotten a job as a full time photographer / videographer at the company where I did my bachelor graduation project (not photography related, it's product design). This full time job that I got there isn't permanent unfortunately. I'm at a point with my skills where I'm happy with the results and I think it's worth paying for.\n\n  \nI know that photography is my passion, I love it 10 times more than product design. Photography gives me energy, product design costs me energy. so I want to persue a career in photography.  \n\nI'm just wondering what way to go, how to do it. I feel like I need to specialize, but my website is all over the place.  \nYou can have a look [here](https://www.wahidfayumzadah.com/) if you want, feel free to judge. It is in Dutch, but I think the navigation speaks for itself. \n\nOn my website what you'll find a lot is portraits / wedding photography, that's what gets me money at the moment, my landscape photos I haven't found a way yet to make money with.  \n\nAt the moment I'm thinking of going more towards the corporate side, to have other firms / companies as my clients.   \nAt the full time photography job that I have right now I do a lot of product photography, I photograph the work activities, the staff and I make product video's, company / corporate video. Unfortunately I haven't updated my website with that work yet because it feels like a completley different branch and my website would be even more all over the place.  \n\nI've shared here more or less where my photography stands at, at this moment. \n\nWhat I really want to hear or get out of this post is advice on how to become more professional or how to actually make a living out of this. I'm still living at my parents' place, so the money pressure or whatever isn't very high.\n\nI think that I'm just (subjectively) good / ok at photography and I really suck at the business side of things.   \nIs it maybe better to just start reading books about entrepreneurship? Is the problem maybe not so much my website? Is it all about networking and do I need to be sending out hundreds of emails everyday? I guess I should be reaching out way more to potential clients, which I'm at the moment not really doing, also because of the current job.\n\nI know that this is a tricky subject and there isn't just one answer, but yeah... maybe you guys have advice for me, pointers or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ap3zyy/how_to_specialize_i_want_to_become_more/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": false, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i do a lot of product photography, i photograph the work activities, the staff and i make product -----> video !!!

I\u2019m a digital artist and I want to make videos of me creating my art and take flatlay photos for my social media. I\u2019ve created a setup at my desk where I have both my ring light and camera rig clamped to the back of my desk so that I can get overhead shots/video. I was excited to start filming and taking pictures yesterday but my screen is overexposed and blown out so that you can\u2019t see what\u2019s on it if I\u2019m using white canvas. I adjusted the f-stop but when I do that, the background becomes dull... is there anything I can do with my lighting or camera settings so that my tabletop background is vivid and bright but you can also see my iPad screen clearly? I\u2019m also using an anti-glare screen protector on my iPad. \n\nHope all of this makes sense. I\u2019m completely new to photography and videography.
