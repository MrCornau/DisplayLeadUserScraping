Now, I'm aware that using these things isnt as easy as point and shoot (one of my ex's did photography in school, I tagged along for most of her photography expeditions). I have a vague understanding of different things to take into account (like exposure), but it's not like I took the class or anything.\n\nMostly what I planned on doing was setting everything to a neutral setting, then taking notes on what changes I made for each picture, then comparing them whenever I got the roll developed. Is this a reasonable approach? \n\nWhen I first received the camera, I took it into a camera shop to get it looked at, and the guy told me it had a light leak issue and would cost about $200 to fix. I declined, wasnt in my budget, but I did a little reading on lightleak and saw that it could be anywhere from a minor part of the film getting exposed or it could completely expose the film and ruin any chance of getting pictures at all. I still want to move forward with trying this, but it is just totally not worth it?\n\nLastly, can I just buy any old film on the internet? There are some multi packs on amazon going for about twenty five bucks and I was probably going to get one of those.\n\nI'm really just winging this out of boredom, not expecting any professional shots or anything.

I think I'll just stick to scanning and let the professionals develop from here on out. I recently bought a Cinestill powder kit for color film developing, a Patterson Tank, and a dark bag. The Cinestill kit came with instructions on developing times, the whole jazz, measurements, what to mix together all of that. I developed two rolls of Porta 400 (36exp. some I extra pissed) with the kit and I am starting to think Cinestill's chemicals are just shit. Because I did everything correctly so I thought. It's not easy to pin point where I might've screwed up at, but once I finished the required time for the blix to be put into the tank, I added the final rinse image stabilizer. I left my film in the tank after I agitated it with the final rinse just to be sure the images would come out crisp. An hour pasts and I take the film out and let it blow dry with a fan. Once it's dry I load the film onto my Epson Scanner. Once I got into LR and Negative Lab Pro and make tiff scans of everything my images still had emissions on them.

I got some great feedback and suggestions from you folks. I also wanted to let you know how it went.\n\nSo, we do classes in digital photography, but this was the first time we did a film class in close to a decade. I had seen so many people, in the past six months, take up film that I decided we needed to run one.\n\nThe class ranged in ages from 10-76. We had a pretty good turn out. I had a table full of my cameras and photos. The first half was a powerpoint demonstration. Talking about the history of film, the beauty of film, and practical tips for taking photos. \n\nWe then moved into the studio, and the students took turns posing, setting lights, and running through examples with aperture and shutter speed. (Best thing I did was take a few hundred photos, and throw them in the air, having the students shoot it at a low shutter speed and a fast shutter speed).\n\nAfter class I handed out old expired rolls of film, and everyone dropped off their film for me to develop the next day.\n\nHere's the part that warmed my heart. The youngest in the class, a ten year old kid named Robert (who has the camera bug bad) stole the show. Asked great questions. Was incredibly enthused. He's shooting with an Olympus with no light meter. His rolls before the class were pretty bad...the roll he dropped off the weekend after the class? All great shots! He even bought me a book on photography and told me \"I think you're going to like this book. Thank you so much for your class\".\n\nAnyways, long and rambling, but you guys came through with some great suggestions and realy helped to make my class work.

I am a 20 years old guy, who moved from Ukraine to Poland in order to study. \n\nWhen i was in school (in 10 class or so) i started to do journalism. I wrote some arcticles about music in my social page (and then turned out they are good), and than wrote to one journal about hip-hop and started working in it. I visited some concerts as a press. And once i went for a 7 days music event. I wanted to make some content for my journal, so i took my dad's camera (nikon d5100 kit) and rolled. I cant say how i liked making photos. I didnt feel that alive for my hole life. And i started learning things about photo. \n\nSo, as i said, after my school i left to Poland to study. I still prefered my journalism 'hobby' over photo, i thought it will be more realistic to be a good journalist than a good photography guy for me. Turned out, that i can choose 'press and photography' and i was ducking happy. I'm on my 3 year now.\n\nFor this time, i've been learning photo a lot. I know pretty much about all photography theory stuff. I worked as a photographer in a tour company. We visited Europes cities and i was taking photos of people who were with this tour comp. But it was only 1 day per week. Salary was good - almost 50$ per day (i would mention, that its pretty good for poland, here on average work u get 4$ per hour. And i worked only 2 hours while that people had an excursion). But i couldnt live on 200$/month.  \n\nAlso, i managed to do photo sessions several times, just answering people who wrote in social medias that they are searching for photographer. But it was really rare (3 or 4 times over 2 years).\n\nCurrently, Im working on an average work so i can pay my rent, bills, food etc. But i dont want to work here. I cant find a work in photo-industry either. There are ONLY TWO work ads right now. Both from gigant firms, that wont even see my portoflio in those hundreds portfolios. \n\n  \nAlso im still visiting some concerts as a photographer, but i do it for free. Just to listen some music i like and to do some shots for my portfo.    \n\n\nI want to get money and do photography, but i just cant find those tip to get into industry. In future, Im pretty sure i want to do business and open my photostudio, but i dont have enough money for now. Im pretty suffering because of it. I dont even know whether my photos are good or no. \n\nRight now im trying to win some contests. First i found Gurushots. I tried it and than understood, that 90% photos there are trash (*thats not about quality of photos - there are porn photos from someone's home archives, screenshots from movies lol, and etc*). Then i found Shuttout. This page seems leggit, but i still dont even know should i try 'paid entry' and will i have any chances to win some money with it or i'll just waste my money.\n\nI would even do someones post-production as retouching or etc, but i dont know where am i supposed to search.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is: how can i make money with photography on my level?

I now have nothing but respect for them. /!/ So the post in question was simply a comment:\n\n\"If cooking youtube was like photography youtube it would be mostly oven reviews.\"\n\nIt got over 2800 upvotes, 8 awards and 263 comments.\n\nThe only one of those comments that stuck with me was a very simple one 'Be the change you want to see in the world.' It's very very easy to criticise from the sidelines while not doing anything to help the situation yourself. So as someone who's wanted to make videos for a while I thought it was only fair i gave it a go my self and **it's a lot harder than it looks**, Not only on a technical level but emotionally too.\n\nThe first thing is the technical side is difficult. As someone coming at this from photography I had an advantage over most other new youtubers but setting up lighting for video is still hard. Creating shots for B roll is difficult and time consuming, editing is very easy to get lost in, even on only a 5 minute video. Then recording and mixing sound is an entirely new skillset I had to learn about which is just as large as video and arguably more important.\n\nThe difficulties in trying to get it to look and sound nice were nothing compared to the real hard part though, which for me was presenting. Delivering some lines straight to camera is something that seems to be so easy, because everyday we look at people who seem to do it effortlessly. The first time I tried to speak to camera I only lasted 3 words before I stuttered. I can't be the only one who struggles with this, whenever I look at small or even big youtubers their videos are filled with jump cuts. It took a lot of practice simply to get all the lines right for 10 uninterrupted seconds, that's before I can even think about getting those lines to sound interesting and engaging, rather than a monotonous drone.\n\nFinally there's the psychological aspect of seeing and hearing yourself on camera and putting yourself out there. I'm not a self conscious guy, but something about seeing yourself on a screen in High definition has you doubting everything about your appearance: Is my skin too spotty? Is my hair a mess (yes)? Are my teeth too British? Then we come to the voice, I don't have the best one to begin with but it took me a month to get the point where I could hear it played back without spending an entire minute cringing. I'd spend hours searching for \"How make your voice sound deeper/clearer/less monotone\" before realizing there's nothing I can really do with EQ, I have to accept that's just my voice.\n\nConsidering how much time most of us spend watching youtube videos making one yourself is an experience I'd recommend everyone to try even if you don't publish it. Even making one that looks bad and amateurish like I did is hard, consistently putting out good content on any subject is very impressive and getting to the point where you have extremely engaging videos with production values rivalling most TV shows in unbelievable.\n\nWhatever level they're at and whatever field they're in, someone putting themselves out there to be judged deserves to be respected.\n\n[So here's my shoddy atempt for those interested.](https://youtu.be/eU1xzznq_3Y)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/kttc53/so_after_one_of_last_years_top_posts_comparing/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": false, "Selector": "creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "creating shots for b -----> roll !!!  is difficult and time consuming, editing is very easy to get lost in, even on only a 5 minute video.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4124, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Rayleigh-Benard", "date": "2021-04-05 20:47:46", "content": "35mm film reversal second exposure HELP NEEDED /!/ Hey.

I can\u2019t seem to find a small quantity of stabilizer to buy, only bulk chemicals that make like fifty gallons.

I\u2019ve also heard that it stinks like formaldehyde and needs to be used in a well ventilated area, which sort of turns me off. \n\nI\u2019m tempted to just develop these last twelve rolls without using stabilizer.

Although, I\u2019m not entirely sure what happens without a stabilizer. \n\nSo, have any of you ever developed C41 without using a stabilizer?  Or have any of you mixed up your own?

I had stored the chemicals in a complete;y black bottles with all dirt squeezed out and in refrigerator. So, until February 2020 I had developed 7 or 8 rolls of film (Fuji Superia HQ 200, Xtra 400, Fujicolor 200 &amp; Ultramax 400) in this mix until now. \n\nThe developer had turned from light yellowish to pink color now. I guess that from the film dye though I give them a prewash, mainly the fuji films. I tried a film strip test and the results are shown in picture below: 1- Film cut from roll, 2- Dropped in developer, 3- Dropped in Blix. I noticed there are some particles in the developer. Does it mean it's bad? Can I just vacuum filter it to remove the particles and keep using it? My Blix though seems to have no floating particles and is brownish red color. What is the longest duration you guys have used and store a C-41 kit? Oh and one thing I noticed is with a 4 piece of strip was that after dropping in developer for 4 mins and then in blix for 6.5 mins the film turned out green. I assume this is because the strip got exposed to light completely?\n\nSince C-41 kits have started becoming pricey  don't just want to throw it away if it's good. I might use this batch of chemicals only for non-important rolls since I wouldn't need to worry a lot in case something goes seriously wrong. What do you guys think?

It just occured to me to test both shutters and meters together to see if I could find any noticeable differences. I've already used my first OM2n to shoot and process a few rolls of color negative film. The results came out stunningly on both Fujicolor C200 and Kodak Gold 200.

I've heard alkaline batteries can cause incorrect metering, so I changed the battery to the same spare silver oxide 303/357/76 batteries as my 1st camera. The meters still vary the same amount. Supposedly both were tested for shutter and metering. Could they have different metering screen? (I don't think so for this model?) Is one meter bad? Is there another explanation?

I'm relatively new to analog photography (started using non-point-n-shoots in May) and would like some help addressing some exposure issues.\n\nI've developed a few rolls on my SLR + 35mm lens and have noticed that the photos are consistently extremely grainy / underexposed when shooting in Aperture Priority. When it happened on my first roll I chalked it up to being user error, but I recently took photos of the same subject with my Olympus XA (also shoots in AP and has 35mm focal length), and it's clear to me that there's something up with the internal metering. The internal metering of the SLR is supposed to account for center (higher weight) as well as the background (lower weight) and is called 'Multiple Field Metering' in the manual.  \n\nHere's a comparison. I included some egregious errors and some that are salvageable.

Not relying on the internal meter at all and instead using a phone / dedicated light meter? Doing a test roll and bracketing different shutter speeds, starting from the one suggested by internal meter? If it suggests 1/250, try 1/125, 1/60, &amp; 1/30?

I am planning on developing c41 rolls myself since it is shockingly expensive to do it elsewhere. For the price of 1 roll developed, I can buy 3 36exposure rolls of Kodak gold.\n\nBut I also read that c41 powder chems expire very quickly after mixing. People try to squeeze out air and store in fridges but that only stretch it to maybe about 6 months. I'm trying to get maybe 30 rolls out of a cine still powder 1 liter pack, so I would need to shoot and develop 5 rolls a month to not \"waste\" the developer.\n\nI do not plan on shooting more than a roll or 2 a month, so this a problem. But could I just develop 1 roll at a time and thus only mix half of the powder (.5 liter)? That way even after the first half of the developer expired, I can still mix together the rest of the powder for a new batch.\n\nI do not care about the inconvenience of basically getting 1 roll developed when I could have done 2 at the same time. I plan on trying to see what I shot soon after finishing rolls anyways so i would likely not have a bunch of rolls lying around.\n\nDoes this seem like a stupid idea? It make a lot of sense to me but I have not read it anywhere.\n\nTLDR: Can I develop 1 roll of c41 at a time with a half liter of c41 chems? Goal is to mix the other half of the powder when the 1st half expire so I essentially get twice the shelf life at the cost of inconvenience from developing a max of 1 roll at a time.

Because it's been really sunny the last few days I was having to use the faster shutter speeds to expose it properly, but when I developed the roll, all but one shot came up blank (the negatives were clear). For that one good shot I believe I was using a shutter speed of 1/250. \n\nI got to figuring out what was wrong and found that for shutter speeds faster than 1/125, the shutter curtain would rarely open (1/125 would open somewhat reliably with diminishing success for faster speeds).

Testing the battery voltages, both batteries delivered the rated 6V, but I couldn't test the current.

Earlier today I decided to have a crack at developing my colour rolls (Kodak Colourfast 200)\n\nI've been doing weeks of research on it, watching various YouTube tutorials and other guides on Reddit etc. On the exact process, what mistakes to watch for, essentially everything I could find on the subject of developing colour negatives at home. \n\n\nOne of the issues I had with my B/W roll was several pictures being very grey and lacking contrast, which I've attributed to underdevelopment since the same thing happened across different exposures on both rolls, so I made sure to make note of the correct volumes I'd need; and used a sous vide temperature regulator to maintain the correct temperature for each stage of the process, as well as making sure to use distilled water for each mix to ensure everything was as pure as I could get it. (I live in Wales so the water is pretty alright, but it has been very cloudy coming from the tap so this was just an extra precaution)\n\nAside from that I followed, pretty much to the letter, the development guide written in the booklet that came with the Tetenal C41 Dev kit. Making sure to keep track of the various timings and do it all with minimal mess and mistakes as I possibly could, until finally completing the process and getting ready to hang my film up. \n\nThis is what I don't get: \n\nI know for a fact that I shot both rolls to completion, within the same area during a two week period, and developed them at the same time, making sure to note the volume, temperature, and duration required to develop two rolls (the max capacity of my dev tank) but somehow, the roll that was at the top of the tank has come out entirely blank while the roll that was at the bottom seems to have developed correctly. I would've assumed that any errors I'd made would've been apparent on both rolls, and if I hadn't shot the film myself I would've assumed it was blank to start with, so I'm not sure how this has happened or how to avoid it happening again. \n\nI really love shooting film and with winter approaching I'm very excited to get my hands on some CineStill 800T to get some decent photos in low light, but I'd rather know exactly how I messed up these 'test' rolls first before moving onto more expensive stocks. \n\nIf you made it this far thanks for at least reading through my woes and any help or guidance I could get here would be immensely appreciated.

Shot about 5 rolls now. It\u2019s been really fun, and I really enjoy it! There\u2019s been some hiccups along the way though, and I wanted to share and figured here was probably the best place. Nothing particularly illuminating or helpful, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re here for, but I think sharing your struggles can be beneficial sometimes. This is pretty lengthy.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing digital photography for a few years now, nothing professional, just a hobby. I recently fell in love with film and decided I wanted to give it a try. First roll I shot was Portra 400 (shocker!) and I had a great time doing it! Took my friend out and we took some great shots. At least, that\u2019s what I thought.\n\nI send the roll off (The Darkroom in California) and continue shooting in the meantime. I get the scans back, but there\u2019s only 5 photos. Super confused for a hot minute, and I\u2019m finally like, I guess the rest are being uploaded...? So I take a look at the photos, and to my great dismay, they\u2019re all half-exposed. All five of em. Again, I\u2019m brand new, so my first thought was something happened in the lab. Maybe they messed up, or I filled out the order form wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ve2cmz6k16861.jpg?width=1545&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5398b4e7cb9074ce58db25dab21cc6a8c2aa6ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kzgufqm16861.jpg?width=1545&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cc11604b921603cdedb550597c91c0690eacc7\n\nI quickly realized that, no, it\u2019s gotta be my camera. So I email The Darkroom, and ask if they know what might have happened with my camera. They kindly reply and tell me it was most likely a shutter lag issue. Ok, makes sense. I investigate my camera, open the back, and Yep, the shutter curtain is halfway advanced. The edge is sittin\u2019 right down the middle. This sucks, but at least now I know. I manage to fix the shutter (probably not the correct way). The next roll I shoot, I make sure the shutter\u2019s good, and all is well (I\u2019m hoping!).\n\nToday, I went out with my friend again to shoot. All went great, got some great shots (I thought.) After I take the last shot, we\u2019re talking, and I go to rewind. I pull the lever, and start rewinding. This is where I messed up \u2014 didn\u2019t press the rewind button :).. I feel a little bit of resistance, more than usual, but I\u2019m not really paying much attention, and just keep going. And something gives. Again, not really paying attention, but I know in my gut that wasn\u2019t good. Once I get home, I know I gotta see what\u2019s up, so I go in my closet, totally dark, and open the back to see if the film actually advanced. It did not! I can still feel it. I let in a liiiitle but of light, knowing these few frames are gone, but I literally can\u2019t see anything. I look, and the film is still wrapped all the way around. And it\u2019s completely detached from the canister. They\u2019re not touching. I pick the canister up, and feel the end of the film, which is torn. Great. I figure I can save some of it if I just feed it back into the canister, so I pry open the edge slightly and start to feed it in there, little by little, trying my best not to smudge it to hell. After several frames are in, I place it back in the camera, close it, make sure I press the rewind button, and slowly wind it back.\n\nThe roll\u2019s sitting in a mailer right now, I plan to ship it tomorrow. There\u2019s really nothing else I can do. Maybe it\u2019s all ruined and I\u2019ll get back 24 black squares. We\u2019ll see.\n\nThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at in my analog journey.

I am converting all the prices to approximate USD amount, but I do not live in US. I do not have a DLSR to use DLSR scanning, nor I do have Lightroom (or am willing to pay for it, since I kinda dislike Adobe's subscription model) to use NLP.\n\nOptions I kinda have:\n-\tUsed Epson V550 for approximately 200 USD\n-\tUsed Plustek 8100 for 240 USD\n-\tNew 8100 for approximately 330 USD (if I won't be able to get the used Plustek)\n-\tNew 8200i SE for 420 USD\n-\tNew 8200i AI for 560 USD\n\nI am only planning to scan 35mm negatives, and primarily only freshly developed ones (so they should not have too much dust/scratches, hopefully - which seems like the 8200 benefit of dust/scratch removal should not be that beneficial?). Also, is there any difference between the SE and AI apart from the bundled software?\n\nAs for the different options - I did some research, and have read several posts that the Epson V550 is not ideal for scanning 35mm? Like, that it has focusing issues, unless you get the ANR glass adapters (which would be extra money, especially incl. shipping and custom fees/taxes to Europe) and it would put it on par with the used Plustek 8100.\n\nCurrently, I am getting the scans from the lab that develops them, but the quality is not great, especially when comparing them to some stuff people post on r/Analog or so from 35mm film). Some examples of the scans are in this imgur album (I hope it won't screw up the uncompressed TIFF) https://imgur.com/a/JwlBWtP - it might be just bad photos or so (e.g. the ducks are not perfectly focused), but I think the scans could be way better in general.\n\nThe 10x15 quality scan costs 4 USD (those are the ones in the album), and the \"better\" scan is around 9 USD (never tried that one yet). They also sometimes screw up the scan and some photos are cut off and reach into the next frame (happened on 2 rolls out of 7 I developed/scanned there).\n\nI usually shoot like 1 to 2 rolls a month, so the yearly saving would be between 60 to 135 USD (if I consider I would get scans that are better, so the more pricey ones) - which brings me to the biggest issue in this - ROI, which makes me feel that the 8200i AI is not worth it at all for me. However, having own scanner means I could scan some of the old negatives that my parents have with childhood photos etc., which is not a bad thing for sure, and would kinda bring the ROI down.\n\nIf somehow can show me e.g. the results they get with V550 with the stock holders that would be greatly appreciated, at least to excludie it from the decision process. Also, if someone has hands-on experience with V550 vs the Plustek 8100 (or 8200), that would be great help as well. Also scans from the Plustek scanners (to see the quality you can get from 35mm neg) would be helpful. And especially comparsion of the same negative on both scanners, but I doubt anyone has access to both scanners at the same time.\n\nThanks for any sample scans, or advices in general!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/kmigho/scanner_advice_for_scanning_at_home/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "they also sometimes screw up the scan and some photos are cut off and reach into the next frame (happened on 2 -----> rolls !!!  out of 7 i developed/scanned there).", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 52954, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "jebthepleb", "date": "2020-12-29 15:05:09", "content": "Help!

Here we go!)*\n\nBeen shooting film for 5 years now as a small hobby. Not a very good photographer even, I just have fun with it. Beginning of this year I had the trip of a lifetime to Japan and obviously took my camera to shoot away. I bought 4 rolls when I got there (from an electronics store in Shibuya that had an AMAZING selection of current film, and some rarities including Ektachrome). One of the 4 I had used all around Hakone until I got to what I *thought* was the end of the roll, only to realise I had I hadn\u2019t loaded it properly and it hadn't taken to the notches. Therefore had no idea how far it was moving forward after I cocked it, or if it was even moving at all. I tried to get to the end to see if had maybe taken a bunch of overlapping frames that were salvageable, but it didn\u2019t seem to end so I assumed that it hadn't taken at all and was therefore unsavable so rolled it back into the cartridge and moved on. I did get it developed and there was nothing on it bar a couple of accidental shots I'd taken trying to get to the end of the roll. That was a shame but it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nThe last roll was Cinestill 800T that wasn\u2019t finished by the time we made it to the airport to head home. Because I was scared of it going through the X-Ray machines inside the camera, I rolled it back just enough so that the leader wasn\u2019t in the canister and I could use it again when I got home. Then lockdown happened pretty much immediately after we got back and so I haven\u2019t been taking pictures at all. Until last week when I loaded said roll of Cinestill back into my camera. I had no idea where I left off and I was so sure that I wrote it down but couldn\u2019t find note of it anywhere. I was pretty confident it was about 5 shots I got on it so I loaded it back up, shot 5-10 empty shots with lens cap on for safety, then shot the rest of the roll and sent it away for dev just today.\n\nYou can see where this is going...\n\nToday, 5 months after my trip, I realised I had never taken any of the scans I got back from my phone and onto Google drive where I store them. I give each roll a folder with dates, camera and film used. It was when I was doing this and trying to match up the places in the film pictures with photos in the same places taken on my phone, that I realised the last film pictures were 3 days before the trip ended. I thought that was quite strange because we did so much in the final few days. Then I saw a selfie - from 2 days before we left - up at Fushimi Inari-taisha (the shrine with 1000s of red gates you see a lot in photos) and I\u2019ve got my film camera on, yet none of the scans I have feature any of this area. Immediately panicked. Kept scrolling to see if there were any more sights of my camera and then found the last photo I took in Japan which was this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hah9rbbt2j951.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b6a91548f1e8c27224b2c6dde5bc5f3242e033d\n\nA lovely idea by me that had such good intentions, but clearly meant nothing to someone as stupid as I. It was then I realised that I have double-exposed somewhere between 5 and 20 shots from a once in a life-time trip. The saddest part is the shots that may have replaced them aren't even spectacular. They're just me cutting about dreary Glasgow in lockdown!\n\nAnyway as you can imagine I feel like a COMPLETE fool. Maybe some of the double-exposures will turn out nice, or maybe there'll be more saved than I thought. Who knows! Regardless, mistakes happen and film is a tentative thing, but to say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I won't be able to re-live any of those shots for many years now and it's sad to know I've potentially lost so many. At least I know now never to make this mistake again!\n\n**TL;DR: I was an idiot and double-exposed somewhere up to 20 shots from the trip of a life time with my uneventful lockdown life in dreary Glasgow and feel like a total idiot for it.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/hn72vg/today_on_shooting_film_is_sometimes_not_so_fun/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "we made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "\n\nthe last -----> roll !!!  was cinestill 800t that wasn\u2019t finished by the time we made it to the airport to head home.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 55042, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "ZanderSchwab", "date": "2020-03-28 00:26:42", "content": "The last roll I developed came out with a crazy color shift, can anyone help me figure out why? /!/ Hey everyone, hoping the community can put our heads together and figure out what happened\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the timeline of events\n\n2/9/20: Mixed Arista 1L C-41 kit. Developed 3x rolls of 135-36 and 1x roll of 135-24. Good results except for water spots. \n\n2/11/20: Using the same kit developed 2x rolls of 135-24 (superia 200) and 1x roll of 135-36 (portra 400). This is where my problem occurred. I left the Portra 400 in the developer 30 or seconds longer than the Superia 200 and it came out with a really bad color shift. \n\nHere is a digital reference, this is representative of how the scene looked, soft yet over powering golden light\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/YyQSkDF](https://imgur.com/a/YyQSkDF)\n\nThis is the scan\n\npositive: [https://imgur.com/a/g7kKfPM](https://imgur.com/a/g7kKfPM)\n\nnegative: [https://imgur.com/a/g7kKfPM](https://imgur.com/a/g7kKfPM)\n\nThe colors rendered completely wrong. This shift is present across the entire roll. Here's another example.\n\nDigital ref: [https://imgur.com/a/JuRscCb](https://imgur.com/a/JuRscCb)\n\npositive scan: https://imgur.com/uetxcgk\n\nnegative scan: https://imgur.com/Vra1B45\n\nAny idea's what could've caused this? Again the stock is Portra 400. It did have a minor heat exposure in the car after purchase but had been cold stored since, and no other rolls from that pack exhibited this issue. The two rolls I developed prior in the same session came out perfectly. \n\nMy scanning workflow was Nikon Coolscan 4000 with vuescan, scanned to raw .dng, and converted positive with negative lab pro. I scanned this roll immediatley after scanning 2 good rolls and used the same settings. The physical negative does appear slightly different in color too, so I do not think this is a scanning issue. \n\nI still have the same batch of chemicals and would like to use it to develop 3 more rolls but I don't want them to come out with the same color shift. \n\nAny thoughts as to why this particular roll came out so wrong? I was very careful not to cross contaminate the chemistry. And I like i said i did leave this roll in the developer a little bit longer but not even the equivalent of a full stop push, so I wouldn't expect that to induce such a shift. \n\nThe chemicals were mixed on 2/9/20 and rated for 8 rolls. I developed the equivalent of 6 rolls as some were rolls of 24. Given the amount of time passed ( a little under 2 months) if I decide to use these chemicals, should I add time in development? Anyone know how much? \n\nThanks!

When you change the ISO on a digital camera you are changing BOTH the sensor sensitivity AND the in camera meter (they will match). The compensation function will leave the sensitivity unchanged but allow for intentional under and over exposure for the frame(s) for which it is used. This is not typically used to meter exposure for an entire frame, but to meter a select area of a frame, such as highlights or shadows. Because the ISO setting directly controls the sensitivity of the sensor, you can easily change ISO from one frame to another without and adverse effects.\n\nIn the case of analog (film) photography, the film itself is rated at a particular ISO. This is a physical function of the film/emulsion and CAN NOT BE CHANGED.\n\nIf a film camera has an ISO button/dial, and the ISO is set or changed, either via automatic DX coding or manually via an ISO dial, you are NOT setting or changing the ISO of the film, you are setting the sensitivity of the METER on the camera. \n\nWhen the meter is set at the same ISO as the film, this will give you the proper exposure, and is considered shooting at BOX SPEED. When you set the ISO to something different than the ISO of the film, the FILM ITSELF does not change, but the sensitivity of the meter does. This means that the frame(s) shot in this manner will either be over exposed or under exposed.\n\nWhen you INTENTIONALLY set the ISO to a value that is different from the film itself, it is called PUSHING or PULLING the film. This can be useful if the film you have is either too fast (Higher ISO = Faster film) or to slow (Lower ISO = Slower film) for your lighting. Pushing film is done when your film is too slow for the lighting conditions. As an example say you are shooting in a dark club, but only have TRI-X 400. You can set the camera ISO to 1600 and shoot the film. You have now PUSHED the film 2 stops. (400 to 800 = 1 stop, 800 to 1600 = 1 stop, for a total of 2 stops). The same would be true if you have loaded 800 speed film but are shooting on a bright sunny day. You can set your camera ISO to 200 and shoot the film. You have now PULLED the film 2 stops. (800 to 400 = 1 stop, 400 to 200 = 1 stop, for a total of 2 stops). It is important to remember, however, that the ISO of the film did not change. The film will need to be developed differently than if it were developed at box speed. The different development process is what will allow the images to come back more or less properly exposed. This is called PUSH or PULL developing. When you send your images to the lab you MUST give instructions to push or pull the film the appropriate number of stops. Failure to so so will lead to over or under exposed film.\n\nIt is also crucially important to understand that because the ISO on a film camera controls the meter and NOT the film, changing the ISO from one frame to another to get a better exposure WILL NOT WORK, but will result in a random mix of over exposed, under exposed, and properly exposed images. If you remember from above, pushing and pulling works because of a change in DEVELOPMENT. Because we must develop an entire roll at once, you can only push or pull and entire roll, and not individual frames. This is where exposure compensation comes in.\n\nRemembering that the ISO of the film never changes, compensation is useful for properly exposing specific areas of a frame WITHOUT changing the ISO setting on the camera (preventing accidental improper exposure of future frames if you forget to re-set it). For example, say you are shooting a picture of a friend agains a bright sky. Your meter will likely meter the ENTIRE scene. This means that your friend may very well be in shadow, and the final image will end up with the sky more or less exposed while your friend looks dark. If you use exposure compensation, however, you can fix this. Say you think your friend will be 2 stops parked than the background. Set the exposure compensation to +2 for that frame only. The meter will then adjust the reading for THAT FRAME. The background will likely be down out, but your friend will be properly exposed. The return the compensation to 0 for the remaining frames. This will allow you some control over adjusting frame to frame exposure even though you can not change the ISO of the film. When you use exposure compensation in this manner for individual frames, you do not need any special developing.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/j39tvt/iso_pushingpulling_and_exposure_compensation_for/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "we must develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "because we must develop an entire -----> roll !!!  at once, you can only push or pull and entire -----> roll !!! , and not individual frames.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 56748, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "TheChattyMonkey", "date": "2020-06-17 21:03:50", "content": "Exhausted/Tainted Liquid CS C41 or Premature Light Exposure? /!/ I recently bought a Mamiya 645 and developed my first roll with it (Ektar 100) The process went fine and the negatives came out perfect.

This was the first time i realised that not only the developer and the filmstock each for themselves but especially the combination of both can have a dramatic effect on the amount of grain, the sharpness and the contrast of the resulting image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoooo since i'm more or less stuck inside like everyone else i ordered some black and white films and developers and tested every possible combination.\n\nI wanted to check three questions i had:\n\n1. What is the best film/developer combination if you are on a budget and how does the result compare to something like Delta 100?\n2. Are most \"cheaper\" filmstocks - like CHM 100 // Kentmere 100 // RPX 100 // really the same emulsion, just resleeved and rebranded?\n3. Are Fomadon Excel and Kodak Xtol the same? \n\nI tested 12 Filmstocks (6 at asa 100 and 6 at asa 400) and 5 developers (in overall 9 different dilutions).   \nIn order to get at least a bit more similar development times i added/subtracted at most 15 sec if necessary. I still ended up with 40ish separate developments.. perfect thing to do in summer.\n\nSince it was such a tedious work i thought i share my results in case some of you have the same questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If it comes to ASA 100 film the best budget-solution is the more or less cheapest one you can find. I really was astonished how little grain even the cheaper emulsions produce while still retaining a more than acceptable amount of sharpness. Keep in mind, all of this still comes at a price. Most cheaper stocks lack the dynamic range, dry quite curly or aren't that scratch-resistant.    \n(Kentmere 100 for example sadly still curls after 24h of drying and scratches way to easy)  \nIn the case of ASA 400 film it's about the same. The only thing that becomes more evident is, that developers like A49 // Atomal49 // Xtol // Ultrafin really do a way better job in keeping the amount of grain at an acceptable level.  \nSo tldr:   \nCheapest film + Xtol // Atomal will give better results than expensive film + Rodinal  1+50 // FX39.  \n\n2. Yes and No..   \nCHM 100+400 // RPX 100+400 // APX 100+400 are most likely the same film.  \nKentmere films on the other hand show a similar dynamic range and grain structure compared to FP4+/HP5+. Although the film base isn't the same i wouldn't be surprised if the emulsion is.   \nFomapan 100+400 = Lomography Earl Grey+Lady Grey  \n\n3. Even though Fomadon Excel and Kodak Xtol behave similarly, Xtol still has a small lead. The only annoying thing is, that it's only sold in packages for 5L of solution. Although i never had any issues with using 1/5 of the powders at a time.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope someone will find this useful. \n\nCheers and stay safe!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following pictures are 100% zooms of the film/developer combinations.\n\nI also uploaded a .zip with all 108 full-scale scans to my drive in case anyone wants to have a look for themself or compare two specific combinations in Lightroom.   \n[Drive folder for full-scale scans](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jkDMTekLYaa4j5yL0YBET8pwg9HGHEmH?usp=sharing)\n\nAll the scans were made on a Nikon SUPERCOOL SCAN 9000 ED.\n\n[Ilford Delta 100](https://preview.redd.it/72kcet6o3ek51.jpg?width=3624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4897322c2aa7306cd47b159b07a3b86cd2f6788)\n\n[Ilford Delta 400](https://preview.redd.it/7d164a7o3ek51.jpg?width=3624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fcdce99edd29ab8c9611bb0d991e0bdfa48cc4d)\n\n[Ilford FP4+](https://preview.redd.it/bhraln6o3ek51.jpg?width=3624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5deb7bbb658b00437f7d2377cfb582cd20326a83)\n\n[Ilford HP5+ \\(Yes...

I got a lot of great advice here (and even a few donor cameras... thanks u/mochaNava!), and it really helped out. I felt very supported by this amazing community, so I felt it warranted a bit of an update.\n\nThe class - I've done two class rotations so far (the first was 5 weeks, the second was 4 weeks) and had 30 minutes per day with the students to work. I will be doing three more rotations between now and June. Each class has about 27 students in it. To get it approved by the administration, the class also has a written requirement, so their final project is featuring an important person at our school (student or adult) that has had a positive impact on them and doing a portrait series of them to go with it.\n\nThe time goes by really quickly and it has been difficult to cover all of the basic principles of photography in such a short time while also taking the students through the writing process. What I tried to do was go over the basics the first week and get every student to take a few shots so I could develop the rolls over the weekend. This way the students could be excited about the results, see how their focus is, etc. Then they could plan their portraits over the next two weeks.\n\nI am funding this project myself, so I am bulk rolling Kentmere 400 and developing and scanning at home over the weekend. This, unfortunately, limits the number of times students can photograph, see the results, and learn from their mistakes. I'm currently DSLR scanning with a Lomography Digitaliza, which is great, but I'd like an option to slide a whole roll through to get done more quickly. I'm currently looking for access to a 3D printer so I can print something like u/bradbrok created [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/dy79es/i_designed_a_thing_to_make_dslr_scanning_easier/).\n\nTakeaways:\n\n* Students quickly grasp the concept of shutter speed. The 5th graders have done especially well with it, since they do a lot of work with fractions this year. They notice the pattern of the fraction doubling/halving every stop and can articulate that photos are dark because they let in less light and bright because they let in more light. They also have a solid grasp on motion blur and why they shouldn't hand hold below 1/60.\n* Students struggled a bit more with aperture. They understand the idea of a bigger opening letting in more light, but with the time constraints they didn't have much time to see its effects on depth of field. The numbers also seem somewhat random to them since they don't double every time.\n* Focusing is HARD. We practiced with every camera, but I really thought that a split prism would be easiest for them to focus with, so we did the majority of our work on Canon AE-1's, Minolta X-700's, and Pentax MX's. A large portion of their first shots missed focus, so I found myself checking focus for nearly all of their final portraits. We will continue to practice with all of the cameras, but during the next unit I am going to push cameras with microprisms - Pentax K1000's and Spotmatics. My next rotation is 6 weeks long (yay!) so if I have time I'd like to give students the option to choose what is best for them.\n* This is brand new to them, and they love it. Most of them have no clue what film is on the first day (they mainly think it means movies) and they ask where the memory card goes, but they love getting to use old/vintage cameras. I've had students come up to me after the course is over and say they miss photography, or even ask where I got the cameras because they want one for themselves.\n\nI'm excited to see what the next few months bring as I continue to adapt the course for incoming students.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experience an issue of this sort with similar medium format leaf shutter cameras before? Was it the back or maybe the lens? How did you guys fix it?

Camera, film or my chemicals? /!/ So I developed some Fuji superia 400 yesterday and am trying to figure out why the roll turned out so dark. Prior to developing the fuji, I did a roll of Kodak gold 200 which turned out perfect. This was my second time using my c41 kit so the chemicals aren\u2019t very old or used.\n\n\nI am trying to figure out if it was my camera, film, or a possible issue with my chemicals.\n\n\nFirst, the Fuji film expired in 2010ish but I\u2019ve owned it since day one and it was stored with my also expired Kodak gold which hasn\u2019t given me issues.\n\n\nI shot the roll with an old canon af35m which I\u2019ve used once before but with gold 200. I\u2019ve found a couple of forum posts scattered around the web mentioning 400 speed film (fuji oddly enough) and my exact camera I used producing underdeveloped negatives, not sure if it\u2019s a coincidence though. I am wondering if the camera has an intermittent metering problem and maybe adjusting the film speed triggered it? I did adjust the iso to 400 on the camera.\n\n\nBesides the camera I thought maybe my chemicals were the culprit. I don\u2019t think I contaminated anything and I was as careful with my temps as I was with the previous roll but don\u2019t want to rule anything out. I developed this roll immediately after developing my kodak roll, liberally rinsing all of my equipment before. \n\n\nHere\u2019s a couple of photos of the film.
