It wasn\u2019t a show stopper, but I really like the subdued colours for days where I am shooting in midday sun and can\u2019t avoid it.\n\nFortunately, moving to Sony doesn\u2019t mean the end of Classic Chrome, or many of the other simulations, which can be replicated in some form. Obviously it\u2019s not a perfect science, but I thought I would would put out something so other people don\u2019t don\u2019t through the process as well:\n\n### Lightroom \u2013 Classic Chrome\n\nI\u2019ve built a Classic Chrome Profile for the A7iii. I took an existing attempt for an X-T1 and modified it to the A7iii and this is the result. It\u2019s probably not perfect but I think it\u2019s fairly close, and more importantly, it\u2019s free:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](c54njpu9o6731)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to try this, download the following file and import it into the profiles area:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/5le55if0n96e1iz/Sony%20ILCE-7M3%20Classic%20Chrome.dcp?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5le55if0n96e1iz/Sony%20ILCE-7M3%20Classic%20Chrome.dcp?dl=0)\n\nYou will have to restart Lightroom to get it to appear. It should appear under the Profiles and you can add it to your favorites.\n\n### Lightroom \u2013 Kodachrome 24 and 64\n\nAs an alternative, I discovered a lightroom plugin that gives you this at a cost through [https://www.gavingough.com/store/kodachrome](https://www.gavingough.com/store/kodachrome)\n\nThis is what the 24 looks like which is closer to the Fujifilm Classic Chrome\n\n![img](lw9jcozbo6731)\n\nThis is what the 64 looks like, which is a little more contrasty\n\n![img](xvgzgmrdo6731)\n\n### Capture One \u2013 All the Fujifilm Simulations\n\nThere are two options for Capture One. One free and one paid\n\n#### The free option\n\nI found the first Capture One version by accident. Many moons ago, I was using an old Fujifilm X-E2S which didn\u2019t have Fujifilm Classic Chrome, so I discovered a link which allowed me to use the X-T1 developer Classic Chrome. I didn\u2019t create the presets, they came from this thread. You can download the presets from this thread.\n\n[https://www.fuji-x-forum.com/topic/3772-capture-one-pro-9-film-simulations-incl-acros/](https://www.fuji-x-forum.com/topic/3772-capture-one-pro-9-film-simulations-incl-acros/)\n\nTo import the presets, use this information\n\n[https://blog.phaseone.com/move-your-custom-made-icc-profiles-to-other-computers/](https://blog.phaseone.com/move-your-custom-made-icc-profiles-to-other-computers/)\n\nOnce you have them loaded, they should appear under the X-T1 but can be applied to any file\n\n![img](0uk311ono6731)\n\nThis is the Sony A7iii standard one\n\n![img](t9sbv81po6731)\n\nThis is Classic Chrome\n\n![img](1ud10x5qo6731)\n\nAnd finally this is Acros Red if that\u2019s of interest\n\n![img](hjryszgro6731)\n\n#### The paid option\n\nThe second I found while I was investigating ways of improving the colour output. He indicates he has built colour correct profiles for all of the Fujifilm film simulations but I have yet to validate whether that is correct. I do think his classic chrome rendition is better however and he offers it for multiple Sony cameras.\n\nHe also offers options for Adobe Lightroom but I can\u2019t validate whether these are any good as I don't use Lightroom anymore.\n\nOverall I think to date his are far better versions of Classic Chrome but I want to do more side by side tests with a fellow Fujifilm user in future to test.\n\n&gt;[Fuji film simulation profiles for your camera](http://giuseppetorre.co.uk/2019/02/12/fuji-simulations/)\n\nAgain, the standard Sony one\n\n![img](0ofyybtto6731)\n\nThis is Giuseppe\u2019s Classic Chrome (crops are a little different but same photo)\n\n![img](o5diycfvo6731)\n\nThis is Giuseppe\u2019s Acros Red\n\n![img](zo1h51jwo6731)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/c6rlu2/how_to_get_fujifilm_classic_chrome_with_a_sony/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": false, "Selector": "i first made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "how to get fujifilm classic chrome with a sony a7iii or other sony cameras - instructional /!/ &amp;#x200b;\n\n### introduction\n\nwhen i first made the shift to sony, one of the concerns i had was about the loss of fujifilm\u2019s classic chrome, one of my favourite -----> film !!!  simulations and probably the only one i use on a regular basis.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4031, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "questioningtng", "date": "2019-08-02 22:48:29", "content": "I made a Feature Film using (almost) only an A7S and 35mm Prime handheld", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/clb5r7/i_made_a_feature_film_using_almost_only_an_a7s/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": false, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i made a feature -----> film !!!  using (almost) only an a7s and 35mm prime handheld", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 5680, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "KaplanDixel", "date": "2019-04-02 14:57:42", "content": "Is the Sony A6000 worth it? /!/ I already have a dedicated camera for producing short films (a Lumix G7), but I've been trying to make more improvements in my portraiture and street photography, where I notice the Lumix is lacking a little bit because of lack of stabilization and a grain problem that occurs unless I overexpose slightly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been looking at other fairly cheap camera options for photography, so I've been looking at Sony since I originally wanted a Sony a7r before I purchased my Lumix, but chose the Lumix for the price difference.

I travel quite a lot, looking to shoot travel videos. I\u2019ve made short films and I\u2019m a film student. Looking to learn and do a lot of street photography, couldn\u2019t do that with my previous camera for the reason that it is a slightly big DSLR body. I find it hard to take it anywhere and fit in my bag for casual events, and take into the streets. Looking for something compact. Lastly, I\u2019m looking to shoot events with it. Small-scale events would be nice to earn some money though I haven\u2019t fully explored the idea. With all of these being said, I\u2019m looking for a camera that can do everything in a compact body and be able to sustain my needs for a long time without necessitating an upgrade. \n\nIn summary, what I look for:\nFilmmaking: high IQ.\nTravel: Light. I own a Zhiyun Weebill lab and I don\u2019t think it can handle too much payload.\nEvents: all around.\n\n\nI\u2019m transitioning from the Canon 80D. I hate that camera for the reason that it\u2019s too big, heavy and can\u2019t shoot 4K. Though I admire some features of it such as its battery life, flip screen, and the cheap lenses I get to use.\n\nI\u2019ve made a little PROs and CONs list of them according to my needs.\n\nA6500 \nPROS\n- Lightweight. More portable\n- Cheaper lenses.  Cheaper accessories. Cheaper everything\n- Better in gimbal\n\nCONS\n- Crop sensor\n- Dim-screen when 4K\n- Overheating issues \n- Small battery capacity\n- Less sharp, more grain at lowlight\n- No headphone jack\n\nA7III\nPROS\n- Full frame\n- Sharper. More capable in lowlight\n- Battery capacity\n- Slightly faster AF\n- APSC/FE capable\n- Two SD slots\n\nCONS\n- Bulky. Cannot be taken everywhere\n- Expensive lens. Expensive accessories\n\nIt sounds like the clear choice is the Sony A7III but what\u2019s really holding me back in making a decision:\n\n- PRICE. With the same price I plan to get an A7III + Tamron 28-75, I get to get the A6500 + Sigma 16/30 + Sony 18-105 + Sony 10-18. With even more cash to spare and even complete all the accessoriess necessary. I can only afford the A7III with the Tamron and for me, 1.21lbs is already heavy for travel, street photography and for my weebill lab.\n- I\u2019m not sure if going full frame is worth it if the A6500 shoots almost the same 4K quality as the A7III (read in some reviews)\n- One thing I really consider about the A7III is it\u2019s more capable in lowlight? I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a substantial difference though.\n- G master lenses are so expensive! Native lenses aren\u2019t that cheap either compared to the APSC line-up and as I\u2019ve mentioned. I\u2019m still a student.\n\nPlease help me decide I\u2019ve been researching for over a week now and I need personal opinions as to what my needs are thank you!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/bmog10/decision_a7iii_vs_a6500/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": false, "Selector": "i\u2019ve made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i\u2019ve made short -----> films !!!  and i\u2019m a film student.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 15016, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "TomPark1", "date": "2019-10-03 21:44:37", "content": "Filming a CV?

I\u2019ve had a Canon T7i for the last 2 years and I\u2019m just fed up with Canon\u2019s lack of innovation so I decided to jump ship. I decided Sony is definitely the way to go for what I do, I\u2019m a freelance videographer/photographer in my area (roughly 70% video 30% photography). I also make short films, skits, and vlogs in my free time. Recently I\u2019ve been leaning towards the A6400 just for the flip up screen, slightly faster AF, and cheaper lens selection, but the A7iii has IBIS, Full Frame, dual SDs, etc I\u2019m sure you already know. Money also isn\u2019t a huge issue for me, so the price difference in the bodies themselves isn\u2019t a huge determining factor. \nWhich would you suggest for me to get? I know a lot of people will say \u201cA6400 with a gimbal\u201d but the style of a lot of filmmaking makes using a gimbal hard because of the extra carry weight and the time it takes to set it up. I do a lot of hiking and filmmaking and photography out in the wilderness. Which would make it harder to carry a gimbal, but also the weight of both cameras doesn\u2019t really matter to me since I\u2019m used to a T7i anyway. For this same reason, I don\u2019t want to have to carry an external monitor for the A7III but I think I might be able to just get used to filming without it and having a rough idea of how the framing is. \nI guess my primary question is really how important is IBIS for video? Will it make a huge difference? Especially since I\u2019ve been shooting with a camera that doesn\u2019t have it for 2 years now? I also don\u2019t shoot any more than 50mm. I might\u2019ve taken 10 photos at greater than 50mm in the entire time I\u2019ve had my T7i. \nThank you! I really appreciate any help deciding here, this has been stressing me out for weeks.

I've got a couple of questions, if anyone has the time to answer them. Sorry to ask the same old questions yet again, but I'd like some opinions. \n\nI'm coming from the Canon 6D. It's been a great camera, but it's just too bulky for what I want to do (I hike a lot, and find myself leaving it behind) &amp; the video is just appalling. Similarly, for my landscape/fine art photography, I find that sometimes it's just not sharp enough. \n\nI do a fair bit of freelance photography, and am starting to get more and more video based work, so that's definitely a consideration. I also make short films. I hear the A7III is 'better' for video, but I'm unsure what that means. \n\nI want to strip back and start fresh, so I'm really open to any focal length if anyone wants to suggest a reasonably priced sharp prime (or zoom!) With my Canon, I have a 50mm and the standard kit lens, and I think I mostly lean towards the wider side of things - 40mm and wider. \n\nWhat's everyone's favourite lens for this system? Best 35mm? And what's the 'best' SMALL lens? Much of my personal work is done while hiking and walking around, so portability is something I really want. I have the Sigma 50mm for my Canon but it's just so heavy, it rarely gets used. \n\nWhat's better - a more expensive lens on the A7III, or a cheaper lens on the A7RIII. By better, I mean image quality, sharpness etc. My personal work is often aiming to replicate the feel of large format imagery - I've been stitching together photos from my canon to produce much bigger images, so this is one thing that points me towards the A7RIII - higher resolution actually being part of the creative process. If I stick a 'cheap' lens on the A7RIII, am I wasting my money/resolution?\n\nFinally, how annoying is the file size of the A7RIII? Is it really that bad? Are there ways to work around it if you're just doing casual shooting? Compressed raw etc.\n\nHalf of me feels like I should strip back, go for the cheaper camera and get a couple nice lenses, but I fear that the images just wont be *big* enough for what I want to do, in terms of sheer detail. \n\nTo recap:\n\n**Freelance photographer &amp; soon-to-be videographer.

In the coming months these scanners will be operational at 145 airports in the US. CT scanning technology has been used for checked luggage for many years, and Kodak Alaris and Eastman Kodak have warned photographers not to check their film, but rather to carry it on and request it be hand-checked by TSA agents at Security.\n\nTo better assess the risk to film from the new carry on scanners we brought a small quantity of Portra 400/135 to John F Kennedy Airport in NYC. With the help of TSA representatives the film was put through the new carry on CT scanners from 1-10 times. The film was then evaluated at Eastman Kodak Research facilities. The initial results are not good. Just 1 scan shows significant film fogging, leading to smoky blacks and loss of shadow detail. This will be more significant for higher speed films. Although it\u2019s possible that a roll of 100 speed film would show less degradation, we strongly recommend against putting any unexposed or exposed but unprocessed film through a CT Scanner.\n\nWe reached out to the TSA to ask what options there might be to warn passengers. We originally asked if it would be possible to add signage at airports that utilize CT scanning technology. We are developing warning stickers that can be placed on your film. These will be available in a label format so they can be printed on your in-home or in-office printer. Just attach the label to the plastic bag as described in the TSA description below.\n\nThe TSA did tell us that all TSA screeners are trained to hand check roll and movie film as well as single-use cameras. Sheet film in boxes may require more diligence on the part of the photographer.\n\n**From the TSA:**\n\nMost x-ray machines used to screen carry-on bags should not damage undeveloped film under ASA\\ISO 800. There are a limited number of screening checkpoints that use x-ray equipment that may damage undeveloped film. These airports will have signage in front of the x-ray stating that the x-ray may damage undeveloped film.\n\nIf you are traveling with the following types of film, please pack it in a clear plastic bag, remove it from your carry-on bag at the checkpoint, and ask for a hand inspection:\n\n\u2022 Film with an ASA\\ISO 800 or higher\n\n\n\u2022 Highly sensitive x-ray or scientific films\n\n\u2022 Film that is or will be underexposed\n\n\u2022 Film that you intend to \u201cpush process\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sheet film\n\n\u2022 Large format film\n\n\u2022 Medical film\n\n\u2022 Scientific film\n\n\u2022 Motion picture film\n\n\u2022 Professional grade film\n\n\u2022 Film of any speed that is subjected to x-ray screening more than five times\n\nIn most cases, the x-ray equipment used for screening checked baggage will damage undeveloped film; therefore, please place undeveloped film in carry-on bags.\n\nFor more information please download the film Storage and Care Information sheet from our website: https://imaging.kodakalaris.com/sites/uat/files/wysiwyg/pro/CIS_E30.pdf\n\nFor more information on TSA use of CT technology, please:\nhttps://www.tsa.gov/computed-tomography\n\nFor more information on TSA screening procedures, please visit https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.tsa.gov__;!!NtZYYMejrjoc!zT1yWuBDz_WVf9AKKbVY49YPyeiJjKj7J1eN1H_VrLccohflzcJrblf4LaGd9CmUX8FGDRU2$ .\n\n**These US airports currently use CT scanning technology:**\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)\n\nBaltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI)\n\nChicago O\u2019Hare International Airport (ORD)\n\nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG)\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW)\n\nHouston Hobby Airport (HOU)\n\nIndianapolis International Airport (IND)\n\nJohn F.

I joyfully discovered that one of the backs provided with the camera is an *Agfa Filmpack holder*, with an actual ***Agfa Isochrom 4x5 filmpack*** inside, patented as of *July 1926*. Even more surprising is the fact that three pictures inside this 100 years old film pack were shot. Now my quest is to manage to develop those three images in order to retrieve what could be treasure. \n\nThe film has a Scheiner sensitivity of 28\u00b0, which should translate to around 50 to 65 ISO, as far as I was able to research. Does anyone have any suggestion on the developing of this beauty?  Expecially on the timing. A good thing is that there are 8 more exposures to take, that I can use to test the results before developing those three old pictures. I am aware that shooting the film now is completely different than the three shots taken when the film was good, but I was thinking of trying different degrees of overexposure or overdeveloping on those 8 fresh shots. \n\nAny suggestion is appreciated! I will home develop the film in trays, since my Paterson tank is not big enough for the system showed in the video. It is *Orthochromatic* film though, so I will be able to keep the red light on at least.  \n\nThanks to anyone that will want to help me on this exciting journey.

In one of our first conversations he told me about the \u201cprostitutes\u201d in the bohemian neighbourhood called Temple Bar. I was surprised because after couple of years living near Temple Bar I have never seen a sex worker. During the conversation I realized the women he was referring to, as sex workers, were just women wearing mini-skirt \u2013 which is a very common women outfit in Ireland and UK even during winter. For the new comer from Brazil women showing more legs than he was used to see in public had an automatic association to prostitution.  \n\n\nIn my first couple of weeks in Freiburg \u2013 Germany -, when I was looking for a place to live, I was eating in a bar with my mother when a group of 5 men joined our big table. During the conversation they learned we are Brazilians and told us with a big enthusiasm they were going to spend their holidays, in the following month, in Brazil. After a while I asked one of them, who didn\u2019t share the same enthusiasm than the others, if he was going to spend his holidays in Brazil as well. He answered with a gesture of showing his wedding ring on his finger. I suddenly thought he was suggesting that his friends were going to Brazil with sexual intentions, specially because sex tourism in Brazil is very common and many people in Sough Germany\u00a0have the image of Brazilian women as being easy to take to bed \u2013 Since Brazilians are often very attracted to foreigners. Maybe I misinterpreted his gesture, maybe he was just saying that he is not as free to travel as his friends who are single, because of family responsibilities, but I could not help thinking about sex tourism through his silent message.  \n\n\nI think it is interesting the fact that among Brazil, Ireland and Germany the first is the more conservative and moralist when the subject is nudity, which is a false morality to protect them from their own dirty minds. Different from Germany with many parks and saunas where people can spend their time - on their own, with friends or with their families - completely naked . During German\u2019s summer toddlers are running and playing completely nude in their gardens while in Brazil parents are concerned about their toddlers private parts, or even underwear, being exposed in public. In Brazil there are some isolated beaches with nude areas but in general nudity is not tolerated or allowed - not even topless regarding women. In Brazil nudity is automatically associated with sexual provocation. Ireland and the UK don\u2019t have the open air or sauna nude culture as in the Nordic countries but nobody minds women showing their skin. Once a naked woman, walking in the streets in the UK, was stopped by a policeman, not to reprimand her but, to inform her about the law saying that her being nude in public is not an offense, but if somebody complains for feeling offended then it becomes an offense.  \n\n\nAny bath place is supposed to be a place where people don\u2019t need to wear clothes. In South France, where it used to be common for people to be nude in the beaches, people, and specially women, feel less comfortable with nudity because of the new generation of young men who automatic associate nude women as a sign of \u201cavailable to sex\u201d. Women, then, became more frequent victims of harassment.  \n\n\nWhen I started with photography, in Ireland, it was always easy to find people to photograph, especially women. Soon I had my first boudoir photo shoot which for my surprise ended as nude photo shoot. It was a woman who contacted me looking for sensual photos but during the photo shoot she felt comfortable enough to just take out her clothes and continuous the shooting naked. Thanks to her I had photos for my portfolio which brought me more women wanting nude photos, especially after I developed a classic visual language with film negative\u00a0photos that people became attracted to. Most people associate nude photography with pornography - anything can be turned into pornography in fact, it only requires the viewer imagination and intention\\[1\\]\u00a0\u2013 but it is not how I see my work. As a man I am naturally interested in women's beauty and women's bodies but it doesn\u2019t mean I have the sexual view about people I photograph for being naked but the opposite; I have a big respect for people who trust me and my work since most of my photo shoots are just me and the model.  \n\n\nSome people, especially in Brazil, quickly ask me if I sleep with the models I photograph because they can\u2019t help associating nudity to sexual activity. Nudity, instead, gives people a sense of freedom. I only photographed a couple of nude men and it was more evident from them their enthusiasm for being naked - and for having a creative image of their body's expression. I first released\u00a0it when I was photographing a woman who the body seemed stuck during my posing direction. I told her that she doesn\u2019t look comfortable and that I could not get good body composition from her. She then asked me if I could see her private parts, to which I replied saying that I am too focused on the body composition, lighting, camera setting, framing , focus and the image narrative that looking at her private parts never crossed my mind. It seemed to me her worries came from the fact I was photographing her with an old manual film camera, with a slow focus ring in the lens; Because of the system it takes me a little extra time to find the focus before I press the camera shutter release. I tried to explain about the camera to her but she was satisfied with my first explanation; She didn\u2019t want to hear about my camera but go on with the photo shoot, this time feeling completely free with no worries about what in her body may be exposed, even if it appears in the photo. It is through people's eyes where we confirm who we are \\[2\\].  \n\n\nWe fear people's judgement which makes us feel self-conscious. When we are self-conscious, we feel uncomfortable, dissociated from the place and people around us, alien to our surroundings, causing us to cover who we are looking for privacy. Being naked and being accepted as we are without clothes means self-confirmation and so self-acceptance. It gives people more confidence about their body and so about themselves, because they can do whatever they are doing and forget about themselves, feeling more connected to whatever they are doing, enjoying the moment completely and so feeling free. Many people ask me how I convince people to take their clothes off or how I convince women to have certain poses when naked. I never needed to convince anybody to do anything, it was all their decision in the first place, their self-disclosure, to the joy of appearing in the world and deed without equivocation and without self-reflection that are inherent in action\\[3\\].  \n\n\nIn Germany it is much more difficult to have people who want nude photo shoots. Instead of paying me they want to be paid. Often it has to do with the fact that Germans are more cynic for feeling suspicious about people's intentions, especially those who they don\u2019t know. German introversion makes them feel more alienated from people and so more self-conscious, which explains the awkwardness that often Germans have. But this cynicism and uneasy feeling among strangers is not the main reason, it seems. I believe the main reason is because they are more used and so comfortable enough with their naked body in public. Instead of photo shoots, for the creative expression of their body freedom, they rather go to saunas and nude public parks where they can enjoy the freedom of their body without the need of interaction with another person, but on their own or with their family in their introverted manner.  \n\u200b  \nThe ancient Greek had the Polis, the public space where people could interact and become equal to others, which separate them from their private life where people had their own individuality. This public space was for Theseus what enabled ordinary man to bear life\u2019s burden, for providing the safe space for public interaction, but it was also where people hide their individuality in order to become equals and so respect each other \\[4\\]. The medieval Christianity\u00a0thinking and social tradition had no Polis separating the public and the private. People became equal to each other not through a political space designated for political interaction but through every individual, where God becomes ubiquitous in every person's eyes, turning their presence public and their action as action towards God itself \\[5\\]. Consequently, people had to hide more of themselves in order to preserve their individuality. I feel Germans keep something of this separation of public and private tradition, with their closed friend circle as their Polis where they can interact and express themselves to each other as equal, while outside it they can be \u201cnaked\u201d, with no need to hide their individuality in order to preserve it; Or as Germans like to say, \u201c*being direct\u201d*. The Irish, maintaining a more medieval Christian\u00a0tradition, have the public space on every individual eyes who they can interact and express themselves with, in order to bear life burden, but hiding their individuality in order to preserve it. The photo shooting seems to be for the Irish the private sphere where people can be free from the public \u201cburden\u201d but, at the same time, they can appear to the public by showing their individual expression through the photo results, since it is only through others\u2019 eyes we can confirm ourselves. It also seems to be the reason the so-called \u201cGerman directness\u201d is interpreted as rudeness for most westerns. Politeness is in fact against directness; Hiding our true thinking and wish to act, our individuality, to respect those through whom we see ourselves as in the eyes of the public arena \u2013 God ubiquitous. Germans feel free to not hide their true feelings because what the Irish see as public for the Germans is seen as private, the space where people can have their individuality, action without the public \u201cburden\u201d. The German introversion seems to be a preservation of their individuality on what for the Irish is supposed to be public.  \n\n\nIn today\u2019s society there is no such thing as private space other than our own home \\[6\\]. The patriarchal family was supposed to be the private kingship where one can have our individuality freedom apart from the public, the reason the Greeks, originally a matriarchal society, created the Polis as contrast to the private patriarchal kingdom \\[7\\]. God ubiquitous came to replace the Polis during Medieval times. The Equality among people is what is replacing God ubiquitous in today\u2019s society. Universal equality invades even the patriarchal family \u2013 the private kingdom \u2013 in order to assure people\u2019s basic equality rights.  \n\n\n\u200bDifferent cultures find their way to appear and to hide. In order to keep prolific with nude photography, after moving to Germany, I started photographing myself; this time with pinhole cameras which work with long exposure photography. I never felt completely comfortable being nude in public - especially coming from a judging and mocking culture that is strong in Brazil, where the public and the private are merged and confused as attempt to find their individual expression and, at the same time, afraid of losing both all together \u2013 but doing my creative work, that now included my own body expression, made me feel very good and more comfortable in my own body. Like a work of art which we create from our own expression, the body then becomes a work of art \u2013 or it has always been - through which we find our individuality in our nudity and, at the same time, our public expression through the image result. The public where we confirm our own self narrative, which without we have no identity.\n\n  \n\\----\n\n\u200b\\[1\\] HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros. Separata de; HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros: Essays.

After washing with tap water, I do the final rinse in distilled water with a few drops of photo flo and after hanging them to dry I pour some distilled water down on either side and I get very clean, consistent negatives. It is this final step of pouring distilled water down the negatives that prevents any spotting.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve been getting into color development as well. I got started with the Cinestill CS-41 quart kit. CineStill day on their website and the instruction video the stabilizer is optional, so I skipped it all together and just did the same post-wash procedure I used with black and white film and also got nice results.\n\nI finally exhausted the kit (got a grand total of 26 rolls out of it, last 2 had a light color cast though, which is why I stopped using it) and now got a 5L kit from Fuji Hunt since it\u2019s a lot more economical. \n\nBefore developing I did some reading about the kit and saw that stabilizer is actually essential in preventing fungal and bacterial growth long term and should be the last thing to touch the film before hanging to dry. Washing the film with distilled water after hanging would be essentially washing the stabilizer away.\n\nSo when developing with the Fuji kit, after fixing and washing the film I gave it a final wash in distilled water and then added the stabilizer (which has been mixed with distilled water as well) and hung them to dry without washing with distilled water anymore and sure enough the water spots (or could they be residue from the stabilizer?) are back.\n\nSo I have a few questions:\n\nIs stabilizer essential? Or is my film going to be ok if I don\u2019t use it and store it properly (paper sleeves in a dry environment)?\n\nIf it absolutely must be the last bath, how can I prevent water spots.

This is my latest iteration, meant mainly to help me digitize entire rolls of Xpan slides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEffective aperture at 1:1 and f/8 is f/16.2, so diffraction is an issue. Still, it resolves the grain in 35mm Velvia and new Ektachrome 100. The Rodenstock lens is essentially the same lens that's used in the Flextight X1/X5 scanners, and you can find many copies on ebay for around $200. The whole setup cost me about $350, not counting the GFX...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorkflow is fast. Capture takes 3-5 min per roll. With the flash at f/8, shutter speed is 1/125 so I don't have to let the rig settle every time I move the film, it's just pull the film through to the next frame and shoot. Once I have the files in Lightroom, I set a global crop and white balance, then export TIFFs to PTGui, which batches processes the stitching for the Xpan frames. Total time invested in post is a few minutes. Output resolution for a stitched Xpan frame is about 9000x3323. The main advantage of this rig to me is that it's self-contained and once built, has very little setup time each time I used it. It also takes up less space than a full-size copy stand and light table. I've also found all the copy stands I've used have too much slop in them and it's hard to keep critical focus across the whole frame at macro magnifications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblems:\n\n* Dust, as with all DSLR scanning methods. I'm thinking about wrapping some old lens cloths around the negative carrier so the film strip is pressed between two strips of soft cloth on its way into the opening. Hopefully this will reduce dust.\n* My DIY glue job on the negative carrier was not perfect, so the focal plane does not perfectly match the film plane. Result is that one side of the scan is sharper than the other. I have another carrier on order to try this one again.\n* Not easy to switch film formats. I have a 6x6 carrier, but I'd have to move the right angle, the flash, and adjust the bellows to change magnification. Also, max resolution would be about 4500x4500 since I have no ability to move either the negative or the camera to stitch multiple frames together.\n* I find working with color negative film and DSLR scanning to be annoying and the results bad. The colors never work for me, so I usually stick with lab scans for color neg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParts\n\n* Fuji GFX 50S\n* Fuji cable release\n* Spiratone Bellowsmat Auto M-42 Bellows\n* Rodenstock Apo-Rodagon D 2X 75mm f/4.5\n* 2x Desmond 250mm macro rail\n* Desmond right angle clamp\n* Omega 35mm negative carrier from a B-22 enlarger\n* Amazonbasics flash", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/c12tyd/film_scanning_with_fuji_gfx/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "\n* my diy glue job on the negative carrier was not perfect, so the focal plane does not perfectly match the -----> film !!!  plane.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 93759, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "kaleidoscopy", "date": "2019-02-12 15:07:57", "content": "I\u2019m a young film photographer and I recently made my first photo vlog thing.

While it made my issue \"better\" by marginal differences, it certainly hasn't solved anything. I thought it was development at home but I tried a couple different lab rolls that I didn't develop and they scanned with errors as well. They scanned perfect from the lab. \n\nThis doesn't seem to be an inversion error, or anything software related. It seems strictly hardware... but I've done everything I can imagine to take any point of error out of things. Everything is masked off for stray light except fo what lights the underside of a 6x7 negative. Even with this I get edge bleed or color casts. Some are better than others, some are way worse.  \n\nSo as of now i'm looking at not shooting color film at all, or sending it out for development which is hella expensive and I won't do often if at all. \n\nFlickr link showing a few images:  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/150252041@N07/albums/72157711029696702](https://www.flickr.com/photos/150252041@N07/albums/72157711029696702)   \n\n\n1.

It\u2019s always people with $2k cameras saying it too. When your camera will do 11fps, image stabilization, 50mp raw, 1/8000s shutter, face detect AF photos, I\u2019m sorry but your camera is definitely playing a large role in your photos. \n\nI mean, just saying... you don\u2019t see any professional digital photographers running around with point and shoot cameras. Closest thing is a Ricoh GRII. With film, who cares. I\u2019m legitimately not trying to be elitist here I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all done digital photography. It\u2019s far easier to improve as a photographer. The photography advancements they\u2019ve been making are astonishing but I wish advancements were still being made on film.

A high end film camera will give you a faster shutter speed and a nicer grip, sometimes more automatic settings. \n\nI legitimately don\u2019t mean to throw shade on digital photographers this is more of a rant after being a bit fed up with Becky and her 50D stepping in front of me at events like she owns the place...

It's bad quality since I basically had to hold my phone up to the viewfinder, so sorry in advance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the right edge of the image you can see this curve of darker area. The darker area on the left is because of how I took the picture I think, there is very little darkness when I look through it with my eye (though there is some). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you zoom in on the photo, you can see a bunch of floating black things all over the place. I haven't started taking pictures yet, just wondering if this is going to persist when the pictures are developed...If so, I may consider getting another camera...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't worry about the faint vertical striations, that's because I was pointing it at some ruled paper. Also, I checked and the behavior is the same with both lenses so I don't think it's the lenses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your help!!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/aggqmj/are_all_my_pictures_going_to_be_spoiled_new_canon/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "and i'm wondering if this is a problem with the overall camera, or if it's just a viewfinder thing and when i develop the -----> film !!!  it will come out alright.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 95005, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "nowayjoseTA", "date": "2019-05-14 03:54:20", "content": "Feeling frustrated with my photography and process /!/ Hey all,\n\nSo I\u2019ve been doing analog for a few years now, and I started with black and white printing my own photos in the darkroom.

One of the rolls was finished up yesterday before development and the other had exposures over a prolonged period of time.\n\nChemicals used:  \n\\- 1:1 solution of Kodak D76 - the developer powder contains 108g to make 1 litre (stock solution), and I used 37g to make 680 ml of a 1:1 solution. The powder has been open for a while, but always sealed tightly and it is still a white colour.\n\n\\- 100ml of 50% Fujifilm Acetic Acid (perhaps overkill) as a stop bath\n\n\\- Neat Fufjifilm Super Fuji Fix L (which I just pour back into the bottle and reuse)\n\n\\- Photo-flo equivalent (but it doesn't matter for the sake of this post)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe advised development time with D76 1:1 from the film box was 11 minutes. The app used suggested 12, and since the chemicals were 1 degree c colder at 19 degrees, the app suggested 13 minutes, so I went with this. I know it doesn't sound like an \"ideal\" development so far, but I've never had any problems with this before and have always got great results.\n\nSo the times are:\n\n\\- Developer: 13 minutes. Agitation every minute for 10 seconds.\n\n\\- Stop bath: \\~1 minute (although I don't believe even this long is necessary?)\n\n\\- Fixer: 5 minutes with the same agitation as developer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, after developing like this, the film came out completely transparent (including edge markings).

Also, I'm an amateur photographer and very passionate about film photography, the type of photography that reminds me of my childhood and growing up, so I need to admit that I'm pretty nostalgic about it in the digital era. The goal of the project is to safeguard film photography, know-how knowledge in this type of photography and pronounce it as a world cultural heritage.\n\nOne of my methods in the research is a survey as the easiest way to try to reach a worldwide film photography community and get a diversity of answers from all around the world. This survey is designed for the users of film photography, as an integral part of my Ph.D. project 'Analog photography as tangible and intangible world heritage'. If you would please spare 9 minutes to answer the questions, I would truly appreciate it as it will significantly benefit my research.

Before I get into my question, a little history about myself. \n\nI am in my late 20s. I started photography using digital gear (Nikon D40) around 2017, and I loved it. I didn\u2019t really think about the photos, I was more concerned about the gear. \n\nI slowly transitioned into film around 2018, and this is my main medium. No quarrels with digital at all, I am mainly a black and white guy and digital black and white just doesn\u2019t appeal to me. I shoot a wide range of film (35mm and 120) and use anything from Foma 100, HP5, FP4 and PAN F. I develop my own film and scan it myself. I send my colour fill off, I then scan it myself, using Lightroom and negative lab pro with an Epson v600. I do not have access to an enlarger yet. \n\nI have been on a major GAS journey since 2019, which has come to an end as I have settled on my forever gear: \n\nNikon F2AS\nNikon F\nKiev 4 \nRolleiflex Automat. \n\nI have a wide range of AI\u2019d Nikkors from 28mm f2.8 to 200mm f4. All cams are CLA\u2019d. I believe I have reached a point where I do not want to buy any other gear, as I want to work on own skills.\n\nPrior to Covid, I worked in a capital city and would take my camera with me everywhere, so I was mainly a street photographer. I also shot night time stuff and architectural frames. Post Covid, I have started to shoot more documentary/landscape stuff. I am not sure what particular style I should pursue. My favourite photogs are probably don McCullin and Robert Capa. \n\n\n\nI am also interested in the cinematography featured in Felini\u2019s films. I watch his films on occasion to gain inspiration. \n\nI have recently quit sharing all of my photos on Flickr, Reddit and Instagram, as I found the experience very disheartening. I have started to buy photo books and other stuff (such as the photographer\u2019s eye) to learn my skills. I watch a lot of YT stuff to try and learn more about the art of photography, by looking at the frames taken by the greats (T. Hopper\u2019s channel is great for this). \n\n\nTLDR; I am at a fork in the road with my photography.

So in those days that meant photos taken with an iPhone and in most cases heavily edited ones. \nI think the main driving force for those heavy edits was the fact that the smartphone camera was pretty bad still and giving it a \"retro\" (or other) look improved it aesthetically. \n\nI really went crazy with the edits in those days, basically crossing into mediocre \"digital art\", and looking back, some were pretty cringe-worthy, while others I find quite funny or okay even today.\n\nNow in the following couple of years my digital photography went more and more \"realistic\". I know this is a controversial term and yes, there is no \"realism\" per se but what I mean with that is, that my edits more and more simply strove to mirror what I saw with my naked eye.\nI had a longer phase during which I tried various relatively subtle looks and styles, most of them derived from film looks (VSCO, faded etc.) but a few months ago I \"couldn't do it anymore\".\n\nThat is where my \"weird reason to shoot analog\" comes it. Let me preface what I am going to say by \"of course everybody can do with their photos whatever the fuck they want\".\n\nSo what happened to me, was that I simply couldn't edit or even RAW develop my photos any more unless it was with the goal in mind to make them look like what I perceived when I was actually there. Every kind of edit, that I would do as a conscious, artistic choice, seemed \"fake\" to me. Why should I give it a \"faded\" look (crush the blacks) for instance when I very well had the RAW data to make it look more real?\n\nI know this is weird, hence the title of the post, but this is how it currently feels to me. This is not a judgment on others. When I take a photo with a digital camera and I have the option to make it look true to what I saw, I feel obliged to do so. Everything else feels like lying to me.\n\nNow one counter-argument to that could be that the truth of a moment is not what the eye sees but what I feel and perceive with my heart. And that if an edit captures that, it is more true. That means my subjectivity in a certain moment influences the edit (feeling happy, sad etc.). And while I agree with this argument in theory, in practice the \"truth\" of a \"real edit\" is of a higher value to me. Also when I look at photos, the remembering does the job. And the \"real edit\" triggers those memories better.\n\nSo why do I shoot analog (in addition to digital)? Because it does give me a surprising and different look without feeling fake. The analog film is a living part of the moment, that captures it according to its chemical composition. In a way it is closer to painting for me than to digital photography. It really is something quite fundamentally different, not just in the way it works but also in the way it interacts with me, the photographer. \n\nWhile the RAW data of digital photography urges me to use it in a way that is truthful to the moment I saw with my eyes, the analog film is like a surprising gift to me. The fact that it can look pretty different to what I saw with my eye is not only not an issue, it is a welcome addition. It is like a third party shared the moment with me. (For the spiritually inclined the word \"panpsychism\" might come to mind but we don't have to take it that far.)\n\nAnalog photography is not better than digital photography. But to me, they are fundamentally different. Not because of different resolution or dynamic range but because of the way they function. Creating a \"film look\" with RAW data might get you the same look as analog film and to a 3rd party there probably won't be a discernible difference.\n\nBut for me, photography is something that I do. My consciousness and my conscience are part of the process and that is how I feel. \nI know this post might sound pretentious but again I am only talking about myself. Like anybody else, my conscience is nothing I feel like I can control.\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/9m3rhn/my_weird_reason_for_shooting_analog_cave/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "creating a \"-----> film !!!  look\" with raw data might get you the same look as analog -----> film !!!  and to a 3rd party there probably won't be a discernible difference.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 21068, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "snuflswasmyslavename", "date": "2018-12-06 11:13:28", "content": "New sub /r/AnalogMachines dedicated to beautiful pics of film cameras /!/ I've looked for a sub about pics **of** film cameras and I can't seem to find any, so I made one: /r/AnalogMachines.

I've mostly used it for documenting my travels but lately i'm using it more often for professional work. I haven't had any problems with it until now.\n\nThe first thing that happened was in november 2020 where I used it as a secondary camera on a photo shoot outside. After the shoot when I rewinded the film I noticed that the rewind was super short. And when I developed it the film was completely blank. This had never happened to me and I got super concerned that there is something wrong with the camera, but I did some tests afterwards and everything seemed fine. So I guess that I had put in the roll in a hurry and it didn't grip-\n\nSince then i'm making it a routine to keep an eye on the wheel that spins when i wind the film after each shot, just to be sure that the film is in correctly. I've shot a couple of rolls and everything seems fine.\n\nLast week I was working on a film set in a mountainous region in Norway, and I shot two rolls with my Leica outside. It should be noted that it was quite cold, -21\u00b0C at most. Also it gets super bright during daylight, so I had the shutter mostly at 1/1000, which I rarely do.\n\nWhen I returned and developed the film there were lots of blank shots, I only scanned 12 out of 72 pictures. What's interesting is that some of the pictures are partially exposed (i'll attach some pictures). To me it seems like there is something wrong with the shutter not working properly.  \n\n\nWhat seems to be the problem here? How can some of the shots be completely fine, most of them blank, and some of them partially exposed?  \n\n\nMind you that i'm pretty confident that I am exposing the pictures correctly.

It came with a flash, which he told me to use when the shutter speed otherwise had to go below 60.  He had upgraded to an autofocus model and didn't need this one anymore.  Ever since then I was in love with the idea of this amazing gadget with tiny working buttons, gears, levers, and electronics, made of sleek metal, that could expose a frame of film for the exact duration and with the exact amount of light I wanted.  But seeing how my dad's camera could autofocus and control aperture from inside the camera itself, rather than needing to be set on the lens, was the beginning of my gear lust.\n\nI shot the camera occasionally through the end of high school but never really became a shutter bug.  I remember taking a photography class and all of my photos were dark because I hadn't loaded the roll correctly.\n\nIn 2000, I bought a Kodak 1MP digital camera because it was digital and digital was new.  I think it was the DC3200.  It was cool that I could instantly see what I took and upload it to my computer, but that thing really sucked.\n\nIn 2006, I bought a Panasonic FZ7 because it had amazing zoom.  I hadn't shot anything in a while, but 6 MP was amazing at the time and it had such a good zoom.  The ISO performance sucked in those days and if you went above ISO 400, which you needed a special setting for, the noise reduction feature gave the whole image this weird mottled look, which, despite leading to very low res photos, actually gave the images a cool look.  The camera was nice, but I still knew I wanted a DSLR when I could afford it.\n\nIn 2014, I bought my first DSLR, a D7000.  I bought three prime lenses with it (28, 50, 85) and quickly realized I needed zooms.  My gear lust also told me I needed a bigger sensor.\n\nIn 2015, I wanted something smaller and quieter, so I bought a Panasonic GX7.  The kit lens was terrible so I bought an olympus 45 1.8.  Unsatisfied, I also bought a used 12-32 f2.8.  It's a decent camera combo, but you do lose something going from aps-c to m43.  Plus the autofocus wasn't that great.\n\nIn 2016, I bought a refurbed D610 for the amazing price of $1100.  It was amazingly full frame.   I also quickly bought a 24-70 and a 70-200, zooms that replaced my primes, and probably some others in there.\n\nI also had a baby at the end of 2016, which gave me a great subject to shoot.\n\nIn 2017, I bought a medium format film Mamiya RZ67.  I shot two decent rolls with it, but quickly realized how impractical and expensive shooting with this camera is.  The best part of that camera is the sound of the shutter going off.  Oh, and looking through the viewfinder.\n\nIn 2019, I bought a D800e because $900 for pro-level gear!  That camera is amazing and works so well with the 24-70 and 70-200.  The autofocus is a huge upgrade over the D610, although most people say it's aged pretty poorly these days.  I take it everywhere I go.  \n\nI also gave my panasonic FZ7 to my baby (now 2 year old toddler), which he immediately broke by throwing down the stairs.  \n\nI still take a million pictures of my baby, and I've started really focusing on Philly themed images.

I recently began experimenting with Fujifilm X-Raw studio. I shoot raw, and I wanted to make more use of the great fujifilm film simulations as upon reading more into them they are nearly impossible to replicate in Lightroom/photoshop. \n\nI did some testing with Acros (I shoot a lot of black and white) and classic chrome. I did a raw studio JPEG with classic chrome, a Lightroom Jpeg with classic chrome, and an enhanced details version of the LR Classic Chrome version. The raw studio Jpeg was phenomenal and blew the other ones out of the water in color, tonality, etc. It wasn\u2019t a real contest. \n\nThis got me thinking: since I produce mostly jpegs at the end of the day for prints and social media, am I better off incorporating raw studio into my workflow? It has made me question Lightroom and photoshop. In the past, I would edit the RAF, enhance details, and move to Photoshop as a tif. Then I would round trip back to Lightroom for cataloging and exporting (usually as a jpeg). I always produced black and White images similar to acros but after 30 minutes to an hour. I am wondering if the raw studio conversion plus minor tweaks in LR/PS would be better, produce better files, and thus better prints. \n\nHowever, if I switched to capture one, would this resolve all of the problems?

I'm a fashion/portrait photographer. /!/ I'm a full-time pro fashion/portrait photographer shooting for various major global publications, brands, record labels, etc. Sold off my film stuff (Mamiya RZ67 Pro II, Sinar F1, and some 35mm's) a few years ago, but recently got the bug and grabbed a Hassy 503cw, which I've been enjoying, but not using as much as I thought I would. After spending a little time with an M6 in Vienna last year, I fell in love (or, rather, lust) with Leica. While I'm still far from proficient at shooting with a rangefinder, the intuitiveness and sheer quality of a Leica is just unmatched- and I wasn't even experiencing a \"proper\" brass one! So this might sound kind of odd, to want something almost solely because of the physicality of it, but it's true; I want a Leica because it just feels so fucking solid and looks so damn good. Shallow, I know... but I'm a fashion photographer after all! The few images I shot on that Viennese M6 were just random amateur street scenes, and a far cry from what I'd like to utilize one for if/when I buy one. \n\nThe M-A is the one I've set my heart on. I'm aware of all the great vintage stuff I could get for the price of just the body, but what can I say- I've really made my mind up on the M-A. It just so bloody happens that it's their most expensive film camera, almost prohibitively so. I'm a master at justifying pointless purchases to myself, however this is one where I really begin to question my sanity... I'm not a wealthy collector or someone who wants one exclusively just to flex. While there is a large component of my decision being drawn by the aesthetic and high quality feel, I do actually plan to use this thing in a professional capacity, and that's why I'm posting here today... \n\nMy works aesthetic is so heavily dependant on shooting 85mm (in full frame/35mm), but with the Leica I'd most likely keep it a 50mm-only system until I can muster up the cash to get into a second lens down the line, which would probably be a 35mm. I'm going to link you some samples of my work below and would like your opinion regarding whether or not you think the Leica would realistically be of any benefit to me- specifically, the aesthetic which I shoot. Shooting at 50 or 35 would no doubt be a departure which would likely yield some different results, which is always a welcome thing! But I'm not so much concerned with the focal lengths as I am the rendering of images. Leica's, shot at whichever focal length, at whatever aperture, seem to yield extremely flat images. Now I can see why that'd be of value in photojournalism and street photography, which Leica's are obviously so highly regarded for, but how about in fashion and portrait photography? I'd very much love to see the work of some fashion/portrait photographers shot on an Leica M system before taking the plunge. My searches have yielded very little. Any fashion guys shooting Leica are obviously using their S system, which looks lovely, but I'm too indifferent re: what I shoot with digitally (or maybe just too content with my Nikon). A Leica in the context of shooting fashion editorials seems somehow wrong, but I'm also a firm believer that the tools don't matter quite so much... plus, I'd love the challenge. Will the Leica yield images good enough to be published in ELLE or some other magazine with which I frequently work? It's easy to say \"it's entirely dependant on the user\", but I don't buy that... forgive me if I sound too cocky here, but I've shot some great stuff, all of which has been published internationally in major publications, on various different formats (digital, 35mm, medium, large format), yet the 35mm rangefinder Leica's have always kind of scared me for use in my applications- they just seem like the wrong tool for the job... but that could, again, lend a welcome aesthetic departure and adventure. Won't know 'till I'm there... it's just a massive financial gamble to take. I \\*know\\* that the Pentax 67II is the camera I \\*should\\* be buying for my film fashion stuff- and I will at some point, though who knows when if/when I get the Leica... I even thought the Mamiya 7II would be added to my modest stable before a Leica, but seriously, after spending some time with one, it's all I can think about! \n\nBelow I'm linking some examples of my work. I shoot 50/50 studio (either with studio lights or natural light) or location with mostly natural light. It's also a mix between colour and bw. The Leica would be for natural light stuff exclusively and mostly likely for more 'environmental' portraits, which I'll have to force myself more into shooting as most of what I shoot is tighter 85mm stuff. \n\nPhotos: [https://imgur.com/a/XjY2Ezx](https://imgur.com/a/XjY2Ezx)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/c1x74w/the_ma_is_so_bloody_expensive_prohibitively/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "leica", "result": false, "Selector": "i've really made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i've really made my mind up on the m-a. it just so bloody happens that it's their most expensive -----> film !!!  camera, almost prohibitively so.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13891, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "lonex420", "date": "2019-12-25 09:17:18", "content": "Lens for low-light/night photography? (film) /!/ Currently I shoot with a Elmar-M 50/2.8 collapsible (modern ver.) and Canon 28/3.5 LTM as my two main compact travel lenses on my MP. I've been struggling with shooting in low light due to the smaller apertures, basically once the sun sets or I head indoors I have to either put on a flash or break out the tripod. Both options have their problems, such as flash being distracting under certain environments, and tripods not being practical all the time, when slower shutter speeds aren't desired.\n\nI'm shooting on 400 speed film or slower, mainly Tri-X (often pushed to 800) and Portra 400.

High speed film (800 and above) is also not commonly found there.\n\nIn my case, would it be smart to invest in a \"low-light\" lens, something with an aperture in the 1.Xs? If so, should I duplicate my focal length (i.e. another 50mm but f/1.5 or faster) or get something like a Nokton 35/1.4  to fill in the gap? My main concern is I don't shoot 35mm often and I find it a weird focal length, plus it's really close to the focal length of my other lenses.

I know that these types of posts are endlessly spammed, but I've been going around in circles for weeks and would like some input. \n\nI'm currently studying at a form of art school, where for the last 6 months I've been exploring my old love for making movies. I've made a few stop motions ([Shameless plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCJXEqeOTfY&amp;t=5s)) and am excited to keep making films in whatever way I can.

I like to travel a lot and take photos with my smartphone. I'm going on a couple of more trips this year, and one of them is with my mom, who hasn't even been on a plane in over 20 years. I'd really love to capture this moment in our lives since I may not have this chance again.\n\nAnyway, I am interested in taking nice pictures and video, and may even want to learn how to edit videos so that I can post things on Youtube. I have done some research, and I love the cinematic videos and really nice professional-looking pictures. As a novice, I don't know how to explain it but there is definitely a noticeable quality difference between something that looks \"really good\" vs something that was taken with a smartphone. I want to learn how to do the former.\n\nSo I've done a little research, and I'm looking for an all-around camera that will do many things well. The Sony A6500 piqued my interest because I've seen great cinematic video from it, slow-mo video, great picture quality, small size to travel with, in the price range I want to spend ($1000-$1500 camera body), etc.\n\nNow here are my newbie questions (sorry if this may offend due to the naivete :D)\n\n1. I see cameras sold body only. Most of the pro cameras I see have these mounts where you attach a lens, which can be just as much as the camera in cost. I see these really long lenses that protrude out from the camera as well as shorter lenses. Can the camera be operated body only without a lens? I suspect the answer is no, and these pro cameras require a lens just to take basic pictures. What is a good all-around starter lens?\n\n2. Is my initial inclination toward the Sony A6500 a good choice given the fact that I want to do photo and video, slow-motion and cinematic video, maybe vlog, costs $1000-$1500, and travel around with little weight and baggage?\n\n3. Are there any other recommendations that you have? I don't want to drop in price range simply because I need to \"learn the basics first.\" I've purchased items in the past with my hobbies where I had settled at the beginner level and regretted it later because I went on to replace the multi-hundred dollar item with something that was $1000+.\n\n4. What other accessories and costs should I consider? I think I should get one of those octopus tripods where the 3 legs are made of ball-like things and you can position in many different ways. I'm also considering these: cage to mount various accessories, microphone (I see these puff balls coming out of cameras), and underwater case so I can take pics and video in water. Oh, I would also need a high capacity SD card and maybe an additional HD to store all those large file sizes.\n\nThanks in advance for any help. I am a beginner in this arena, and just want to capture those great experiences.\n\n-Chris C.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/7wye19/brand_new_to_photography_sony_a6500_good_choice/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": false, "Selector": "we had to develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "/!/ please bear with me, as i have no experience with photography outside of taking old-school -----> film !!!  shots where we had to develop the -----> film !!!  in photo class in high school.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 33067, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "bungi92", "date": "2018-01-04 01:31:22", "content": "Sony A7 II ruined my love of photography /!/ Hey everyone, \n\nAware that people here may be biased but wanted to vent my frustration about the Sony Alpha system...and perhaps am hoping to be persuaded to keep it. \n\nI purchased my camera on a whim at an airport - I had been thinking about getting a mirrorless system for a while, and the price quoted in the airport shop was a lot cheaper than anything i had seen in the US or Europe (I was in S. Korea). Up to this point I had only uses Canon DSLRs which I had a lot of admiration for and knew how to use well. \n\nI took it out for a spin when I got home and was immediately impressed with the image quality but that's when the optimism stopped. \n\nThe battery drains like crazy - to the point where I find myself really restricting how often I turn it on and take a photo. This is a HUGE issue. Part of the joy of digital photography is the ability to shoot hundreds, if not thousands, of images in one day. Shooting with the A7 II brings me back to the day of film where i need to make each image count lest the battery dies on me. \n\nThe electronic viewfinder / monitor are rendered useless if you're wearing sunglasses. Yes i could take sunglasses off but it's a pain if you're shooting outside in bright sunshine. I could also whack up the monitor brightness to full, however this would drain the battery like crazy. I also find looking at a digital projection of what's in front of me really off-putting and distracting. I don't think the resolution of the viewfinder / monitor are good enough...the live view feels really pixelated. For example, as a comparison, live view on an iphone feels great. \n\nGoing through the settings menu is a sisyphean task and pretty incomprehensible. Nothing feels like it's where it should be. Yes it's great that you can customize everything to the nth degree but it presents a very steep learning curve. \n\nLastly, and most frustratingly, is how the camera deals with autofocus and AF point selection. With canon i could easily scroll through AF points to select what i wanted the camera to focus on. With Sony there is no obvious way to do this and I am never convinced that it is focusing where it should. To make things worse, the monitor resolution is so low that you can't really tell when reviewing your images where the focus has landed until you look at it on a bigger screen. \n\nAs a result of all these issues - i have stopped taking my camera with me on trips and am not content just using my iphone! What are your thoughts on these issues? What makes the A7 II so much more superior to a canon body apart from huge resolution (which tbh is lost on the average amateur photographer) and a lighter weight body? I feel like I'm missing the point of the whole camera as the buzz it has got is legendary. At this stage - I'm most likely going to sell my sony equipment and re-invest into a Canon. \n\nPlease tell me i'm wrong and i'll learn to love the beast. \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/7nzhsv/sony_a7_ii_ruined_my_love_of_photography/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": false, "Selector": "i need to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "shooting with the a7 ii brings me back to the day of -----> film !!!  where i need to make each image count lest the battery dies on me.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 35922, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "targatopg", "date": "2018-12-17 20:38:06", "content": "Festival selected short film - please feedback us /!/ [https://youtu.be/kOmg5AmDUqI](https://youtu.be/kOmg5AmDUqI)\n\nThis short film was shot with the sony a7s2, I made it with my local friends in Perugia, Italy. \n\nIt is budget zero.

What I'm unsure about is if I'm focusing right, since it is really hard to see.\n\nMy setup so far consists of a Canon 600D with a 50/1.8 lens with a 21mm extension tube (If I add more length I loose part of the 35mm image) and a YN460 flash. I'm holding the film with a 3D printed adaptor I'm also testing. To shoot, I'm using EOS Utility. What I've done so far is to first enable Live View and attempt to focus by stepping the motor manually from the utility and try to get focus right (using a zoomed in view). This is the hard part since on Live View the image is quite noisy (I use Av mode at 1.8 for this part, to get enough light in, but still). I also tried to enable the AF via the utility but it only manages to snap focus when not zoomed in, which seems to be imprecise.\n\nI remember reading others that mentioned that they managed to focus on the grain, which seems surprising since the noise in the image does not let me see the grain itself. I try to use the sharp parts of the image to focus on, but not all photos have a good sharp part. Would it be correct to focus on the edge of the sprocket holes?

What could have happened? /!/ Drove 30 minutes to the only camera store in my state that develops ECN-2 film to drop off a roll of Kodak Vision 200T, and got a call from them yesterday letting me know that the roll was blank and that there were no pictures at all :C Super bummed out since that roll had the 2nd half of my Spring break trip &amp; some more memories with someone who lives in a different state. The thing is, I'm not sure why it was blank - could someone read this and let me know if there are any possible explanations?\n\nI used a point-and-shoot Olympus Stylus 120, and as far as I know it would have alerted me if the film was loaded incorrectly by flashing \"E\" on it's screen, which it didn't - it finished all 30 exposures, and also automatically rewinded for me. I've developed films taken on this camera before (including one other ECN-2 roll), so I'm pretty sure it is not the camera's fault whatsoever.\n\nCould it have been the film roll itself? I had a relative bring them over as carry on luggage from Vietnam, since I made more sense and was better for my wallet than finding/buying it in the US. I did ask the relative to request that they be checked by hand by the airport staff and to not let them go under any scanning, but the staff claimed that their scanners are now more technologically advanced and shouldn't affect the film, so they were scanned anyway. The previous ECN-2 roll was brought over at the same time and again had pictures on it, but I did notice that the end results had a vignette-like effect on the borders, instead of a consistent hue throughout like I've seen on other photographers' pictures. Maybe this affected the roll somehow?\n\nThe last possible explanation that I could think of is that the camera store staff mishandled the film roll, and accidentally developed it without removing the rem-jet layer :C This seems improbable though, since when I checked in the roll, the cashier double checked that it was an ECN-2 roll, charged me the higher developing cost for it, and also informed me on the call that it came back blank by directly referring to it as \"your ECN-2\" roll. They also are pretty well renowned in the area, and with my previous experiences they were extremely nice and helpful too so I really don't want to think that this is what happened, and they just pretended that it was a blank roll.\n\nI know that at this point the shots I took are gone now, but I'd still like to get some feedback from reddit in case it was something stupid that I did so I can avoid it next time. I haven't had a chance to pick up and look at the negatives, though I'm not sure if they'll give a hint as to what may have happened.

The [Plaubel Makina 670](https://i.imgur.com/2VFRenqh.jpg)\n\n\n**The Camera**- \nBuild wise I have mixed feelings about the camera, its mostly a hard matte plastic that is fairly slick to hold except for the texturing put into the grips. It feels like it was made very deliberately and with a lot of thought into design language, but even with that thought I'm still anxious to shoot it. Each control from the film advance lever to changing your film iso settings feel like something could break apart at any moment. \n\nEverything on the camera has to be done carefully, which honestly takes away a bit from shooting. I'm hoping to get past this in the future but its a knock against the camera because it doesn't **feel** sturdy, it **feels** like in some ways the camera was made for form rather than function. The best example of this is trying to [change the film iso](https://i.imgur.com/F55qlKeh.jpg) settings on the camera. To do that you have to turn that tiny textured ring which is next to the ring that changes exposure time, not only is it tiny and hard to grip but at the same time you have to hold the exposure time ring from changing because they are so close. Is it a sexy clean design? I mean yea I guess but its much harder to use than on other cameras. \n\nOn another front is bellows that in many ways are the biggest draw and flaw on the camera. \n\n**Upsides** - it means this is the lightest medium format Ive ever come into contact with. It weighs just 300 more grams than my Nikon F3 with a 50mm on. It weights basically the same as my 35mm SLR. Absolutely crazy how they managed to make this camera so light. Additionally the folding bellows means the camera folds [very slim](https://imgur.com/a/GiXg0u7) and can fit almost anywhere.\n\nThe other upside is the EXCELLENT lense this camera is equipped with, Ill discuss the lense more down below.\n\n**Downsides** - This is pretty obvious but having large bellows on the front of a handheld large camera is a little uhhh... risky. To get used to shooting this camera you have to rethink a little bit how you hold cameras. You dont hold it from the lense because the focusing controls is on the top knob surrounding the shutter button. If you don't relearn how to hold the camera it risks accidently slipping your fingers straight into the fragile bellows, and even then its always a worry using it. \n\nNow I'm not one to say whether the weight and lense is enough of a plus to warrant the danger in using the camera, Im just the guy that spent all my money on the camera that decided it was worth it.\n\n**Lense** - Now you can't switch out the lense, you get what you get, and what you get is the 80mm Nikkor f/2.8 which would correspond to about a 40mm lense on a 35mm camera. In my experience its super sharp. Now I'm not a crazy good photographer but Ill put some of my [photos](https://imgur.com/a/uUkwi6u) here as an example of the lense. \n\nAll in all its a strange, worrying, and gorgeous camera. I'd recommend it to anyone who either has enough money to not care, or someone who's willing to care while using it. I'll just keep going on being careful while using it.\n\n**TDLR: ANXIOUS SMALL BRICK SHOOTS PICTURES GOOD**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ngnea5/plaubel_makina_670_the_scariest_most_beautiful/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i would make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "hey fellow -----> film !!!  shooters\n\nsaw some posts of people doing writeups/reviews of more rare cameras that they've had the chance to use, figured i would make a little post about my biggest camera purchase.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 5855, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Sandros94", "date": "2021-05-20 00:48:39", "content": "Share your tips on home development debugging /!/ I restarted shooting analog recently, and now Ive decided to develop my film at home, so I get the ability to make my negatives the way I want to and I don't spend 12 hours per day in front of my monitor.\n\nI'm testing some local chemicals, some for fun (monobaths) some for actual testing.

I see that in the BW world there are multiple developers that can be used with different films to get various results. The BW films I\u2019ve in stock are TMax 400 &amp; HP5 400. I do plan to get the Delta 400 also soon. \n\nI\u2019m looking to buy either the Ilford DD-X or Ilfosol 3 as a starter. But I\u2019m a bit confused which one of these is the better recommended one for the above films. Any suggestions? \n\nI do plan to buy Rodinal and a bottle of HC-110 after like 2 months once I save up a bit. Since both chemicals are classified as dangerous chemicals they are quite expensive to ship to my current place of stay. So for now I decided to go with the other two as they are cheap to buy. \n\nSecond question is regarding the reusability of the Stop bath and Fixer. I saw on a couple of videos that the stop bath can be fixed and just water can be used. Another person was mentioning that adding a few drops of acetic acid in the water washing stage helps to improve the life of the fixer for reusability. I do have access to conc. acetic acid to prepare a solution if necessary. \n\nFor the fixer I read about the film translucency technique to determine if it\u2019s exhausted and some people were mentioning that a 1L fixer should be able to handle 24 rolls for a 1+4 solution. So I guess that comes to 4 rolls per individual small solution prepared. Am I correct? All valuable opinions and suggestions are encouraged. I would definitely be trying a few tests with some test rolls as the other rolls I\u2019ve are some really important events that I don\u2019t want to mess up! \ud83d\ude00\n\nThanks in advance", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/lkbpjv/which_bw_developer_is_better_and_reusability_of/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i\u2019m going to develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "hello everyone,\n\ni\u2019m going to develop my first bw -----> film !!! , so far only tried c-41.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 6345, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "isidorabi", "date": "2021-02-15 10:26:27", "content": "Olympus Mju II shutter cracked - is it possible to fix? /!/ I just got a Mju II a few weeks ago for rather cheap (as cheap as they get).

Think back to why you started to shoot film when there are almost endless options in digital. Why are you using an 80 year old mechanical camera when you have a fantastic camera right on your phone?\n\nWhat killed film in round 1? (Someone please mention 9/11. Id love to talk about that.) Was it the ease of digital? Less film waste? Cheaper? All of the above? \n\nWhat is stopping people from taking up film as a hobby? Cost of starting? Learning curve? Not enough instant gratification?\n\nNow say you can buy a roll of Portra 400 for $3. Cost of development is $3.50. You just bought a 2022 film/digital hybrid camera for $130. You can scan your film AND upload your raw scans to your computer with your brand new $60 film scanner and camera hub. There\u2019s tons of resources on how to excel at creating an incredible shot, and you only have to wait 1 hour for Walgreens to develop your film. But that\u2019s okay because you can look through your digital versions that were transferred to an app while you wait. And you can see friend\u2019s uploads too.\n\nWhat is stopping that price drop and those services from existing right now? Is it the lack of demand? If film was truly dead, you wouldn\u2019t sink the cash into it that you have.\n\nWhat would need to happen to get Gen Z (or whatever lol) on the analog train? What would need to happen to get Chloe in 10th grade just ITCHING to try out Kodak\u2019s brand new film chemistry?\n\nI gotta know what you guys think about these super terrible and fun questions. I\u2019m getting progressively more sick and it\u2019s harder to sleep now. I\u2019m not on drugs, I\u2019ve just never been afraid to ask complicated questions. God life is a nightmare.

Narurally, I've had to spend hours repairing artifacts in my scans that are specific to the analogue medium - dust, hairs, scratches, spots and so on. I am also a Computing Science student, and we are known for trying to automate everything - so for my undergrad project, I developed a deep learning-based approach to automatically detect and repair analogue artifacts in images; you can read about it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dM7Y6dkGzOqaBAZMcsDTjvaJez-gzFcx/view) and view the code [here](https://github.com/daniela997/DustScratchRemoval) if you are interested!\n\nWhile the results are extremely promising, the data I trained the models on had synthetic damage - overlays I had added manually to already \"clean\" scans. Therefore, I cannot say for sure how well it would work on non-syntetic damage at this stage. Now, I have embarked on a PhD based on my undergrad project, and to take it further, I want to collect a diverse data set of images with **real** dust and scratches, which will be used for training and evaluation of the restoration method. This is where I need this awesome community's help!\n\nIf you are an analogue photographer who scans their own film, *you* can help out crowdsource a data set of examples of analogue damage. For the purposes of the training, **we need two versions of the same scanned image - one with the dust, scratches and hairs or other such artifacts present, and one which has been repaired** \\- either manually via any image processing software, or by scanning with ICE on. Colour, black and white, slide or negative, 120 or 35mm - everything's accepted. Here's an example of a pair of images to submit:\n\n[Restored image \\(left\\) and Damaged image \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/79ykfbkm1jg71.jpg?width=3508&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94f7f6a35ba87d7eadbcb7fb10a4637df394fa54)\n\n# The data collection submission form can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/r/9BXk0h5nm8).\n\nIt includes detailed instructions for submission as well as a link to the project's Privacy Notice. **Submissions are anonymous**, but you can optionally share your e-mail address and be contacted about future publications, where you could **receive aknowledgement for your contribution to the project**.\n\nFor the sake of complete transparency, I am a student at the University of Glasgow, and my degree is publicly funded by the UKRI - there is no commercial interest involved in this project. This means that my research findings and collected data will be released publicly, as that is a condition of my funding. Furthermore, the code will be opensourced, and depending on the successful outcome of the project, I would like to develop a free web-based app where people can have the trained model try and repair their images. Others would be free to use the model for their own apps and plugins too.\n\nIf you have any additional questions about any aspect of the project, I am happy to answer them in the comments.

I noticed that I seem to have bad luck, or some sort of curse with Fujifilm\u2019s Velvia. Let\u2019s start last November. I had shot a fresh roll of 35mm Velvia 50 and eagerly took it to the lab to develop it, unfortunately when I received the roll back the lab had totally cooked it and it was solid purple, they tried telling me it was expired but I still had the box... exp 2021. Fast forward to a few months later. I\u2019ve been developing my own film for months at this point and have never had an issue, whether it be C41, B&amp;W, or E6. I decide to drop the other roll of Velvia I had into my tank with a roll of E100 and got to work. Unfortunately I forgot to wash between first and color developer so my rolls were terribly tainted yellow. Very disappointed. Never touched a roll of Velvia again until last month... shot it carefully, placed it carefully in the freezer until I was ready to develop, and took it out last week and got to work. A somewhat fresh batch of chemistry, a perfectly dark room to load it. The whole process went super smoothly. Pull it out of the tank and to my unfortunate disbelief (though I had expected this roll to mess up too) the chemistry was exhausted. And my roll was faint and discolored.

I know this will rub some people the wrong way, but I plan on creating detailed color maps and grain scans of Pro 400H so that at the very least we can create detailed film emulations in the future. I also know that Pro 400H isn't everyone's favorite film, but because it's being discontinued I figured I'd start with it. Maybe there's another discontinued film the community would prefer?\n\nTo do this I am planning on taking identical shots with Pro 400H and a matching digital shot of various color calibration charts, HALD charts, etc, digitally aligning them and measuring the color differential. I assume that this is how a lot of film emulation LUTs are made, but because nobody ever publishes their methodology or source material, I don't know if they're really doing that or just eyeballing the vibe.\n\nThe thing is, I need a film camera and lens that can also be attached to a mirrorless camera (I have a Fuji body but I might pick up a Sony for this project down the line).\n\n**Here's the question: does anyone have any recommendations for bodies and lens systems that work well across both platforms?**\n\nI was originally considering a Nikon body, but it seems really hard to find a body on eBay that's in known-working condition, and apparently many of them are sticky? Canon EF film cameras might be better.\n\nHere are some things to consider: I think for a project like this, exposure control is going to be very important. I need to be able to push and pull the film accurately, so something with good metering and exposure compensation would be really good. I have a light meter, and I'm prepared to do the calculations myself, but in the interest of time it'd be nice to have EV compensation.\n\nI am also looking for lens recommendations, since the color of the lens will also be tied up in the end result. I think perhaps a more modern lens would be good, since they're quite sharp and have a more \"clinical\" color reproduction. Another consideration is that my office isn't the biggest, so a 200mm lens will probably not work.\n\nBefore I go, some acknowledgements: First, I don't think it's possible to *FULLY* emulate a film stock's character digitally *at all*, but if we can get 80% of the way there with even remotely reproducible results, that's a win in my book.

I thought that I would do something different than a \u2018here is my gear\u2019 post \u2013 so here is my review of an AWESOME camera, you may not be aware of. This will be a long one, so I\u2019ll do a TLDR version at the end!\n\n[My first outing with the GX680iii and a woefully flimsy tripod](https://preview.redd.it/ta926eodlhz61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebbbfb6d5407980b4fe68e80f9eb20edd0210709)\n\nHow I got the camera. In the first lockdown I was bored, and a bit tipsy. I was looking at 4x5 cameras on eBay, as I want wanted to play with movements etc. I then stumbled across an auction with 45 minutes to go for a fuji 120 camera that had front movements. There was not much around on the web about it, but what I did find was pretty complimentary. I had a sneaky bid, and won! My rationale was mostly based on the fact that if I got a 4x5, I would need to spend \u00a350 odd on a spool for my developing tank, and upgrade my scanner, as my current one will only scan up to 120 film. In addition\u2026 \u00a36 a shot? Yeah\u2026. Maybe not eh!?\n\n**The Camera:** \n\nFirstly let\u2019s just talk image quality. The lenses are AMAZING! Super sharp, and the resolution you can achieve is as good as, if not better than Hasselblad &amp; Lecia. Yeah. I said it. With that out of the way, I want to focus on what makes the camera REALLY special. The first is the movements. You can move the lens up and down, as well as swing and tilt. This gives you a phenomenal amount of control for your image. I am new to using this, but for those who don\u2019t know the advantages of it, it means that by tilting the focal plane of the image to match lets say a fence in an image, you can secure that whole section in focus, without having an enormous aperture. Conversely, when taking a portrait, you can ensure a super shallow DoF with a tilt, rendering the rest of the image with a lovely out of focus blur. Now yes, you CAN do this with a lower aperture, but the effect is different, as hopefully the images below demonstrate. Please note not all the images are mine \u2013 they are just to show what you can do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Note how the fence is sharp all through the image due to the swing](https://preview.redd.it/o5skaotjlhz61.jpg?width=1875&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45179ebcd9b5d1b2a943a18ae6ddfeabc8df7854)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See the top half of the models face &amp; hair is in focus, where the bottom half is out of focus due to tilt. ](https://preview.redd.it/1s2f7zcnlhz61.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a145dddc4e67694d5e3a9b49d454aa190060f7)\n\nThe second feature that I love about this camera is that it is version 3, which is what I have, is multi-format! What\u2019s more, you don\u2019t need to but a special back, you have a cool little plastic insert that CHANGES your 6x8 back, into a 6x7, 6x6 or 6x4.5. There are also focusing screens that you drop in, so that you can frame the image. Of course, the back rotates, so that you can easily change orientation from the default landscape, to portrait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Comes in a 6x7 option \\(above\\) as well as 6x6 and 6x4.5](https://preview.redd.it/wj3w099slhz61.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea0ce6f55288fad03deb1396304e449feaff9bd)\n\nThe \u2018not so great\u2019 aspect of the camera. Its size. I call it \u2018the beast\u2019 for good reason. This thing is ENORMOUS and weighs a TON! You need a sturdy Manfrotto Tripod, and although you can, you really should not try and shoot this hand held. For comparison, see the camera compared to my 503, and even the back alone compared to a Mamiya 6! They are virtually the same size! I have taken the Fuji GX680iii out in the wild. But it is a camera you definitely have to deliberately \u2018want\u2019 to take out with you. That being said I am trying to take it out more when I have the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This gives you an idea of its size compared to the Hasselblad 503](https://preview.redd.it/7ez87rm3mhz61.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=756c9d04972481ebcbd1d1cbf3460acd96493e11)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The back, compared to my Mamiya 6!](https://preview.redd.it/rb1ne5d7mhz61.jpg?width=3222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e41a6e1b6fcda02a4fbc809bfe8ee2b2476b73)\n\nI would say that the Fuji GX680iii is really like the love child of an RZ67 Proii and a Toyo 45a. Bellows focusing medium format camera, with the benefits of the movements and multi-format features of a 4x5, but at a THIRD of the cost of either. The lenses are very reasonable as well, around \u00a3100-\u00a3250\n\nIn regards to \u2018who uses it\u2019 it is really a studio beast. For name dropping I came up with Sails Chong, who is this crazy AF Chinese photographer, whose work you should defiantly check out. He is now a Hasselblad ambassador. Think Tyler shields, but more photoshop! \n\nSo, to summarise, it is an AMAZING camera which I think would serve as a really good bridge for someone considering 4x5, but not quite sure they will use the movements enough to invest in all the extra bits. For me a new spool, scanner and enlarger is just too much. Let alone the cost of shooting 4x5\u2026 at least not yet. I get most of the features, and in some ways more, with a still pretty big negative, for less cost.  There is an \u2018S\u2019 version, which doesn\u2019t have the movements. I don\u2019t see the point in that. And the earlier versions are not multi format in the same way.

Seemed a better deal than 4x5 due to additional costs associated with 4x5 with similar results. \n\n**Paragraph 3:** Tilt, shift and swing controls on a medium format camera is amazing, gives you huge control, and gives you more creative options. \n\n**Paragraph 4:** Its MULTI-FORMAT! Special inserts (not new backs) mean you can turn your 6x8 into a 6x7, 6x6, or 645. It has focus screens, and you can rotate the back. \n\n**Paragraph 5:** Its bloody huge and weighs a ton \u2013 its tough to hand hold and you need to be fit as a soldier to carry it any kind of distance. \n\n**Paragraph 6:** I would say that the Fuji GX680iii is really like the love child of an RZ67 Proii and a Toyo 45a.\n\n**Paragraph 7:** Name drop \u2013 Sails Chong\n\n**Paragraph 8:** It is great \u2013 get version 3, but it weighs a ton. A nice bridge between 4x5 and medium format.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ndoss1/fuji_gx680_the_best_camera_you_have_probably/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "my developing", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "my rationale was mostly based on the fact that if i got a 4x5, i would need to spend \u00a350 odd on a spool for my developing tank, and upgrade my scanner, as my current one will only scan up to 120 -----> film !!! .", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 10491, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "mrnostaji", "date": "2021-07-03 02:29:17", "content": "Need help for shotting 35mm with Lubitel 2 /!/ Hello guys i've recently bought a lubitel 2 and ordered 3D printed adaptors to keep the 35mm cannister in place and a spool for the film to stuck.

I started off with just my phone and then last year my grandma bought me a cheap bridge camera. I realized what I really needed was a dslr, any one. I hopped on ebay and picked up a Canon 20d in May of this year. It was the only thing I could afford. It's really helped me improve my photography because the quality is higher than the cheapy bridge camera that was technically much more expensive than the 20d.\n\nIn June I got a Nikon FG, my first film camera. I love shooting film. It's cheaper than digital of the same quality. I now have around 8 film cameras at my disposal that were all very cheap and mostly good quality and if not good quality still good fun to use. I develop my own film too! I pay for the chemicals by charging my family members $6 a roll to develop theirs, it only takes 6 rolls to get my money back on the chemicals. I've only developed a few rolls and they didn't all come out perfect but I'm working on it. \n\nHere's why I hate photography, or at least why I'm so frustrated right now. My digital kit is the Canon 20d and for lenses I use the 50mm 1.8 that came with my nikon film camera, adapted to canon; Canon ef 50-200mm with disfunctional autofocus because it was cheap on ebay; and Canon ef-s 75-300 because I just wanted SOMETHING with autofocus and it was $50 so my dad got it for me for Christmas. My family is pretty poor so I can't get good lenses. Film isn't going much better, because since I can't afford a scanner I'm forced to use the Canon 20d for scanning and it's not optimized for it.\n\nOver the last few months I've felt like giving up on photography complelty. I love going out and shooting, using the knowledge I've gained, but I feel my gear limitations are just overbearing sometimes. Getting a job would help, but minimum wage isn't going to get me anywhere with photography. I'm trying my hardest to make do with what I have.

However, I learned the craft on film and my go-to film camera for over 20 years was my parents' old Nikon FE. Unfortunately, after 40 years of use, it finally died a few months ago. \n\nSince the pandemic began, I've been getting back into a variety of analog formats including Polaroid 600 and 35mm film. I started developing C-41 film at home and have been purchasing all sorts of new film and catching up on development of rolls up to 9 years old. \n\nCurrently, my best option for 35mm shooting is my brother's old Canon Rebel GII. I really enjoy the fact that I can use most of my contemporary equipment with this older body. Of course, like any other photographer, I want the most out of my gear and the lackluster 3 autofocus points of the Rebel seem woefully inadequate compared with the plethora of autofocus  points available on my digital 5D Mk. IV or 1D Mk. IV bodies.\n\nSo my question is this: what's the best compromise of functionality vs. price for used 35mm EOS bodies? I want a camera that supports ETTL flash and has no less than 5 autofocus points (though 7 or more would be preferable). It seems as though an Elan 7 or something like that would be great, but I've never used one and I'm hoping for some input. \n\nWhat kind of Canon EOS film camera will satisfy a pro on a budget?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/jaska0/best_35mm_eos_value/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i started developing", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i started developing c-41 -----> film !!!  at home and have been purchasing all sorts of new -----> film !!!  and catching up on development of rolls up to 9 years old.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 52471, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Timvrhn", "date": "2020-10-13 15:35:11", "content": "I recently made a pinhole camera out of a 135 film container.

I pride myself in being one of two \u201cfilm guys\u201d at our location (there are few other people there who shoot film but often the two of us are fixing the misinformation our coworkers spew). I deal with film shooters all day, complaining about price increases. That\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from, so hear me out:\n\nKodak increased prices to help cover an expansion in production - as last year was riddled with supply shortages (hence why Lomo film has been very difficult to obtain, Kodak makes that film). \n\nFuji is done with expanding film. Slide film, in its traditional use, is dead. Fuji will slowly kill the remaining lines off, issuing a finishing blow only when it becomes too expensive to manufacture. They don\u2019t even make Acros anymore, as they chose to outsource it to Ilford. Fuji will continue to raise prices until it\u2019s no longer marketable and they will kill the film division off. Honestly - they probably should. They are way more focused on the production and development of the digital division, as it actually makes them money.\n\nKodak brought back Ektachrome, but it is a slide film that is optimized for scanning and not projecting. The development of this stock was not cheap and its manufacture is not cheap - and even if it was, there isn\u2019t the market there once was to buy it so it has to be priced much higher to make a decent profit.\n\nAll major brands had increases in prices. Lomo (look at Lomo 800 in 120, it\u2019s now only two dollars less than Portra 800, and at least with Portra there\u2019s no backing paper burn or loose rolls), Ilford, Kodak and Fuji.\n\nPrice increases are part of using an unpopular medium. \n\nThe vast majority of the consumer market still believes that Kodak isn\u2019t in business and that film is dead. They have no interest in shooting film anymore, they usually chuckle at the thought of going back to film (Typically deleting photos is their point).\n\nIt sucks, I get it. I\u2019m in the same boat everyone else is. I sold my digital stuff off and went back to casually shooting film. It\u2019s a great medium.\n\nFinally - I\u2019m getting really sick of hearing \u201cYeah I really want to support the brick and mortar stores like you guys!\u201d And then asking me to price match BH on film prices. \n\nBH is cheaper because they buy and sell in volumes we can only dream of. They have a lower cost, and when you have us match prices it\u2019s causing us to loose money or make no profit. When we make no profit, our purchaser doesn\u2019t see the point in buying film for us to sell. We may make it back in processing but, yeah it\u2019s not that much when you consider the machines are being lumped along from the late 90\u2019s with scarce replacement parts and increasing chemical costs.\n\nAlright, I\u2019m done.

I have been sure to watch plenty of videos and read a ton on how to successful load and unload the camera. I am sure the rewind release is turned and I'm turning the crank the right direction.

The worst part is I can't figure out what to do when I feel this resistance, ultimately meaning I have to purposely break the film just to salvage what I was already able to rewind.\n\nThis is obviously an incredibly frustrating and expensive recurring issue to have.

This is a topic I've written about quite a bit recently, and one I'm constantly asked about, so I feel having a few prepared responses make sense.\n\nI opened the draft and realised that this actually represented one of the earliest reasons I had taken film up more seriously, but not one I'd ever made public. I had a really rough year in 2018, one of the lowest points in my life, but looking back my work definitely wouldn't be where it is today without that crucible. My justification for using film was that as long as there was a roll of film in my camera with a few frames on it, a few undeveloped rolls in my box, then I had something to look forward to in terms of finishing that roll and seeing the images. I would always load another roll immediately upon completion of the last, and would fire a few casual frames, just so that anticipation to see them would never leave. At some points this was really all that was stopping me from committing suicide, that petty, arbitrary unfinished business that I would give to myself in my film camera.\n\nI thought it was interesting, looking at where I am now where I shoot film almost exclusively, but justify it with any number of other reasons. Those have obviously built up over time as a sort of feedback loop - the more keepers I make the more I like something in perticular rather than whatever medium or method I'm not using at that moment. \n\nI won't be publishing that blog post but I wanted to put that story down here in a less formal forum, just so it can maybe offer something to anyone else who may find themselves in a similar state.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/es13hi/how_my_reason_for_shooting_film_has_changed_over/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i'd ever made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i opened the draft and realised that this actually represented one of the earliest reasons i had taken -----> film !!!  up more seriously, but not one i'd ever made public.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 57942, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "deepestplaceonearth", "date": "2020-01-21 11:55:04", "content": "Need help about the development of my film /!/ Hello friends!\nA little longer than a month I couldn\u2019t shoot with my camera and my stupid ass forgot what was inside.

[Here is a quick guide](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Convert-Digitized-Film-Negatives-into-Quali/).   \n\n\nI have been looking at setting up my Sony A7 to scan negatives for the sole reason that it seemed faster than my Epson V550. I will be very upfront that I am a total amateur photographer who takes photos on film because I like vintage cameras not because I'm trying to make money/get perfect results. Honestly the thought of spending hours configuring settings and messing with tonal curves bores me to death. This PSA are not for folks who are passionate about post processing! I don't really have a problem with the V550 other than it is slow and tedious. While looking at the costs of doing DSLR/Mirrorless scanning the one thing that kept nagging me was that to use Negative Lab Pro (NLP) I would need to get a subscription to Lightroom (LR). I had no problem dropping money on NLP, I just realized that I would never take full advantage of LR so paying $10 a month for the rest of my life to use it seemed like a waste of money.   \n\n\nI discovered that VueScan has the ability to convert JPEG files of negatives into positives using this [guide](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Convert-Digitized-Film-Negatives-into-Quali/). This feature is known but not well advertised with the software. Below are some pros and cons but the largest con for the more professional folks out there is that it doesn't accept RAW files. This doesn't really bother me as I just want something that is faster than a V550 and looks good enough to share with friends and family. My photos are for me, not for clients or my job so they don't have to be perfect! \n\n**Pros:** \n\n* Standalone package that costs a fixed amount compared to a monthly subscription\n* Can batch process images so you can load up a folder and let it run\n* Has film profiles for a lot of the larger vendors out there built in\n* Pretty easy to get up and running\n* Can give your scanner new life as well (or so the advertising says...)\n* Has a demo version of the software if you want to try it out\n\n**Cons:** \n\n* Only accepts JPEG, tiff and scanner output files (no RAW!)\n* Doesn't output RAW\n* Probably a bit more basic/less control over the process compared to NLP and LR\n\n**Quick Comparison**: \n\nI did the quickest and dirtiest comparison I could to test this out using the free VueScan demo (hence the watermarks and dust in the images). This is the same negative (slightly different crop) with one image taken by my Sony A7 with a converted macro lens and another with the V550. The A7 scan though a JPEG seems to have more dynamic range and be a bit sharper. \n\n*Processing img 9wt83g45ukb41...*\n\n[Image scanned with V550](https://preview.redd.it/o6tk7xphukb41.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14be90476ff110395ed5ad81056f3cee87fa43f6)\n\nVueScan seems to be perfect for me, a casual photographer who isn't making money off of my craft, wants to invest in a single product instead of a subscription and doesn't want to invest a ton of time in the nitty gritty of conversions.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/eqjyc6/psa_just_discovered_vuescan_can_invert_jpeg/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "i'm trying to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i will be very upfront that i am a total amateur photographer who takes photos on -----> film !!!  because i like vintage cameras not because i'm trying to make money/get perfect results.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 61576, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Mannerburn", "date": "2020-01-17 11:04:56", "content": "Trading in Nikon gear for Fuji with Pentax lenses /!/ Hi folks, I posted this in the main photography subreddit but thought you guys might have more relevant experience.

Completely, but I have an explanation. This is going to be a very very long post and I will have a Tl:Dr at the bottom but it will lack almost all of what I want to write. \n\nMamiya RZ67\nMy exact wording in the title is quite misleading, but in my opinion, the Mamiya RZ67 is the best camera you can own if you own only 1 camera. The 6x7 negative is incredible and such high quality, being close enough to 4x5 it\u2019s my favorite aspect ratio, but even if you aren\u2019t a fan of the 4x5 aspect ratio I\u2019ve always found 4x5 to be the easiest to crop to other dimensions. So for arguments sake I only want to compare it to the other 6x7 cameras, for comparing it to 35mm or large format I find to be a waste of time because anyone actually curious of that comparison would likely choose the other named format than 6x7 medium format (either because of size/portability for 35mm, or resolution for 4x5). \n\nComparisons\nWhen I first wrote this out I had a little section comparing the RZ to every single one of the other 6x7 cameras, but jesus christ that was so long, no one would have read it. So right here I\u2019m just going to say why it\u2019s better in a more general way. It is factually better than the RB, there is no opinion there. Anyone who disagrees is a salty RB user who hasn\u2019t used the RZ. It\u2019s better than the RB because of the ability to cock the mirror, shutter, and advance the film in one motion instead of 2 like on the RB. Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s a tiny comparison, but believe me it\u2019s a huge deal in the convenience of the RZ and I think most people would spend the extra money if they could just for that part. There are of course other reasons it\u2019s better I just find that\u2019s the only substantial one worth mentioning. For comparing it to the other systems, it\u2019s all my opinion and just this:\nThe rotating back allows you to use waist level finder and shoot in portrait very easily. \n\nInterchangeable backs are great. (The Bronica GS-1 also has interchangeable backs, but alas, no rotating back). \n\nAll lenses are leaf shutter. (The Bronica GS-1, Mamiya 7, only some Pentax 67 lenses, and the Fujifilm rangefinders all have leaf shutters, however, again, the RZ has the rotating back and beats all but the Pentax in the way that it has a 2.8 lens). \n\nIt has a f2.8 lens. (The Pentax has multiple at 2.8 and even faster than 2.8 but of course all of the RZ\u2019s lenses are a leaf shutter, and of course it has interchangeable backs that rotate). \n\nIt is an slr. (I enjoy rangefinders don\u2019t get me wrong, but like I said, the RZ is the best if you own one camera. If I only own one camera I\u2019d like to be able to see through the lens and have confidence in my compositions). \n\nGetting Rid of the RZ\nSo why did I do it? What did I replace it with? Well a few things. I\u2019m 17 living in the US. I don\u2019t have a job, my parents own their own businesses and I can help and make money from them when I want to but I don\u2019t have a stable or large source of income at all (it\u2019s also not that I\u2019m too lazy to get a job, my parents don\u2019t have enough business to be able to pay someone full or part time and I\u2019m not allowed to have a job for most of the year, so I just end up never having one). I can afford to buy film but outside of that it can get kind of difficult and I\u2019m very impatient when it comes to saving. \n\nThe What\nSo what I did was this, I worked and saved a few hundred dollars (it took ages) and with that money I also sold my RZ and added it all together. At that point I bought an RB (Pro S) with 2 film backs and the 90mm f3.8 c, a complete setup to develop film at home, and an Epson v700 with silverfast. \n\nThe Why\nThis will be setup into two parts, the camera switch and the new equipment. Switching to the RB was a breath of fresh air for me. Whenever I used the RZ i was terrified out of my mind of hurting it. It was plastic and expensive and in my mind that means fragile. I knew I couldn\u2019t afford a repair or replacement cost so I was so scared of using it. I may have taken 2 pictures in an entire year without a tripod. The RB\u2019s metal construction gave me confidence. I hand hold that thing like a boss now, I feel comfortable, and there\u2019s no longer months now where I shoot only 1 roll of film, now it\u2019s minimum 2 a week. It\u2019s still a cumbersome system and yeah the RZ was a little easier to use, but I never used the RZ. So this was an incredible switch for me. \n\nPeople always love to talk about how much film costs and how film makes them broke etc. Film never crossed my mind as expensive, what was always eating at me was the insane lab costs. I was using thedarkroom.com for everything. Are there more affordable labs with better results? Probably, I don\u2019t know. But no matter how I looked at it, it was going to be expensive to be able to see my pictures. Developing and scanning my film at home for the past few months has been amazing, I shoot way way more than I used to, and developing and scanning it costs so little. Because it\u2019s all at home I now can go shoot a few rolls of film with my friends or something, return home and while we\u2019re all still hanging out, develop and scan them. There\u2019s no waiting anymore, it\u2019s amazing. Some people complain about scanning and talk about how it\u2019s a nuisance and time consuming, but to be honest I enjoy it. The scanning itself is kind of fun but I find every time I use my scanner I just smile, I did this, I got this setup together and my hobby is so accessible now, and I\u2019m so happy and grateful of that. Additionally, the results from that scanner are better than any lab scan I ever got, even ones I payed extra for. \n\nConclusion\nI would still argue the RZ is a better camera than the RB (and I believe that\u2019s a fact, not an opinion). But when finding the camera that\u2019s right for you, you have to take in other considerations. When I bought my RZ I didn\u2019t fear using it at all, that never crossed my mind in the buying process. But it happened when it arrived, and I just think there are a lot of aspects of cameras that may make something a worse or better option for you than most people talk about. I had to switch to an RB. I needed the ability to shoot more film, and I got that through a camera I was more comfortable with and a system to develop and scan that costs nothing compared to my old lab. I\u2019m happy I made this switch and hopefully my experience with the two Mamiya 6x7 slr systems can shed some light on what might be right for future buyers (I mean I\u2019m probably not the first person to have this opinion and talk about it on the internet, I just didn\u2019t see anyone else say this when I bought my RZ and I wish I had been able to). Thank you and good luck to everyone in their film endeavors, go capture some sick\nT O N E Z. \n\nI\u2019d love to answer any questions if people have them. \n\nTl:Dr: The RZ is the best camera to own if you own one camera because of its wide variety of specs, but I switched to an RB and I\u2019m so happy to have. I now can develop and scan film at home and it\u2019s saved a lot of time and completely changed and increased the amount I shoot.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/i9omvx/why_the_rz67_is_the_best_camera_and_why_im_so/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "AnalogCommunity", "result": false, "Selector": "developing", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "developing and scanning my -----> film !!!  at home for the past few months has been amazing, i shoot way way more than i used to, and developing and scanning it costs so little.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 63792, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Koprico", "date": "2020-12-10 20:37:24", "content": "The quality of picture depends on the development or the digitizing? /!/ Hey everyone!\nI'm used to develop and digitize my film at a certain shop, the quality was amazing!

As such, I was thinking about getting him an at home black and white film development kit; something like [this](https://cinestillfilm.com/products/start-kit-black-friday-universal-developing-tank-2-film-reels); as well as a film scanner. (Used, because most of the new ones are out of my budget and theres always a few for around 60 dollars in our area ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to ask if this was a decent present for someone into film photography? Also how labour intensive would the process be? We're both still in college so I'm not sure if he'll use it much if it takes ages to develop. Also, our studio is kinda small so I was also wondering if all this equipment took up a lot of space (I deadass know nothing about developing film). Finally, does anyone have any recommendations/suggestions for film development equipment that I could get for him, or any other presents that he might enjoy?
