I also see people on here ask about getting into the industry, and this is one of the most common things people suggest is starting an Arduino or Raspberry Pi project.  I honestly don't think a lot of employers care about these projects and would rather see some experience or a project specific to their needs and whatever systems they use.  ROS or a similar software framework would probably be more useful for someone wanting to break into the Industry to learn rather than Arduino.  ROS can even be used to learn the hardware side as well as, if not better than Arduino.  If you're only wanting to do robotics as a hobby and build a simple robot, than Arduino works just fine.
