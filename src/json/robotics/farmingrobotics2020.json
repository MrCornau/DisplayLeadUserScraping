The challenge facing world seed producers is to create a variety of wheat that can achieve 20 tons per acre by 2020 (currently the average farming yield is about 13 tons per acre). Government bodies worldwide are aware that there is not enough wheat being produced and that wheat yields (or farm land) will need to increase by 70% to feed the population by 2050.\n\nEach year seed producers send their wheat seed samples to be graded. The results are published and farmers then purchase their next year\u2019s seed based on the results of this information. Phenotyping data is used to guide cross breeding programs for seed producers, with the aim to create a better variety of wheat. Currently data is gathered manually with sample crops of wheat measured by hand with a ruler. Measurements across hundreds of plots within the same field record the ear length, ear height, volume and spikelet numbers (number of grains per ear). These four factors indicate the quality of the wheat and how much a particular seed variety could yield.\n\nBecause this process is very time consuming, the method of capturing and analyzing phenotyping data must become an automated process in order to help create the next variety of \u2018Super Seed\u2019 wheat.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nPhotoneo PhoXi 3D XL scanner with Halcon image analysis software.\n\nThe aim of the vision solution is to capture plant traits of the wheat in an outdoor environment (fields) with a mobile rig.
