I'm doing a Robotics &amp; Automation Master's Degree focused on research. Lately, I've been kinda wondering about a couple of things gnawing the back of my brain.\n\nCurrently, everyone is looking at ROS with pretty eyes, interesting as it is ROS is a framework to manage IPC within an OS, please correct me if wrong in this, it's not a real OS (as far as I know). Also, I've been trying to use it outside of Ubuntu and quite frankly, is a pain in the ass to configure, mainly in CentOS 7/8 ( should try Debian to find an alternative to Ubuntu).\n\nIn many classes, there is a common denominator: \"The hard part is to make the comms work well and not lose too much data\". I asked a couple of people in the department and they were reluctant to talk about RTOS (its not their research focus) since the hardware they want to try is not supported, the argument is that it is not strictly necessary on high-level applications. So far so good, but here's the catch: you are not using the RTOS since you don't have the support for your hardware, that is probably Open Source/Hardware (so no problem if we edit some of the code), and distributed systems tend to need a tight window of synchronicity. I'm no expert at any of this but is just a thought I've tried to touch many times and it has been ignored as in \"no OS is really real-time\" (well butter my buns and call me a biscuit then since not even US operate on real-time)\n\nThe problem was some path planning of humanoid with more than 25 DOFs and if you are using TCP/IP and Containers you are getting REALLY high levels of abstraction (in my opinion), then we have slow machines and blame the tin can. \n\nWhy do I say we need \"prettier things\"?\n\nDon't get me wrong about ROS/YARP, great tools but we might need to develop more, ROS2 is supposed to have RTOS support so I might be \"not that wrong\".\n\nIn biology there are layers of processing, not all the brain takes the processing at all levels, I think when want to solve a location problem but I can do that and scratch my ass simultaneously. I might be pissing outside the bucket here but looking at Research Gate's questions about RTOS for Robotics only a person stated that ROS isn't an OS. In no way I'm questioning the intellectual capacity of these people, I'm just thinking that they could need help with that little problem, you just can't know all the secrets of the universe.\n\nThe other point is that currently there is no competition for ROS as a whole that I can find, YARP is also a middleware but not as developed as ROS, not as fancy or supported also. It's never a great idea to put all eggs in the same basket. Competition is the key to progress I think.\n\nDo you think we could get prettier things with a mix of RTOS and classic OS?\n\nI feel Robotics is having a slow entry to the real world, let us be honest robot parts ain't cheap chief. If someone wants to invest in a project and hears that the Doc is not getting something important right might not risk funding the endeavor.\n\nPlease, I'm just a loyalist of machines as the tool for mankind. The answers got were disappointing and I want to do a reality check. For the sound of it if, you could get something to run RTOS/OS mix and support all you need (besides a comprehensive sodding guide on \"RTOS for dummies\")\n\nAll this being said I feel it's great since we will have tons of problems to solve, this means more opportunities in the future. I'm just deeply confused with the balance of the marriage of Computer Science, Mech Eng, EEng (may this holy trinity bless us), and other stuff you need to seam together.
