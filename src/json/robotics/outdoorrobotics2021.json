At the core of our method are two components: (i) a non-parametric map that reflects the connectivity of the environment but does not require geometric reconstruction or localization, and (ii) a latent variable model of distances and actions that enables efficiently constructing and traversing this map. The model is trained on a large dataset of prior experience to predict the expected amount of time and next action needed to transit between the current image and a goal image. Training the model in this way enables it to develop a representation of goals robust to distracting information in the input images, which aids in deploying the system to quickly explore new environments. We demonstrate our method on a mobile ground robot in a range of outdoor navigation scenarios. Our method can learn to reach new goals, specified as images, in a radius of up to 80 meters in just 20 minutes, and reliably revisit these goals in changing environments. We also demonstrate our method's robustness to previously-unseen obstacles and variable weather conditions.\n\n[RECON in action](https://preview.redd.it/zjq49prc9gt61.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed6cdc3029ddb7049724274566df6e3d23a0af9)\n\n**Authors:** Dhruv Shah, Benjamin Eysenbach, Gregory Kahn, Nicholas Rhinehart, Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/mrub0c/iclr_2021_recon_rapid_exploration_for_openworld/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "robotics", "result": true, "Selector": "outdoor", "selectorShort": "outdoor", "MarkedSent": "[iclr 2021] recon: rapid exploration for open-world navigation with latent goal models /!/ this new paper from the *international conference on learning representations* (*iclr 2021)* looks into a model that is trained on a large dataset of prior experience to predict the expected amount of time and next action needed to transit between the current image and a goal image with the help of a novel robot. \n\n\\[[paper presentation](https://crossminds.ai/video/recon-rapid-exploration-for-open-world-navigation-with-latent-goal-models-60774add3a020ad369b344f7/)\\] \\[[arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05859)\\]\n\n**abstract:** we describe a robotic learning system for autonomous navigation in diverse environments. at the core of our method are two components: (i) a non-parametric map that reflects the connectivity of the environment but does not require geometric reconstruction or localization, and (ii) a latent variable model of distances and actions that enables efficiently constructing and traversing this map. the model is trained on a large dataset of prior experience to predict the expected amount of time and next action needed to transit between the current image and a goal image. training the model in this way enables it to develop a representation of goals robust to distracting information in the input images, which aids in deploying the system to quickly explore new environments. we demonstrate our method on a mobile ground robot in a range of -----> outdoor !!!  navigation scenarios. our method can learn to reach new goals, specified as images, in a radius of up to 80 meters in just 20 minutes, and reliably revisit these goals in changing environments. we also demonstrate our method's robustness to previously-unseen obstacles and variable weather conditions.\n\n[recon in action](https://preview.redd.it/zjq49prc9gt61.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed6cdc3029ddb7049724274566df6e3d23a0af9)\n\n**authors:** dhruv shah, benjamin eysenbach, gregory kahn, nicholas rhinehart, sergey levine (uc berkeley, carnegie mellon university)", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 0, "media": "self", "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/mrub0c/iclr_2021_recon_rapid_exploration_for_openworld/", "identifyer": 3510046, "year": "2021"}], "name": "outdoorrobotics2021"}
