The details of the robot don\u2019t really matter, except for the fact that it will use an Ego battery so that it can run for a long time without recharge. My question is about two things: How to step down the 56V to 12V (and then to 5 for a raspberry pi), and how to charge the battery without damaging other parts of the circuits.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what an Ego battery is, or want the specifics of the one I am using, it is an Ego 56V 7.5Ah (Pretty sure 60A) battery, sorry no link but it\u2019s really easy to find online. They are usually used in lawn machines, like lawn mowers, leaf blowers, etc, but I will be using it on a robot to power things like motors, a raspberry pi, and servos.\n\nFor stepping down the voltage, I know I can use a 56 V to 12 V step down converter, most are actually listed as 48-12 but can work at 56V. The 12 V would power the motors and servos, and would connect to another step down to 5V for the pi. Does this sound about right? Should there be other protections in the circuit? Also, if you have knowledge of Ego batteries, what is a good way of hooking the battery into the circuit, like a breakout cable for it?\n\nAs for charging it, I would like for the robot to automatically plug itself in and charge. This obviously comes with some problems. In this thread I\u2019m not worried about how the robot will accurately find its way back to the battery charging station. Instead I\u2019m wondering if anyone has recommendations on how to set up a dock that the robot can just drive into to charge itself.\n\nWith this comes multiple other things. 1. I\u2019d need a breakout for the charging pins in the battery, just like the output/circuit pins. 2. I\u2019d need a safe way to conceal the metal contacts (unless it\u2019s wireless or something) so the robot is safe around, say, children who might want to touch it. 3. Id need a breakout for the Ego charger to hook into the dock. 4. I\u2019d need a way to protect the rest of the circuit from the charging voltage when it plugs in.\n\nWould a step down converter with a range of above 56V, like 48-64 V stepped down to 12V, be enough to protect the 12V circuits from the charging voltage (it\u2019s higher than 56, but I don\u2019t know exactly what it is). Or instead could there be a 12 V battery hooked between the 56V and the rest of the circuit, with a relay on the 56V battery, such that the 12V battery keeps the pi on while it disconnects the Ego battery for charging, and then reconnects it for normal use. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d need recommendations on how to hook the 12V battery up so it charges from the 56V battery without overcharging.\n\nI know that was kind of a lot, but there are much smarter people on this sub reddit than me, and I\u2019d love to know what they have to say about this. In summary, how can I use an Ego battery to power a 12V (and technically 5V for the pi) circuit safely, and how can I charge the battery without removing it from the robot, and plugging it directly into its charger?

What all do you think is needed of a motor? /!/ Greetings,\n\n[I own a sit-in style fishing kayak](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4251270). Over the years, I've come to realize that in order to find the fish, I need to paddle quite long distances. Like I'll go to a lake, and there is no way to get to the other side for instance. By the time I paddle and the way there, and then back, i am pooped. I really need a boat... But I own a small 2 door car. So I've been wanting to simply putting a trolling motor on my kayak. However, the usual trolling motor installation doesn't interest me. A huge car battery, and a $100 motor, awkwardly mounted onto the kayak. I do not need all that and my kayak sits deep into the water as it is. I'm more leaning towards those that have converted a hand drill into a trolling motor. I'd take battery lifetime or distance over speed. A hand drill doesn't have great battery life. I have more than a decades experience doing electrical DIY. (All the hobbyist Arduino, ARM, 120v relay, IoT, small motor stuff. AAS in IT with certs) Why not make my own? But I don't have much bigger robotics experience.\n\nThe key parts of the trolling system are the motor, motor driver, battery, and the brain box. I want to use smaller 12v lawn mower lead acid batteries.  One or more in parallel as needed. A three position rocker switch for forward, off, and reverse. A stepper motor and two position momentary switch for steering left and right.\n\nWhat sort of motor and driver do you think I should strive for here? I surely don't understand all the force involved in a trolling motor. 1A, 3A, 10A? Although, I do not expect my solution to power through things like vegetation and sticks like a normal trolling motor does. Just something just to push me along for a few miles in open water. I'm planning on using a pulley system like that of a 3D printer keeping the motor away from water.
