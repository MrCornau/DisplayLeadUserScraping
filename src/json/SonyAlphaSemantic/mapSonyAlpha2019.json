I've got to say that I'm extremely excited. This looks to be almost everything we've wanted in a super-zoom lens.\n\nI've tested most of the 600mm zooms that can be adapted to the A7III, and I own the 70-200GM, the 100-400GM, and the 1.4x TC.\n\nA few major features I've noticed so far:\n\nThe obvious ones:\n\n* We finally have an E-native 600mm zoom\n* It does support the 1.4 and 2x teleconverters.\n* It's a variable aperture zoom, but mild enough to be practically fixed (1/3 stop from 200-600)\n* It hit the $2000 price point (it had to be in this range to be a viable lens.)\n\nSurprising stuff:\n\n* It's internal zooming and focusing. This is unique among 600mm zooms (as far as I know.)\n* It supports mode 3 OSS. This makes OSS more responsive to changes in pan direction. Great for sports and wildlife!\n* It has a 1/4 turn zoom. This is huge! The long 1/2 throw is a major issue on most 600mm zooms.\n* It appears to use the same foot as the 70-200 and 100-400. Great for folks who already have an aftermarket foot.\n\nStuff I would have liked:\n\n* It would have been nice to have a drop in filter, but that's not something I was actually expecting to get.\n\nStuff I don't know and want to know:\n\n* I'd like to know if it supports full-time focus override like the 70-200, or if it needs to be put in manual mode like the 100-400.\n* Weight? (I might have missed it.)\n\nMy thoughts?\n\nI'm going to rent before making a decision. The 100-400 is fine for a full-day of shooting.   My experience with 600mm zooms is that they really limit mobility. And really wear out the shooter.\n\n200-600s usually require special carrying bags. Swapping them off a body sucks, and it's difficult to simply sling them.\n\nThe 1/4 turn zoom ring is a huge usability and ergonomic win. A half turn requires a lot of wrist travel. Racking the zoom is surprisingly difficult with the front hand having to travel so far while supporting the weight of a heavy lens. 1/4 turn is very comfortable, even with a big zoom ring and heavy lens.\n\nThe internal zoom is a huge selling point for me. It eliminates the need for a zoom lock, keeps the lens balanced, and significantly improves weather sealing. Generally, internal zooming lenses have great zoom rings.\n\nA full-time autofocus override would be appreciated. I haven't heard whether or not we'll get that. I have to map a custom manual focus toggle for the 100-400, so that I can pre-focus it. With the 70-200GM I just have to turn the focus ring. I'd really like that. The 400 \u01922.8 has a full-time override, as does the 600 \u01924.\n\nI think that this lens is going to be most viable for folks who already have the 70-200GM with the 1.4x teleconverter. It would also pair well with the 70-300. 200mm is kind of limiting on the wide end, and it's good to have a compact option for times when huge reach isn't necessary.\n\nFor folks who don't have a ~200mm zoom, the 100-400 is almost certainly going to be the better option. The 100mm wide-end offers a lot of flexibility for shooting portraiture, concerts, and other stuff that would be problematic at 200mm. The 1.4x offers similar reach to the 200-600, while maintaining good autofocus performance and great sharpness.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/bzfk15/thoughts_on_the_200600_from_a_100400_owner/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "thoughts on the 200-600 from a 100-400 owner /!/ hi folks!\n\nsony dropped the press blackout on the 200-600g. i've got to say that i'm extremely excited. this looks to be almost everything we've wanted in a super-zoom lens.\n\ni've tested most of the 600mm zooms that can be adapted to the a7iii, and i own the 70-200gm, the 100-400gm, and the 1.4x tc.\n\na few major features i've noticed so far:\n\nthe obvious ones:\n\n* we finally have an e-native 600mm zoom\n* it does support the 1.4 and 2x teleconverters.\n* it's a variable aperture zoom, but mild enough to be practically fixed (1/3 stop from 200-600)\n* it hit the $2000 price point (it had to be in this range to be a viable lens.)\n\nsurprising stuff:\n\n* it's internal zooming and focusing. this is unique among 600mm zooms (as far as i know.)\n* it supports mode 3 oss. this makes oss more responsive to changes in pan direction. great for sports and wildlife!\n* it has a 1/4 turn zoom. this is huge! the long 1/2 throw is a major issue on most 600mm zooms.\n* it appears to use the same foot as the 70-200 and 100-400. great for folks who already have an aftermarket foot.\n\nstuff i would have liked:\n\n* it would have been nice to have a drop in filter, but that's not something i was actually expecting to get.\n\nstuff i don't know and want to know:\n\n* i'd like to know if it supports full-time focus override like the 70-200, or if it needs to be put in manual mode like the 100-400.\n* weight?
