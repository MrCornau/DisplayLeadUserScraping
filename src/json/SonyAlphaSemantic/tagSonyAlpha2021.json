Gone are the days of big heavy oversized monsters that required you to have a Sherpa with you at all times. Some of the bags taken up Mount Everest are smaller than the old Sigma ARTs.\n\nThe modern-day Sigma DG DN range is more BMW than Kia, but it still comes in at a Kia price tag which what is so impressive about it. Okay, maybe an expensive Kia, but it\u2019s nearly half the price the Sony GM\u2019s in most cases.\n\nI\u2019ve had a Zeiss Batis 85mm, and for the most part, I\u2019ve been happy. There is absolutely no reason other than GAS to replace it. The f/1.4 vs f/1.8 is such a poor excuse that I\u2019m not going to try to use it to justify the Sigma.\n\nThe Sigma looked really good, I wanted it, so here we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 2sk1mj0o7n861...*\n\n**Build Quality/Construction**\n\nFirst impressions last and in this case, the Sigma created quite a big first impression. The Sigma is provided in their usual white box, but the box is much smaller than what you\u2019re accustomed to with Sigma.\n\nInside the box, you\u2019ll find a semi-hard pouch, the lens and hood and the usual assortment of paperwork you never bother to read. I\u2019m pretty sure they could have inserted a winning lotto ticket in there and nobody would know.\n\nLike most of the newer DG DN lenses, Sigma has done an amazing job on the 85mm f/1.4. It\u2019s actually really hard to fault this lens when it comes to size, weight, or construction.\n\nThe previous generation was big, heavy, sluggish, lack features on the lenses, had cheap hoods, terrible lens caps, but were optically outstanding and cheap. The new lens retains absolutely none of these negatives. Okay, maybe that\u2019s a lie, their lens caps are still terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgeoo9vp7n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fb2c858a924f9bba8c94808443dc34747719ea7\n\nYes, we might actually have a brand that listens to the consumer instead of telling the consumer what they want. Maybe some of the brands like Apple and Sony could learn a thing or two from them.\n\nHey Sony, thanks for that action camera no one asked for, but how about actually providing a small and medium raw that everyone has been asking for. Seriously!\n\nWhen I first took the lens out, I panicked thinking they had sent me the wrong lens. I had to find the 85mm DG DN label on the lens to make sure because the size and weight seemed too good to be true. It\u2019s that small, almost the same size as my 24mm GM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfv02svr7n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b7994c5f8fbf4282b3a8149e1f5aef403331ab\n\nAs with the rest of Sigma\u2019s DG DN range of lenses, the construction is impeccable. It\u2019s premium level and on a par with most of the OEM Pro glass (Sony, Fujifilm, Nikon) I have tried.\n\nSide by side with the Sony 24mm f/1.4 GM, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any discrepancies in manufacturing. They have a different texture and feel, but none of them is more premium than the other.\n\n**Features**\n\nCompared to the Sigma of old, the new DG DN range is feature-rich. The 85mm offers:\n\n* a focus ring.\n* an aperture ring.\n* a button on the lens, similar to that found on the Sony GM range which you can program to do anything from eye detect to focus lock.\n* an autofocus/manual focus lock.\n* an aperture ring lock (only works in auto)\n* a switch to turn the aperture clicks on or off, assumingly for those doing video work where the sound may be heard.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s on a par with any of the premium lenses on the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sony 24GM, Sigma 85 and Zeiss Batis 85](https://preview.redd.it/dpwf7aiu7n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4186f90020a39af04edd938e204ede4c9ec39e10)\n\n**Focus Performance**\n\nAs mentioned above, the Sigma\u2019s of yesteryear suffered from some less than stellar performance issues. It wasn\u2019t bad per se, my 135mm is fairly good, but it didn\u2019t match the Sony 135mm in the focus department.\n\nWith the DG DN range, that started to change. My 35mm f/1.2 and 24-70mm f/2.8 are both outstanding in the focus department.\n\nThe 85mm continues in this line and the performance is up with the best. Whilst I can\u2019t test the DG DN alongside the GM, the other reviews claim the 85mm matches it, and in some cases exceeds it and I have no reason to doubt that. It\u2019s fast enough for sports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntyeah0x7n861.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2f42284b69352e06a06be0dd7ed6ea0d5da0366\n\n**Image Quality**\n\nOne word to describe the image quality: incredible. This thing is super sharp and I would potentially say it\u2019s the sharpest non-macro lens I have tried possibly exceeding my 35mm f/1.2 although the comparison is difficult to make due to the different maximum apertures and focal lengths.\n\nBokeh is really pleasing and soft. It doesn't look as nice as my 135mm but I'm not disappointed with it.\n\nChromatic Aberration is well controlled and Sigma has done an amazing job with flare resistance. While not perfect, it\u2019s definitely one of the best in class which will keep owners happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmt7453z7n861.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96142d8ba9006631db401bfa323705cbcc3c8451\n\nThere is mild vignetting but it\u2019s easily corrected and not the sort of thing I would be concerned about. It\u2019s correctable in camera and standard lens profiles in Lightroom or Capture One will make this unnoticeable to most owners.\n\nThere is also some distortion which may be concerning to users, but, like the vignetting, it\u2019s easily corrected. I know some users will be concerned about this because it looks bad uncorrected, but it\u2019s really a non-issue with lens correction.\n\nOverall, the strengths of the lens are in the right place and the weaknesses are easily corrected which are acceptable compromises.\n\n**Value for Money**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The camera had no issues with focus shooting into the sun](https://preview.redd.it/xxbs1yi18n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34bd5eccddfc1598b88d9d2fd18a1c3919d1f92c)\n\nWith a recommended retail of around $1200, it\u2019s hard to find a reason to complain. We\u2019d obviously all like to see it cheaper but the reality is good lenses cost money and this is about as low cost as you expect a lens of this construction and quality to cost. keep in mind that this is recommended retail so there will be some better deals to be had if you look out for them.\n\nBy comparison, the Sony GM retails for nearly $600 more. I honestly cannot think of a reason to spend that extra $600 given the Sigma matches the Sony in every category.\n\nLet me be clear, however: If you\u2019re planning to sell your GM for the Sigma, don\u2019t waste your time. The Sigma hasn\u2019t mysteriously made the GM into a bad lens. It\u2019s\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcnnqau38n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3c5ca604729c5aa5fe5172e0691a823b09f24db\n\nSigma seems to be kicking goal after goal with their latest range of DG DN lenses. Sigma has moved from being the ugly duckling to a beautiful swan and that is good for everyone.\n\nIt lowers the bar for those looking to get into Sony and it provides competition to Sony who might have otherwise stagnated with their lens performance. In the past, buying Sigma would have meant a lot of compromises but right now, there are few, if any.\n\nSome people I know think that Sony may not be happy but I think the opposite is true. This is a win for the consumer and Sony.\n\nCanon is Sony\u2019s biggest competitor right now. One of the single biggest selling points that Sony offers over Canon is a range of cheaper pro-quality lenses. Canon doesn\u2019t have an 85mm f/1.4 for $1200 unless you look at DSLR glass which doesn\u2019t offer the same performance.\n\nThat puts Sony in the driving seat for people looking to buy into a system and until Sigma start making glass for Sony, that advantage will exist.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/ko4gkz/sigma_85mm_f14_dg_dn_art_review/", "origin": "Reddit",

amazing things in recent times. gone are the days of big heavy oversized monsters that required you to have a sherpa with you at all times. some of the bags taken up mount everest are smaller than the old sigma arts.\n\nthe modern-day sigma dg dn range is more bmw than kia, but it still comes in at a kia price -----> tag !!!  which what is so impressive about it. okay, maybe an expensive kia, but it\u2019s nearly half the price the sony gm\u2019s in most cases.\n\ni\u2019ve had a zeiss batis 85mm, and for the most part, i\u2019ve been happy. there is absolutely no reason other than gas to replace it. the f/1.4 vs f/1.8 is such a poor excuse that i\u2019m not going to try to use it to justify the sigma.\n\nthe sigma looked really good, i wanted it, so here we are.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n*processing img 2sk1mj0o7n861...*\n\n**build quality/construction**\n\nfirst impressions last and in this case, the sigma created quite a big first impression. the sigma is provided in their usual white box, but the box is much smaller than what you\u2019re accustomed to with sigma.\n\ninside the box, you\u2019ll find a semi-hard pouch, the lens and hood and the usual assortment of paperwork you never bother to read. i\u2019m pretty sure they could have inserted a winning lotto ticket in there and nobody would know.\n\nlike most of the newer dg dn lenses, sigma has done an amazing job on the 85mm f/1.4. it\u2019s actually really hard to fault this lens when it comes to size, weight, or construction.\n\nthe previous generation was big, heavy, sluggish, lack features on the lenses, had cheap hoods, terrible lens caps, but were optically outstanding and cheap. the new lens retains absolutely none of these negatives. okay, maybe that\u2019s a lie, their lens caps are still terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgeoo9vp7n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fb2c858a924f9bba8c94808443dc34747719ea7\n\nyes, we might actually have a brand that listens to the consumer instead of telling the consumer what they want. maybe some of the brands like apple and sony could learn a thing or two from them.\n\nhey sony, thanks for that action camera no one asked for, but how about actually providing a small and medium raw that everyone has been asking for. seriously!\n\nwhen i first took the lens out, i panicked thinking they had sent me the wrong lens. i had to find the 85mm dg dn label on the lens to make sure because the size and weight seemed too good to be true. it\u2019s that small, almost the same size as my 24mm gm.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfv02svr7n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b7994c5f8fbf4282b3a8149e1f5aef403331ab\n\nas with the rest of sigma\u2019s dg dn range of lenses, the construction is impeccable. it\u2019s premium level and on a par with most of the oem pro glass (sony, fujifilm, nikon) i have tried.\n\nside by side with the sony 24mm f/1.4 gm, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any discrepancies in manufacturing. they have a different texture and feel, but none of them is more premium than the other.\n\n**features**\n\ncompared to the sigma of old, the new dg dn range is feature-rich. the 85mm offers:\n\n* a focus ring.\n* an aperture ring.\n* a button on the lens, similar to that found on the sony gm range which you can program to do anything from eye detect to focus lock.\n* an autofocus/manual focus lock.\n* an aperture ring lock (only works in auto)\n* a switch to turn the aperture clicks on or off, assumingly for those doing video work where the sound may be heard.\n\noverall, it\u2019s on a par with any of the premium lenses on the market.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[sony 24gm, sigma 85 and zeiss batis 85](https://preview.redd.it/dpwf7aiu7n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4186f90020a39af04edd938e204ede4c9ec39e10)\n\n**focus performance**\n\nas mentioned above, the sigma\u2019s of yesteryear suffered from some less than stellar performance issues. it wasn\u2019t bad per se, my 135mm is fairly good, but it didn\u2019t match the sony 135mm in the focus department.\n\nwith the dg dn range, that started to change. my 35mm f/1.2 and 24-70mm f/2.8 are both outstanding in the focus department.\n\nthe 85mm continues in this line and the performance is up with the best. whilst i can\u2019t test the dg dn alongside the gm, the other reviews claim the 85mm matches it, and in some cases exceeds it and i have no reason to doubt that. it\u2019s fast enough for sports.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntyeah0x7n861.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2f42284b69352e06a06be0dd7ed6ea0d5da0366\n\n**image quality**\n\none word to describe the image quality: incredible. this thing is super sharp and i would potentially say it\u2019s the sharpest non-macro lens i have tried possibly exceeding my 35mm f/1.2 although the comparison is difficult to make due to the different maximum apertures and focal lengths.\n\nbokeh is really pleasing and soft. it doesn't look as nice as my 135mm but i'm not disappointed with it.\n\nchromatic aberration is well controlled and sigma has done an amazing job with flare resistance. while not perfect, it\u2019s definitely one of the best in class which will keep owners happy.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmt7453z7n861.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96142d8ba9006631db401bfa323705cbcc3c8451\n\nthere is mild vignetting but it\u2019s easily corrected and not the sort of thing i would be concerned about. it\u2019s correctable in camera and standard lens profiles in lightroom or capture one will make this unnoticeable to most owners.\n\nthere is also some distortion which may be concerning to users, but, like the vignetting, it\u2019s easily corrected. i know some users will be concerned about this because it looks bad uncorrected, but it\u2019s really a non-issue with lens correction.\n\noverall, the strengths of the lens are in the right place and the weaknesses are easily corrected which are acceptable compromises.\n\n**value for money**\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[the camera had no issues with focus shooting into the sun](https://preview.redd.it/xxbs1yi18n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34bd5eccddfc1598b88d9d2fd18a1c3919d1f92c)\n\nwith a recommended retail of around $1200, it\u2019s hard to find a reason to complain. we\u2019d obviously all like to see it cheaper but the reality is good lenses cost money and this is about as low cost as you expect a lens of this construction and quality to cost. keep in mind that this is recommended retail so there will be some better deals to be had if you look out for them.\n\nby comparison, the sony gm retails for nearly $600 more. i honestly cannot think of a reason to spend that extra $600 given the sigma matches the sony in every category.\n\nlet me be clear, however: if you\u2019re planning to sell your gm for the sigma, don\u2019t waste your time. the sigma hasn\u2019t mysteriously made the gm into a bad lens. it\u2019s\n\n**conclusion**\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcnnqau38n861.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3c5ca604729c5aa5fe5172e0691a823b09f24db\n\nsigma seems to be kicking goal after goal with their latest range of dg dn lenses. sigma has moved from being the ugly duckling to a beautiful swan and that is good for everyone.\n\nit lowers the bar for those looking to get into sony and it provides competition to sony who might have otherwise stagnated with their lens performance. in the past, buying sigma would have meant a lot of compromises but right now, there are few, if any.\n\nsome people i know think that sony may not be happy but i think the opposite is true. this is a win for the consumer and sony.\n\ncanon is sony\u2019s biggest competitor right now. one of the single biggest selling points that sony offers over canon is a range of cheaper pro-quality lenses. canon doesn\u2019t have an 85mm f/1.4 for $1200 unless you look at dslr glass which doesn\u2019t offer the same performance.\n\nthat puts sony in the driving seat for people looking to buy into a system and until sigma start making glass for sony, that advantage will exist.",
