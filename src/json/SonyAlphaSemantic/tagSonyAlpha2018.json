Need recommendation for my first A7RIII lens /!/ I am a true newbie. I have not owned a mirrorless or DSLR before. I've been a kind of photo 'enthusiast' but never a camera enthusiast and never bothered with buying a DSLR before. Now, with travel in the plans for the next 2 years (7 trips across multiple continents with my SO and young son), it felt like the right time to buy a really good camera.

That said, it costs $2200 and while I can afford it, I also want to ensure that I'm buying something that I can use for a decade or more instead at that cost. That's when I had a second thought: why not buy multiple cheap lens that does one thing only without the GM tag. This way, I get to 'build' my lens kit, experimenting with different lenses and learning the proper way AND ensuring that I make informed purchases on the lenses in the future.\n\nThe purpose of buying the camera is mostly to do portraits (family) - 40%, scenery (some landscape) - 30% and locations (wide angle) - 30%.

This originally led me to consider purchasing the Canon T7i and Nikon D5600. However, after watching Tony and Chelsea Northrup's camera brand history videos and considering where Sony, Nikon, and Canon are heading, it seems like Sony is more poised to dedicate itself to camera innovation, where as Nikon and Canon are looking elsewhere. When I asked myself if I would personally invest in Nikon, Canon, or Sony, the answer was Sony.\n\nThis, in turn, made me take a look at the Sony options that were in my price range. The A6000 looks pretty appealing. The size, image quality, and auto-focusing speed all look really good, but I saw some issues with the kit lens ceasing to function and an issue with overheating. If I plan to take my new camera with me when travelling, would I have to worry about technical issues that would tank my photography for an entire trip? Does the A7 (base model) have the same issues?\n\nFurthermore, it seems as if the world of Zeiss glass is pretty inaccessible to a beginner. Have any of you found the price of Sony lenses to be especially prohibitive, our should I not even worry about this issue as a beginner?\n\nI know this post is getting really long winded, so I'll wrap it up with a bit of a TL;DR.

I've been using the A6000 for 6 months now, since I started getting into photography again, and I have to say I'm really impressed by what it does for the price. But when I decided to start picking up photography as a hobby I mainly bought the A6000 for budget reasons, since I first wanted to see if the hobby sticks before I put more money on the table. \n\nI have a professional background in computer graphics, which basically means I've been photographing in the \"virtual space\" for 15 years now, but real-life photography enabled me to leave the house a lot more, so I really want to stick with it and expand my possibilites with my gear.\n\nNow I find myself debating over what would be the next logical step to upgrade to. I mainly shoot a mixture of architecture, landscape, portrait and some street photography. Wildlife and more action-oriented themes like sports are not really my main concern.\n\nI've been seriously eyeing the a7iii, and I'm 100% sure it would be a great camera to use, but I'm not sure yet if it's worth the price tag for me personally. \n\nSome of my key factors for considering going FF (especially the a7iii) are low light capability, IBIS, overall improvement in IQ, weather proofing and the general FF look.\n\nWhat's putting me off a bit is the fact that I'm quite happy with the lens setup I've assembled over the last few months and that it proved quite challenging so far to find some reasonably priced alternatives.\n\nMy current lenses that I frequently use are:\n\n12mm 2.0 Rokinon/Samyang\n\n19mm 2.8 Sigma Art AF DN\n\n50mm 1.4 Canon FD adapted\n\n135mm 2.8 Canon FD adapted\n\nSince my style is not really action-oriented I really enjoy using manual focus lenses, especially those vintage Canon's are a real joy to use, and I would definitely keep those also for FF. The 135mm would probably even of more use to me, due to the missing crop factor on FF.\n\nThis would leave me in the market for a \\~85mm portrait lens and a \\~15-20mm Wide Angle lens. The 85mm range should be fairly easy to cover, but the wide angle lens is giving me some headaches. I really like the Samyang I currently have, but for their FF lenses it seems the build quality isn't quite up to snuff from what I have gathered so far. A vintage Canon 20mm 2.8 also costs about 350\u20ac, but probably won't match the 12mm 2.0 in terms of quality. So I'm a bit lost here - the Sony 16-35 4.0 would be an alternative, because for the price it could cover the need of a second additional lens &amp; some other goodies, but I've been reading also some varying opinions about it. Any alternatives?\n\nBut before I'm rambling on much further - is it even worth to upgrade or am I just lusting for gear?\n\nWould love to hear your opinions!\n\nBest", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/9aag2u/upgrading_to_ff_from_a6000/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "upgrading to ff from a6000 /!/ hi guys,\n\ni'm currently thinking about upgrading my gear from a a6000 to a ff body. i've been using the a6000 for 6 months now, since i started getting into photography again, and i have to say i'm really impressed by what it does for the price. but when i decided to start picking up photography as a hobby i mainly bought the a6000 for budget reasons, since i first wanted to see if the hobby sticks before i put more money on the table. \n\ni have a professional background in computer graphics, which basically means i've been photographing in the \"virtual space\" for 15 years now, but real-life photography enabled me to leave the house a lot more, so i really want to stick with it and expand my possibilites with my gear.\n\nnow i find myself debating over what would be the next logical step to upgrade to. i mainly shoot a mixture of architecture, landscape, portrait and some street photography. wildlife and more action-oriented themes like sports are not really my main concern.\n\ni've been seriously eyeing the a7iii, and i'm 100% sure it would be a great camera to use, but i'm not sure yet if it's worth the price -----> tag !!!  for me personally. \n\nsome of my key factors for considering going ff (especially the a7iii) are low light capability, ibis, overall improvement in iq, weather proofing and the general ff look.\n\nwhat's putting me off a bit is the fact that i'm quite happy with the lens setup i've assembled over the last few months and that it proved quite challenging so far to find some reasonably priced alternatives.\n\nmy current lenses that i frequently use are:\n\n12mm 2.0 rokinon/samyang\n\n19mm 2.8 sigma art af dn\n\n50mm 1.4 canon fd adapted\n\n135mm 2.8 canon fd adapted\n\nsince my style is not really action-oriented i really enjoy using manual focus lenses, especially those vintage canon's are a real joy to use, and i would definitely keep those also for ff. the 135mm would probably even of more use to me, due to the missing crop factor on ff.\n\nthis would leave me in the market for a \\~85mm portrait lens and a \\~15-20mm wide angle lens. the 85mm range should be fairly easy to cover, but the wide angle lens is giving me some headaches. i really like the samyang i currently have, but for their ff lenses it seems the build quality isn't quite up to snuff from what i have gathered so far. a vintage canon 20mm 2.8 also costs about 350\u20ac, but probably won't match the 12mm 2.0 in terms of quality. so i'm a bit lost here - the sony 16-35 4.0 would be an alternative, because for the price it could cover the need of a second additional lens &amp; some other goodies, but i've been reading also some varying opinions about it. any alternatives?\n\nbut before i'm rambling on much further - is it even worth to upgrade or am i just lusting for gear?\n\nwould love to hear your opinions!\n\nbest", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 42993, "year": "2018"}], "name": "tagSonyAlpha2018"}
