I'm have finally decided to take the jump to Sony.  Well the thing is that I'm quite torn on what lenses to buy. I'm a part  time portrait/fashion/advertising photographer at my own studio called [www.epic.is](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epic.is%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3Il1aQYOI_1iXOeedpulzZ_8Xx1w-BViPQsWdtBzHLSEZ-_NeiYz7nFas&amp;h=AT1nFbIEK68wZuvvNM6EZc7dHPK8u0PAy2OYsGcJGDkE3P58kXFf9M9K7yIa7UK5Bph4u_j_LZjQTgg3JXq9OnAp1zxusiIAHu7wMPaYQmPLobMBLmlHvMsDc3ShDdx9EGci6D6waDmsSV4FzjtNybIMm2sS) \n\n Currently I'm shooting Pentax K1 with various lenses. The main reason  I'm switching is the eye focus as the A7 RIV can finally deliver better  MP that the K1. \n\nMy current workhorses.   \n \\- Pentax 24-70 2.8 (  My under pressure lens, If I'm working on a changing area, birthday or  something similar where I have to be shooting portraits and group candid  at the same time I use this lens. )  \n \\- Pentax 100mm Macro ( My favorite portrait lens and crucial for product shoots in Nature )   \n  \\- Sigma 35 1.4 Art. ( Love this one, defiantly outshines the 24-70 and  use it when ever I can, awesome for outdoors and when I take landscapes.  \n\nMy current backups.   \n \\- Pentax 50mm 1.4 ( Only used in  certain advertising shoots, it is sharper than 24-70 but I'm often lazy  to put it on as the 24-70 does the job. )  \n \\- Samyang 85mm 1.4 ( Was my main portrait lens but 100mm Macro just owns that spot ) \n\n Notice that there is a big cap in higher than 100mm, that is because  Pentax does not have good enough auto focus for me to focus on that kind  of photography, so that is a area I'm interested in but not my main  focus. As I said I mostly shoot people and need my gear to focus on that  but having the options is fun.\n\nSo for the Sony talk. I'm trading all my gear away, I will get Sony A7 R IV and then I have some Sigma options. \n\nThe option I'm debating on is getting \n\nSigma 105mm 1.4 Art and with it Sigma 35mm 1.4 Art   \n vs   \n Sigma 24-70mm 2.8 and with it Sigma 35mm 1.4 Art.\n\nAfter this debate I'm ready to spend 4000-6000$ to finish the lens setup. \n\n So my thoughts it that 105 1.4 is a holy grail lens for me but I'm  still wondering if it is worth having as I will always need a macro lens  also and the 90mm Macro seams to stand out for Sony and I think I will  then mostly leave my 105mm at home and take the 90mm instead. I would  love to fit the 105mm into the line up but I don't want it to be forced  there just to have it. \n\n24-70 Sigma on the other hand is getting a  really good reviews but auto focus is a tad slower in tests than the  Sony 24-70 2.8. When I use primes I don\u00b4t depend on auto focus a lot but  in this Zoom I want it to be fast and good. Coming from Pentax I think I  will be happy with either choice.\n\nSo when I have made this choice the world opens up and I need to fill my bag \ud83d\udcf7:) \n\nSo areas we need to cover In rank of importance.  \n \\- Portrait   \n \\- Fashion   \n \\- Weddings   \n \\- Products Macro   \n \\- Landscapes and aurora \n\nNice to have would be   \n Event and Concerts   \n Sports and Wildlife \n\n First lens I want to ask about is the Sony 90mm Macro is there a good  alternative ? Is there some other lens that does a great macro job but  is maybe 50-70mm as that gives me a better room for the 105mm ? \n\nIf I choose the 105mm Sigma I will need to buy a 24-70 lens I guess the Sony 2.8 here is a no brainer ? \n\n Otherwise if I choose the 24-70 Sigma Art then I will have to choose a  portrait lens, something that will not be to close with the macro so if  the Macro lens is 90mm I'm not going with a 85mm lens then I'm looking  more into 135mm or 50mm ( Also thinking the 50mm might be nice to have  for video ) The33 Sony 135mm 1.8 is interesting here or the Sigma 135. \n\nSo if I have the setup   \n Macro lens   \n Portrait lens ( long )  \n 24-70  \n 35 art lens \n\n Maybe money is better spent adding a 50mm or something that will  increase depth of lenses for people photography. Otherwise I'm looking  at 100-400 or some nice 70-200mm to open up that area. \n\nSo here  are my thoughts, so for the long read this is just a whole lot of  options for someone coming out of Pentax and I want to do my research  and do this right.

They have fairly similar reproduction ratios, with the [24-105 pulling just ahead](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1369442-REG/sony_sel24105g_fe_24_105mm_f_4_g.html/specs) at 0.31x to the [Batis' 0.3x](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1436738-REG/zeiss_000000_2239_137_batis_40mm_f_2_cf.html/specs) magnification. The reason I thought this comparison had some merit was because they're both trying to be 'the minivan' in different ways, and both are things you might consider taking outdoors for a walkabout and in the process grab some impromptu shots of flowers and insects. \n\nWith that said, let's have a look at the scene:\n\n[Batis 40 f11](https://preview.redd.it/o354osolh9941.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf3e3a021b0e07e2842396e75ca457e270a5d0f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[24-105g f11](https://preview.redd.it/zyk34roih9941.jpg?width=2875&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26780bb8f468fb06f13586fa086896cf7802c4ec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, both lenses do a pretty good job. I'm a little more impressed by the zoom honestly, as it has the much more complex design and difficult job. That being said, even without pixel peeping the Batis has an advantage when it comes to large scale contrast and color reproduction\u2014however I'm not sure it's significant enough that I'd be able to tell if the images weren't side by side. To be clear, I did nothing to these images after capture other than import them to Capture One express and convert them to jpeg. All default settings were used. Before we get into some pretty heavy crop comparisons, let's get a few things out of the way. \n\n1. Due to the Batis having both a wider focal length *and* a lower magnification, I expect it to have more depth of field than the 24-105 at every magnification. This will be an advantage in the field if the G zoom doesn't provide superior resolution with its extra 0.01x magnification (unlikely to be significant, even if the 24-105 is very good.).\n2. While I may have alluded to it before, I am explicitly expecting the Batis to perform better here based on two facts. The first is that they are similarly priced lenses with one being a prime and one being a zoom. Primes being simpler to manufacture and design are usually optically superior to same generation zooms. Secondly, the Batis is already stopped down twice just to get even with the 24-105's aperture wide open. This should also deliver a better performance. \n3. The body used was an a7iii, locked down on a tripod for all comparison shots. ISO was set to 100, and with each change in aperture I adjusted the shutter speed until I metered 0 EV on a -2\u2014+2 scale. This comparison was a little imperfect in the setup, as I don't have a macro slider on me and had to manually move the tripod on carpet to get to my focus point. I managed to get my focus point for both lenses under a centimeter apart from each other, but they are not focused on the exact same spot. Still, the focus points are close enough to be within my 400% crop so I don't think this comparison is completely invalidated. \n\nLet's get going on the crops. Starting with center crops. \n\n[Batis 40 f4](https://preview.redd.it/8t5mox9qm9941.jpg?width=577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=024e6704b8a0e4c672bb3712e21b78ead82149c8)\n\n[24-105 f4](https://preview.redd.it/290llm1wm9941.jpg?width=584&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74cebd4fa02eb41269127682851ac49cab99454f)\n\n[Batis 40 f5.6](https://preview.redd.it/mn1sjt93n9941.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b40478226599a8b05da4d422424b5c1f39ddec67)\n\n[24-105 f5.6](https://preview.redd.it/ibcgjiy5n9941.jpg?width=548&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836487df67353469a1d75d5ba0fc37b41993a10e)\n\n[Batis 40 f11](https://preview.redd.it/bvcbswj9n9941.jpg?width=543&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29c0f4ed6197f6583a6c26c781d39467da727190)\n\n[24-105 f11](https://preview.redd.it/8bhl87ven9941.jpg?width=546&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f05c6b6354181ef95e46e7258db5f6c8015e78)\n\n*Processing img ohkqs89in9941...*\n\n[24-105 f16](https://preview.redd.it/yzhgr8wkn9941.jpg?width=546&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34226a98d7816df1ef64f7bb007a65b24aeeb98f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, a few things to take away here. \n\n1. The Batis lens has levels of fine (or micro, if you will) contrast that surpass the zoom at every aperture. This isn't too surprising, as higher element counts lead to lower contrast ratios usually. See [this article](http://www.dslrbodies.com/lenses/lens-articles/what-is-micro-contrast.html) for further reading.\n2. Resolution on the Batis appears to be higher at every aperture as well. As stated earlier, this is the expected result. \n3. Both lenses seem to start getting diffraction limited on f16. \n4. Also as expected: the Batis seems to have greater depth of field at every aperture. \n\nLet's look a bit off center, to see how the DOF and IQ extend a bit away from the center. This will be the last comparison, as this scene has a lot of depth and any kind of corner crop would require focus stacking.\n\n[Batis 40 f11](https://preview.redd.it/cn85v3zgs9941.jpg?width=544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac8d5bdecb7721326d371c5a00581753dde3d560)\n\n[24-105 f11](https://preview.redd.it/juath58ls9941.jpg?width=557&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e80ff54861189969d0fe6a9deae9544a6bad81db)\n\n[Batis 40 f16](https://preview.redd.it/uldltyvps9941.jpg?width=544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=381f00a64d8e6bdd83ddb44f2e3ff2e7c39a991a)\n\n[24-105 f16](https://preview.redd.it/bsp31cyrs9941.jpg?width=557&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718c4514283a701673e5b444cdb64c144b06c794)\n\n[Batis 40 f16](https://preview.redd.it/2p12617us9941.jpg?width=547&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a43a6cca1084d0bbc272a97cdd45c8f3342b3d0)\n\n[24-105 f16](https://preview.redd.it/v467l5wkt9941.jpg?width=542&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e792604b2fca5728cf368bfe8d066135213e080)\n\nAs we can see, off center it's a bit more of the same. Using the leaf edge and bodies as crops shows that the Batis 40 performs better with a greater depth of field. \n\nWith this comparison we can see that the 40 is as expected: the superior lens in terms of close focus performance.

By that time, my interests were mostly travel-related to include city/street photography, landscape (think mountains/beaches) and architecture (churches, buildings, etc). This camera won me over mostly on its compact size which was very nice for travel (I've always been a one-bag, carry-only only sort of traveler). And of course it really does make a nice photograph.\n\nSo with my background out of the way, the A7III caught my eye when it was released and seemed like a body right in the sweet spot of cost/performance. I don't do much if any video and it seems that run 2020, this is still a good match for me.\n\nI think I've decided I'm going to start off with a single prime lens. I've made this decision after the realization that on my RX100 I very rarely ever use the zoom. I find myself typically zoomed all the way out, and if I don't like the framing or composition, I will move closer if I can or perhaps do some cropping in Capture One.\n\nThere is a bunch of buzz around the Sigma 40mm ART lens and while impressive, I think it is too heavy and unwieldy for the sort of uses I have in mind and the amount of travel I try to do (though 2020 is likely going to be a dud :( ). I took a close look at Sony prime GM lenses with E-mount for the A7III and I guess I'm just trying to decide which direction to go.\n\nThe 24mm f/1.4 seems like a ridiculously good lens that is a good compromise for my typical uses. For mountains or landscapes, the wide angle is adequate if not good. And for street use, you typically have to fiddle with your position, but I've seen some great images online. Finally, the f/1.4 will be nice for low-light scenarios -- think old churches/cathedrals I might visit on my travels. That's a challenge for me now. I generally don't use flash in that setting, permitted or not.\n\nBut then there's the cost. Technically, this in my budget, but I can't help but wonder: given what I've described, would I be better served by the Sony 20mm G-Lens, not G-Master (is that right?? I'm not familiar with all the lens quality levels yet) f/1.8 and I also see Sony has an f/2.8 16mm (non G-anything model) combined with their 35mm (non G-anything) lens for street type of images?\n\nThere is a lot here, I realize. I'm happy to hear from anyone who has made a similar journey in thought and learn what you eventually decided and why. If I can provide any more background to help you help me, please let me know.\n\nAlso, it seems that none of these components are significantly discounted at any place that sells them - Amazon, Adorama, etc. all have this stuff for about the same price. I bought my RX100 from Amazon, but can someone tell me any advantages from buying from a more camera-specific dealer online?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/gdfeoa/help_with_prime_lens_selection_for_a_new_a7iii/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "help with prime lens selection for a new a7iii /!/ good day all. i'm new to this community but not new to photography. just in terms of my background, i'm not a pro, but it's a hobby. i got my first film camera back in 1989, a konica fc-1. then in the mid-1990s, i got a used olympus om-10 and then a second one a couple years later. i had a few different lenses over the years for them, and i used my om-10s up until 2014. i gave my film camera to my nephews last year.\n\nat this point, i skipped right over dslr and on the advice of a friend, took a look at the sony rx100ii. by that time, my interests were mostly travel-related to include city/street photography, landscape (think mountains/beaches) and architecture (churches, buildings, etc). this camera won me over mostly on its compact size which was very nice for travel (i've always been a one-bag, carry-only only sort of traveler). and of course it really does make a nice photograph.\n\nso with my background out of the way, the a7iii caught my eye when it was released and seemed like a body right in the sweet -----> spot !!!  of cost/performance. i don't do much if any video and it seems that run 2020, this is still a good match for me.\n\ni think i've decided i'm going to start off with a single prime lens. i've made this decision after the realization that on my rx100 i very rarely ever use the zoom. i find myself typically zoomed all the way out, and if i don't like the framing or composition, i will move closer if i can or perhaps do some cropping in capture one.\n\nthere is a bunch of buzz around the sigma 40mm art lens and while impressive, i think it is too heavy and unwieldy for the sort of uses i have in mind and the amount of travel i try to do (though 2020 is likely going to be a dud :( ). i took a close look at sony prime gm lenses with e-mount for the a7iii and i guess i'm just trying to decide which direction to go.\n\nthe 24mm f/1.4 seems like a ridiculously good lens that is a good compromise for my typical uses. for mountains or landscapes, the wide angle is adequate if not good. and for street use, you typically have to fiddle with your position, but i've seen some great images online. finally, the f/1.4 will be nice for low-light scenarios -- think old churches/cathedrals i might visit on my travels. that's a challenge for me now. i generally don't use flash in that setting, permitted or not.\n\nbut then there's the cost. technically, this in my budget, but i can't help but wonder: given what i've described, would i be better served by the sony 20mm g-lens, not g-master (is that right?? i'm not familiar with all the lens quality levels yet) f/1.8 and i also see sony has an f/2.8 16mm (non g-anything model) combined with their 35mm (non g-anything) lens for street type of images?\n\nthere is a lot here, i realize. i'm happy to hear from anyone who has made a similar journey in thought and learn what you eventually decided and why. if i can provide any more background to help you help me, please let me know.\n\nalso, it seems that none of these components are significantly discounted at any place that sells them - amazon, adorama, etc. all have this stuff for about the same price. i bought my rx100 from amazon, but can someone tell me any advantages from buying from a more camera-specific dealer online?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 36507, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 35984, "autor": "Jdsd77", "date": 1581539803000, "content": "Hollywood Nights!
