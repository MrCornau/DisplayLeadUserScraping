SLog on 8-bit camera? /!/ I was really pumped to use some logs and experiment with picture profiles when I learned of their benefit. I shoot on an a6400 and after my first event I have ever filmed I had some grain in my low light shots that I wasn't pumped about.  So I researched for a few days on low light shooting and picture profiles, how they affect dynamic range capture etc. I was excited to start experimenting and learning hands-on but I was then later told by different people, shooting in Slog on an 8-bit camera was pointless, and it would do more damage to the footage in post when grading than flexibility and dynamic range gained. Can someone sort me out on how I should be shooting on my 6400 to have the highest dynamic range? Are picture profiles useful? Is one better at darks, is another better at preserving details in light areas etc? Id love to learn a bit more from the community and learn any tricks/tools in different picture profiles.
