But I'm still confused. Some video use lots of light. Literally bright. Then reduce ISO. Some video teach to turn off all your light, etc. \nDo I need a lot of light then play around with my iso/aperture to 'darken' the video? Or turn the light off, use minimal light source and have a lens for low light? Now, my mirrorless camera is on its way. I don't have it on me to test. But I am already throwing out cash, impulse buying all these low aperture lenses. Because I wanna shoot in 'low light' dark environment in my room. Any tips and advice? I have 2 rectangular softbox (non variable wattage) so there are 2 powerful light source I have in hand. \n\nI know some might think, the answer is already there in my post. That, I can just follow whatever method I saw online.\nTo that, I should add that, my gear will be Sony ZV-E10, and the lens I have is the kitlens 18mm-50mm and Sigma 30mm f1.4 and gonna buy Sigma 16mm f1.4.\n\nJust because everyone bought it. And it is for 'low light'\n\nI appreciate any advice.
