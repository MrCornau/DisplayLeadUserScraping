Will the problem get worse? /!/ Hey all,\n\nI had a bit of a mishap recently - I was using my a6000 on a flight and when I packed the camera back in my bag towards the end of the flight I must have jolted it. The camera got switched on and the lens wasn't fully attached so it stayed switched on stuck on the \"please attach lens\" screen. It was left in my bag like this for a few hours until I arrived at my hotel. By the time I took it out of my bag it was hot to the touch and almost out of power.\n\nI left the camera to cool then turned it on to check and while most of it seems fine, there's a permanent white spot on my sensor that shows up both in the viewfinder and on photos. I know it is on the sensor as it is always outlined when focus peaking is turned on.\n\nI haven't seen anyone online describe anything similar, so I am not sure how much of a problem this could be. It looks quite small right now, but I worry it could get worse in the future.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this is and if there is any way I can fix or minimise the issue?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this post.
