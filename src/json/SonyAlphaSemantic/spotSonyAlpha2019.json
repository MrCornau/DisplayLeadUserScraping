You wonder why there are no in-depth A6100 reviews anywhere? Because all the idiots just keep on making the same assumption it's an a6400 with some higher end features removed. It's not.\n\nReasons I returned this POS.\n\n1. Half the settings are gone in the menu. Including the most basic thing of all in 2019, a minimum shutter for auto ISO. This is a $750 camera. It's not a $200 point and shoot.\n2. Screen is taken from a Nintendo DS from 15 years ago. It's the same one from the A6000. Absolute shame on a $750 device. It's even smaller than other 3\" screens since it's 16:9 so its squat. I'd imagine the sRGB coverage is 40% or some low ass number and the contrast is 1:200.\n3. The white balance sucks ass in artificial lighting. All my images turned out green under this outdoor lamp that was not green. Not just a green tint. The whole image was green. Went to another light. Now it's ORANGE. Maybe I would have known the white balance was this bad if the screen wasn't washed out junk. Both my phone and the canon g7x were doing significantly better.\n4. I was fine with the kit lens on the A6000 until I wanted something that was sharper. The only fast prime with OSS is the 35mm f/1.8. It's equivalent to a 52mm. Actually even more narrow since I compared the 52mm on my canon and my phone's 2x zoom which is 52mm and they were both wider. Every idiot on the web brags about how great this lens is for street photography or walking around. What a joke. There's a serious medical condition called retinities pigmentosa where your vision gradually narrows until you can't see anything wider than a straw. This is late stage retinitis pigmentosa. I point it across the street and all I can see is the front door of a building. If you want a zoomed in portrait of someone's face and nothing else, sure. It's a joke for everything else. Dear god was it awful for video. The OSS is a complete joke. Even at 1/30 it was blurring. I had to set it to 1/60, which meant my ISO shot up to 12800. What's the point of such a large sensor if the glass and the stabilization for that glass is shit? Pay twice as much for an A6600 for maybe one extra stop of difference? Because the a6600 IBIS is awful as well. Pocket cameras like the canon g5x ii and g7x iii as well as any modern phone with optical stabilization are leagues ahead with fast glass and stabilization. My phone automatically shoots 1/10 for almost all my low light shots. The canon I've set to 1/15 without issue. It also has a real minimum shutter setting, so I don't have to worry when it gets brighter. Did I also mention they all focus way closer than ONE FOOT away?\n5. Crap low light focus. The focus is amazing they say. It can track animal and human eyes they say. It's the best and most advanced focusing system on any camera they say. On a still subject (a cat) from three feet away it can't focus for shit. It wasn't pitch black. I could see the cat well and good. There was a light directly above. Blur after blur after blur. Multiple attempts and multiple autofocus fails. My phone had zero issue in the same spot. My canon would hunt and flutter for a second or two but it would eventually find it. The hybrid and phase detect most advanced focusing system on the planet can't even compete against basic contrast focus used on most budget point and shoot cameras. Ditto even a cheap cellphone.\n6. Loud as f\\*ck shutter. I know most of you are old and deaf but even being deaf, you can at least feel the loud shutter through the strong vibrations. I thought they would have improved it over the A6000. Nope. Every living thing from a one block radius will run when it hears that death contraption. Here is a list of APSC cameras with far quieter shutters I've used: Canon M100, Fuji X-A5, Fuji XF10, Canon M6, Ricoh GR3. Most of these are cheaper than the Sony. You can't use price as an excuse. They are also smaller so you can't use size either. My canon G7x just flutters like a small bird. That's it. Turn on electronic shutter? Why not just use a cellphone in other words.\n7. Sony's still asinine playback options. Not that I want to use the subpar screen for literally anything beyond framing, but even trying to weed out bad images from the camera itself is a chore with zero touch functionality and not even a zoom lever. Speaking of zoom lever...\n8. Instead of a zoom lever they have a worthless on/off switch that's near impossible to figure out which way is which and never flips properly or decisively, is hard to push and has no feedback. I've had multiple occasions where the a6000 would get stuck and never turn off even though the switch was set to OFF. I'd imagine the A6100 is going to go through the same crap since it uses the exact same switch. Five years worth of progress. Beautiful. And the worst placed dials on any camera. Let's put the mode dial and custom dial right next to each other and have them be the same size and feel instead of staggering them and changing the size or texture like every other camera out there. They also downgraded the I/O flap. It's a thin piece of plastic that slides into place instead of a thick well hinged door.\n9. I liked the grip on the A6000. The A6100 feels like it's fat cancerous brother. Not just the grip, but the whole body in general. You would have to be blind to mistake the two side by side. The main body is significantly thicker and fatter and clumsier. They increased the bulk of the grip but didn't spread it far enough away from the lens and it barely juts out from the thicker body. The a6000 actually jutted out more and had more space where you put your fingers. It feels constrained and unpleasant. What did you gain from the 50g of extra weight, a whopping 10mm or more extra thickness in the main body, and a shittier grip? A screen that can do selfies and 4k with no guarantee of record length. Sure as hell didn't gain anything else.\n\nDpreview said this camera was a great family camera. I can't imagine any normal consumer would actually use this over a cellphone or pocket camera zoom like the g7x. And with the latest report from CIPA showing \\~25% decline in camera sales from last year, which is considered \"less\" than previous declines, I am hoping this whole worthless APSC segment will finally die. It's not small enough or better quality enough to warrant considering for a normal person. And considering how Sony is just recycling the same shit but making it worse, they obviously don't care about their APSC line and neither should anyone else. The camera market outside of professional full frame users is basically dead since Sony and others keep on releasing these shit products.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/dwqzwg/sony_a6100_wasted_my_time_trusting_stupid_people/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "sony a6100. wasted my time trusting stupid people online. /!/ i shoot in low light. i had an a6000 prior. wanted something pocketable. got a canon g7x iii. was miffed at the slow contrast focus. upgraded the a6000 to the a6100 because everyone and their mother online, including this worthless subreddit, said it was identical to the a6400 except for s.log, 4k recording time, and evf, none of which i use or care about. you wonder why there are no in-depth a6100 reviews anywhere?

Put a proper grip in there, and ... with larger lens I hold the lens anyway with my other arm, or have to use tripod if it gets that heavy (I do not own any large enough lens to really have to use trippod though).  The a6500 series is approx 70mm high ... typical human hand 4 fingers side by side is approx 70 .. 85 mm, meaning that with a larger hand pinky might be left over and go under the camera. Throw in a battery grip (optional) for XXL hands. \n* Does not fit in such a small box ... but .. its not THAT much larger than APS-C, basically saw off the centrally placed EVF on top of the A7 series and you are left with a6500 size box.
