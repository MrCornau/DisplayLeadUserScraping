There's many reason for this. There's too many anti-maskers in my area to go out in the day time, and my boyfriend can't stand waiting around while I mess with a tripod. I don't love the look of flash, and it's conspicuous on the street. \n\nI wanted to share some of the things I've learned after 9 rolls of film shooting this way. Some people reading this may have more experience than me, and if you do, please correct me where I err and let me know any tips you have, I want to hear. But I know that a lot of photographers avoid shooting this way or don't think it's possible, and there's not an overwhelming amount of information out there about it, so I just wanna offer my perspective, green though it may be.\n\n# Light\n\nLight at night is water in the desert; you have to do everything you can to get it. You have to create a configuration that will soak up light with voracious greed. Big lens, fast film. I use an F 1.4 lens, and Kodak P3200 T-Max and occasionally Ilford Delta 3200. I am experimenting with pushing Portra 800 but I haven't gotten the results back yet so I can't comment on how well it works. A lot of people prefer Delta over T-Max for its midtones, and I think in brighter conditions, they have a strong point. But in very dark conditions, the T-Max really shines. More than just dramatic contrast, it gives things a silvery look I really like, and has a crisp quality in spite of the grain. Plus, I don't necessarily love what happens when you goose the contrast of a Delta photo in post. I say let it be what it is; a beautiful low contrast stock. But I digress. \n\nPart of why you want this level of light gathering ability is so that you don't \"bottom out\" in your exposure. Lenses perform better when they're stopped down at least a little. Shooting anything other than wide-open in these conditions may sound ridiculous, but since focusing in the dark is really difficult and you're moving quickly, a super slim depth-of-field isn't always what you want. The true strength of a 1.4 lens isn't that it opens to 1.4, it's how it looks at F2 compared to an F2 lens. \n\nAlso, you will often want the option to over-expose. Both of these films are fast, but hungry. They are quite happy to eat up some extra light. Attempting to over-expose at night with no flash may sound greedy, but that's what you need to be. \n\nAs I'll go into later, dynamic range can be really high in night scenes. A slower setup might tell you that you're good to click, but the results may disappoint. So you need a buffer, some extra speed in your setup that you don't always need.. \n\n# Film Speed of 3200 Stocks\n\nA lot of people on analog subs like to say that T-Max P3200 and Delta 3200 aren't *really* 3200 speed films. They will tell you that they have ISO ratings of 1600 or lower, so they need to be rated as such. They are correct about the ISO rating, but they are not correct that that means you have to rate the film slower to take good pictures. The ISO rating is a measurement of how the film responds on certain tests, but it is not determined by the taking of pictures, so the ISO rating doesn't necessarily tell you what will look best. Plus, Kodak are trying to give you a clue as to how to use their film. The P in P3200 T-Max stands for \"push\", meaning that *normal* development for this film is technically pushing. But since it's designed to be used that way, it works really well. \n\nI always rate T-Max P3200 at 3200 ISO. Delta 3200 I will rate slower if I'm going to be in brighter light conditions, just because of the lower contrast. Over-exposing Delta 3200 produces a soft, dreamy look imo. But it works perfectly well rated at 3200 for night shoots. \n\n[1.4 Lens, T-Max P3200 at box speed, 1.5 stops of compensation](https://preview.redd.it/uzoyydtqy9e61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def36b163ecb3139803407b7e9beb85bb85167b9)\n\n# Prioritize Shutter Speed\n\nShooting handheld means using a fast shutter speed, but shooting in low light means using the slowest shutter speed you can get away with. These two competing forces mean that there's almost never a reason to use a shutter speed besides the minimum dictated by your lens's focal length. \n\nLonger focal lengths exaggerate handheld shake, shorter focal lengths forgive it more. For the nifty fifty, that means you should never shoot slower than 1/50th of a second.\n\nThe closest setting on my trusty K1000 is 1/60th, so I set it there and leave it there the whole night. All that cash you shelled out on a big lens and ultra-fast films has been to bring this magic number within reach, because this number is the difference between getting the shot, and needing to go home and get a tripod. \n\n(I say \"all that cash\", but fast 50mm prime lenses are fairly affordable.)\n\nOn my K1000, I shoot in de facto shutter priority. And I've begun experimenting with a Canon EOS that has real shutter priority mode. Experience has shown me that a nighttime walk-and-shoot will never give me enough light to justify speeding up the shutter, nor stopping the lens down further than about F4. Plus, if I attempt aperture priority, the risk of the shutter speed dipping below the minimum without me realizing it is too great. So I park it at 60 and go. \n\nIf you're about to do your first ever night shooting, avoid the temptation to speed up the shutter for the sake of bokeh / depth of field. Focusing in low-light is difficult for people and cameras alike. Plus, extreme DOF blur that can look dreamy in the daytime can look muddy in the night time. \n\n[High speed film and shutter priority enabled a wider depth of field](https://preview.redd.it/08ocppkcdae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01b6c71e553f4e18e4f2dd75b2b6c0a62997287d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Compensation\n\nA really fun way to compose pictures at night is to include the light source in the picture. Street lights, shop lights, car headlights, and so on. But this can confuse camera meters, which may attempt to treat the light source as a highlight and try not to blow it out. The result of this is often pictures which have little pin-pricks of light and not much else. Both my K1000 with it's pseudo-averaging and my EOS with it's Evaluative metering behave very similarly at night. Any bright light source will freak the meter out and cause it to under-expose. \n\nSome people are comfortable framing up a scene and then estimating a compensation, but I'm not, so here's what I do:\n\nWith my K1000's match-needle meter, I will aim at my scene, and then aim away until the lights are no longer in the frame, but the area lit by that light still is. At that point, the needle will usually drop significantly. I then set the exposure so that the needle is right down the middle, and then re-frame my composition. The needle will jump up and act like I'm about to over-expose, but it's safe to ignore it. My K1000 is recently calibrated, so you'll need to apply this to what you know about your own camera.\n\nWith my EOS 500, you can technically do the same thing, but it's pretty inconvenient outside of manual mode. Thankfully it has a button on the back that converts from evaluative metering to spot metering. I have tested these techniques on the cameras side-by-side, and the spot-meter button gives the exact same exposure compensation as the look-away method on my K1000 almost every time. \n\n[I exposed this shot exactly as my K1000 suggested, but it was confused by the lights](https://preview.redd.it/1xb60r6o4ae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad40f03926426dc5129cc0a1e748038e7d894a5d)\n\n*Processing img rx79g6lo4ae61...*\n\nWhen in doubt, you can always double-check with a phone app meter. Generally speaking my phone-app meter gives me the same result as these compensation tricks, but obviously you don't wanna be taking out your phone for every shot, you're shooting handheld for speed, right? \n\n# Pushing\n\nYou may not feel like using 3200 speed black and white film. They are slightly more expensive than their 400 speed cousins (though not quite as expensive as Portra) or maybe you want to give this a try using the film you have. When film is pushed, it gets grainier, grittier, and more contrasty. There's not really a way around it. But personally, I like that look, it's a huge reason why I shoot film in the first place. Subconsciously I'm just trying to make the movie Alphaville. \n\nIf you're not familiar, pushing film is a combination of under-exposing and over-developing. You set your meter ISO to the desired speed, and then let your lab know how many stops you \"pushed\" by, and they compensate in development (or you can compensate in your own development, but if you home develop you probably already know all this) \n\nThis is distinct from *rating,* though the terms get tossed around. When you *rate* film, you're just treating the film as if it has a different speed and then developing normally. This is quite commonly done with Portra 400, which people will rate at 200 to feed it more light. But they do not change the development. \n\nWith that out of the way, pushed 400 film behaves fairly similarly to fast film. Higher contrast, more grain, but still quite eager for light. Everything else I've said applies. Maybe a little less tolerance for underexposure, a little less shadow detail. But a totally viable option. \n\n[Kodak Tri-X pushed allllll the way to 3200](https://preview.redd.it/80gryeh18ae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c40ba1f236e9c834d9fee8a08d7079b31861fafa)\n\nThese are the things I have learned about shooting in these tricky circumstances. I hope it helps someone who's considering trying it out, and if you have anything to offer that might help me improve, please don't hold back!", "title": "Shooting Handheld at Night (without flash)", "num-comments": 23, "score": 1, "date": "2021-01-29 15:23:18", "content": "Shooting Handheld at Night (without flash) /!/ Since I've gotten into film photography, almost all of my photography has been handheld at night on my Pentax K1000 with no flash. There's many reason for this. There's too many anti-maskers in my area to go out in the day time, and my boyfriend can't stand waiting around while I mess with a tripod. I don't love the look of flash, and it's conspicuous on the street. \n\nI wanted to share some of the things I've learned after 9 rolls of film shooting this way. Some people reading this may have more experience than me, and if you do, please correct me where I err and let me know any tips you have, I want to hear. But I know that a lot of photographers avoid shooting this way or don't think it's possible, and there's not an overwhelming amount of information out there about it, so I just wanna offer my perspective, green though it may be.\n\n# Light\n\nLight at night is water in the desert; you have to do everything you can to get it. You have to create a configuration that will soak up light with voracious greed. Big lens, fast film. I use an F 1.4 lens, and Kodak P3200 T-Max and occasionally Ilford Delta 3200. I am experimenting with pushing Portra 800 but I haven't gotten the results back yet so I can't comment on how well it works. A lot of people prefer Delta over T-Max for its midtones, and I think in brighter conditions, they have a strong point. But in very dark conditions, the T-Max really shines. More than just dramatic contrast, it gives things a silvery look I really like, and has a crisp quality in spite of the grain. Plus, I don't necessarily love what happens when you goose the contrast of a Delta photo in post. I say let it be what it is; a beautiful low contrast stock. But I digress. \n\nPart of why you want this level of light gathering ability is so that you don't \"bottom out\" in your exposure. Lenses perform better when they're stopped down at least a little. Shooting anything other than wide-open in these conditions may sound ridiculous, but since focusing in the dark is really difficult and you're moving quickly, a super slim depth-of-field isn't always what you want. The true strength of a 1.4 lens isn't that it opens to 1.4, it's how it looks at F2 compared to an F2 lens. \n\nAlso, you will often want the option to over-expose. Both of these films are fast, but hungry. They are quite happy to eat up some extra light. Attempting to over-expose at night with no flash may sound greedy, but that's what you need to be. \n\nAs I'll go into later, dynamic range can be really high in night scenes. A slower setup might tell you that you're good to click, but the results may disappoint. So you need a buffer, some extra speed in your setup that you don't always need.. \n\n# Film Speed of 3200 Stocks\n\nA lot of people on analog subs like to say that T-Max P3200 and Delta 3200 aren't *really* 3200 speed films. They will tell you that they have ISO ratings of 1600 or lower, so they need to be rated as such. They are correct about the ISO rating, but they are not correct that that means you have to rate the film slower to take good pictures. The ISO rating is a measurement of how the film responds on certain tests, but it is not determined by the taking of pictures, so the ISO rating doesn't necessarily tell you what will look best. Plus, Kodak are trying to give you a clue as to how to use their film. The P in P3200 T-Max stands for \"push\", meaning that *normal* development for this film is technically pushing. But since it's designed to be used that way, it works really well. \n\nI always rate T-Max P3200 at 3200 ISO. Delta 3200 I will rate slower if I'm going to be in brighter light conditions, just because of the lower contrast. Over-exposing Delta 3200 produces a soft, dreamy look imo. But it works perfectly well rated at 3200 for night shoots. \n\n[1.4 Lens, T-Max P3200 at box speed, 1.5 stops of compensation](https://preview.redd.it/uzoyydtqy9e61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def36b163ecb3139803407b7e9beb85bb85167b9)\n\n# Prioritize Shutter Speed\n\nShooting handheld means using a fast shutter speed, but shooting in low light means using the slowest shutter speed you can get away with. These two competing forces mean that there's almost never a reason to use a shutter speed besides the minimum dictated by your lens's focal length. \n\nLonger focal lengths exaggerate handheld shake, shorter focal lengths forgive it more. For the nifty fifty, that means you should never shoot slower than 1/50th of a second.\n\nThe closest setting on my trusty K1000 is 1/60th, so I set it there and leave it there the whole night. All that cash you shelled out on a big lens and ultra-fast films has been to bring this magic number within reach, because this number is the difference between getting the shot, and needing to go home and get a tripod. \n\n(I say \"all that cash\", but fast 50mm prime lenses are fairly affordable.)\n\nOn my K1000, I shoot in de facto shutter priority. And I've begun experimenting with a Canon EOS that has real shutter priority mode. Experience has shown me that a nighttime walk-and-shoot will never give me enough light to justify speeding up the shutter, nor stopping the lens down further than about F4. Plus, if I attempt aperture priority, the risk of the shutter speed dipping below the minimum without me realizing it is too great. So I park it at 60 and go. \n\nIf you're about to do your first ever night shooting, avoid the temptation to speed up the shutter for the sake of bokeh / depth of field. Focusing in low-light is difficult for people and cameras alike. Plus, extreme DOF blur that can look dreamy in the daytime can look muddy in the night time. \n\n[High speed film and shutter priority enabled a wider depth of field](https://preview.redd.it/08ocppkcdae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01b6c71e553f4e18e4f2dd75b2b6c0a62997287d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Compensation\n\nA really fun way to compose pictures at night is to include the light source in the picture. Street lights, shop lights, car headlights, and so on. But this can confuse camera meters, which may attempt to treat the light source as a highlight and try not to blow it out. The result of this is often pictures which have little pin-pricks of light and not much else. Both my K1000 with it's pseudo-averaging and my EOS with it's Evaluative metering behave very similarly at night. Any bright light source will freak the meter out and cause it to under-expose. \n\nSome people are comfortable framing up a scene and then estimating a compensation, but I'm not, so here's what I do:\n\nWith my K1000's match-needle meter, I will aim at my scene, and then aim away until the lights are no longer in the frame, but the area lit by that light still is. At that point, the needle will usually drop significantly. I then set the exposure so that the needle is right down the middle, and then re-frame my composition. The needle will jump up and act like I'm about to over-expose, but it's safe to ignore it. My K1000 is recently calibrated, so you'll need to apply this to what you know about your own camera.\n\nWith my EOS 500, you can technically do the same thing, but it's pretty inconvenient outside of manual mode. Thankfully it has a button on the back that converts from evaluative metering to spot metering. I have tested these techniques on the cameras side-by-side, and the spot-meter button gives the exact same exposure compensation as the look-away method on my K1000 almost every time. \n\n[I exposed this shot exactly as my K1000 suggested, but it was confused by the lights](https://preview.redd.it/1xb60r6o4ae61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad40f03926426dc5129cc0a1e748038e7d894a5d)\n\n*Processing img rx79g6lo4ae61...*\n\nWhen in doubt, you can always double-check with a phone app meter. Generally speaking my phone-app meter gives me the same result as these compensation tricks, but obviously you don't wanna be taking out your phone for every shot, you're shooting handheld for speed, right? \n\n# Pushing\n\nYou may not feel like using 3200 speed black and white film. They are slightly more expensive than their 400 speed cousins (though not quite as expensive as Portra) or maybe you want to give this a try using the film you have. When film is pushed, it gets grainier, grittier, and more contrasty. There's not really a way around it. But personally, I like that look, it's a huge reason why I shoot film in the first place.

In 120 I got some FP4+ and TriX, but also have other bw film.\n\nThe problem is that while Adox says the kit can be used to develop any BW film, they only say the times and temperatures for the scala and cms films. \n\nThis leaves -----> me !!!  wondering how can -----> I develop !!!  the orher rolls of film?

Initially I was having difficulty getting it to start but managed to get past that ok with cleaning and trimming the leader properly, but once the film gets about 10-15cm into the reel (a decent length past the bearings) one of the bearings jams and kicks the film edge out of the reel and I have to start over. Since the bearings feed fine for the first bit, and I can feel the film feeding straight even as the bearing locks up and starts twisting the film out, I can't figure out what's causing this, other than maybe the film itself being sticky from 2 hours of accumulated humidity in the dark bag. Thing is I can't think of a way to fix this, or why it would have happened since i got around the initial problems fairly quickly. Does anyone have any ideas for how to make my brand new Patterson reels work?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/kv46g2/need_some_help_getting_patterson_reels_to_feed/"}, {"autor": "GlobnarTheExquisite", "selftext": "nan", "title": "Six weeks ago I'd never shot a single photo, today I developed a roll I shot and didn't screw it up!

And I really don\u2019t want to hold their hand when nobody held mine. They suddenly find out that getting film developed costs money.
