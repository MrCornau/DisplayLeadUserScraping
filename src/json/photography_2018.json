My name is Simon Duvenage, and I am absolutely CRAZY about photography! Currently photography is only a hobby, but I hope one day I will be able to do it as a full-time or part-time job. I have been shooting on a Nikon Coolpix P500 bridge camera for the past couple of years, so I have been saving up to buy my first DSLR because I know that will be quite a big step up from my current setup, and I have no family or friends that have a DSLR that I could borrow. So anyways, a couple of weeks ago, as part of my birthday present my parents decided to help me buy a second hand Canon 800D (T7i for those in the US). So, unfortunately, it turns out it was a scam and the seller disappeared with all my money and never sent me my camera. So now I'm left with a burning passion for photography, and almost no money to finance it.

I don\u2019t know if I can improve. Let me explain what I mean. \n\nI bought my first dslr in 2014. I was shooting a lot back then but I never really liked the pictures. I had some good colour photos but I recognised they were good because of the pretty colours and not much more (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, I just want to shoot stuff that move people).  Although I was thinking my photos, I don\u2019t think I shot anything meaningful. \n\nFast forward to 2017. Dslr was too big for me so I decided I needed something small. Bought a Fuji x100f and have been shooting with it since then non stop. This is important because after buying this camera, that\u2019s when I feel I actually started photography. I gave up on colour photography since it didn\u2019t feel right for me (apart from few photos here and there) and tried to shoot black and white. I bought books of the big names and tried to study their photos. I ended up loving the photos of Andre Kertesz the most and used him as an example about where I want to get. And in the meantime I went out to shoot and tried to take similar photos. \n\nAnd my god the results are bad. They are uninteresting. They have nothing in common to Kertesz\u2019s photos. Okay let me say this here - I obviously don\u2019t expect to be shooting masterpieces everytime I go out. I don\u2019t even expect to shoot masterpieces even once per year. But I do expect every now and then to like my photos. The reality is though, I don\u2019t like any of them. \n\nNow photography is not my job and *probably* won\u2019t be unless I change careers. And my job has nothing to do with the arts. However, I do photography because it allows me to express myself in the only way I want to. So quitting is not an option (but I feel it might have to be). However, when I look at my photos, they are painfully bad. Composition is bad. The theme is bad. Everything is just bad. And to add insult to injury, I go to Instagram and see photos of friends who don\u2019t really do photography but have taken some shots with their phones and they get better photos than mine. They aren\u2019t more than a handful of people, don\u2019t get me wrong. But how do they do it?!\n\nHonestly, reviewing my photos is a painful process. It\u2019s a process where I\u2019m reminded, photo by photo, that they all suck and as a result, I suck. Then you read about these big photographers and how they were shooting amazing photos even after they picked up a camera at the age of 20...\n\nSo my question to you is, what can I do in order to improve? Going out to shoot more feels counter productive to be honest, mainly because I feel like I lack *some* foundation. I don\u2019t know what that is. And because I lack that foundation, no matter how many photos I take, they\u2019re all going to be bad. Is there light at the end of the tunnel?

I don\u2019t know if I can improve. Let me explain what I mean. \n\nI bought my first dslr in 2014. I was shooting a lot back then but I never really liked the pictures. I had some good colour photos but I recognised they were good because of the pretty colours and not much more (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, I just want to shoot stuff that move people).  Although I was thinking my photos, I don\u2019t think I shot anything meaningful. \n\nFast forward to 2017. Dslr was too big for me so I decided I needed something small. Bought a Fuji x100f and have been shooting with it since then non stop. This is important because after buying this camera, that\u2019s when I feel I actually started photography. I gave up on colour photography since it didn\u2019t feel right for me (apart from few photos here and there) and tried to shoot black and white. I bought books of the big names and tried to study their photos. I ended up loving the photos of Andre Kertesz the most and used him as an example about where I want to get. And in the meantime I went out to shoot and tried to take similar photos. \n\nAnd my god the results are bad. They are uninteresting. They have nothing in common to Kertesz\u2019s photos. Okay let me say this here - I obviously don\u2019t expect to be shooting masterpieces everytime I go out. I don\u2019t even expect to shoot masterpieces even once per year.

We see video cameras and hybrids that are implementing dual native iso. There is incredible advancement in the field for making amazing sensors. \n\nBut, as the title asks, why aren\u2019t there more cameras that are implementing dual native iso, or maybe even a camera with triple native iso? Especially for smaller sensors, who\u2019s low light performance tends to suffer more than larger sensors, this seems like it would be a great opportunity to get the most out of a particular technology. Of course, anything that can be used to improve smaller sensors can be used to improve larger sensors, but the point is simply why don\u2019t more cameras do this, especially smaller sensor cameras that would probably greatly benefit from that loins of architecture. \n\nFor examine, I own a panasonic GX85. It\u2019s a great camera with about 12-13 stops of dynamic range, and it maintains 10 stops of dynamic range down to about 800 iso (according to DXOmark). even then, I can get relatively clean pictures down to about 1600, and 3200 iso is still the lowest usable iso for acceptable pictures before the image really starts to break down. Why not have another native iso at 1600, which would allow probably allow the camera to achieve rather impressive low light performance for its sensor size? A micro four thirds camera would be a great candidate for this use case in photography, but, the only micro four thirds camera I know of that uses dual native iso is the GH5 (and GH5s?), and I think it only uses dual iso in video mode.\n\nAdditionally, why do we have to stop there? Why not make sensors with 3 native ISOs? One can be at 100, or even 50, for daylight situations, a other native iso right where the sensor stops being able to capture at least 10 stops of dynamic range (using my panasonic, right around 800), then another native iso for low light situations, say around 3200, or even 6400. I understand this would be a more expensive sensor to implement, but, for example, smaller sensor cameras tend to cost less, so the savings there could be used to optimize the sensor further, making crop sensor cameras a more viable alternative to their larger cousins. \n\n___\n\nRelated to this: why couldn\u2019t we have a camera that captures images with 2 different ISOs at the same time? This idea might only be feasible on larger megapixel cameras, or larger sensor sizes. I also understand this idea would be more technologically complex than the idea above, but bear with my explanation. \n\nThe Sony A9 is capable of global sensor readout to enable silent electronic shutter shooting with no trolling shutter artifacts (i\u2019m sure there are other cameras, this is just the one that immediately comes to my mind). Understanding that an increase in ISO requires a reduction in shutter speed, and knowing that the sony A9 is capable of global shutter readout, why couldn\u2019t we have a sensor where half the pixels are at a low iso (such as 100), and the other half are at at an iso a few stops higher than this (say 400, or 800). When an image is recorded, the global electronic shutter closes on the higher iso pixels 2 or 3 stops earlier than the shutter closing in the sensor altogether.\n\nWhy would anyone do this? It could allow increased dynamic range in a single exposure. Let\u2019s take my GX85 again and say it only has 12 stops of dynamic range. If we made a GX85+, we could potentially increase the dynamic range of the sensor by the however many stops of separation those two ISOs are at (so, from 12 to 14 or 15), and this is without counting whatever other gains we could get in noise reduction due to technically combining 2 separate exposures into an image. \n\nIf we apply this to a FF camera with 14 or 15 stops of dynamic range and a high megapixel count (to offset the fact that half the pixels would be captured at one iso, and half at the other, potentially reducing spacial resolution), we could increase the dynamic range to potentially 16-18 stops *just from the two exposures alone*.\n\n___\n\nSorry for the long post, I just hope I was able to explain my questions well enough so anybody can participate. \n\nTL;DR\n\n1) why don\u2019t more cameras employ a dual, or even triple, native iso architecture? It seems like a great way to optimize or offset the limited performance of smaller sensors, especially.\n\n2) why couldn\u2019t we design a sensor a sensor with split ISO, half the pixels capturing an image at low iso, the other half capturing an image at a higher iso, so we can increase the dynamic range of a single exposure by essentially using the sensor to bracket an image in 1 clean exposure, instead of 3 separate exposures?", "title": "Why don\u2019t more cameras have dual native iso?

Of course, anything that can be used to improve smaller sensors can be used to improve larger sensors, but the point is simply why don\u2019t more cameras do this, especially smaller sensor cameras that would probably greatly benefit from that loins of architecture. \n\nFor examine, I own a panasonic GX85. It\u2019s a great camera with about 12-13 stops of dynamic range, and it maintains 10 stops of dynamic range down to about 800 iso (according to DXOmark). even then, I can get relatively clean pictures down to about 1600, and 3200 iso is still the lowest usable iso for acceptable pictures before the image really starts to break down. Why not have another native iso at 1600, which would allow probably allow the camera to achieve rather impressive low light performance for its sensor size? A micro four thirds camera would be a great candidate for this use case in photography, but, the only micro four thirds camera I know of that uses dual native iso is the GH5 (and GH5s?), and I think it only uses dual iso in video mode.\n\nAdditionally, why do we have to stop there? Why not make sensors with 3 native ISOs? One can be at 100, or even 50, for daylight situations, a other native iso right where the sensor stops being able to capture at least 10 stops of dynamic range (using my panasonic, right around 800), then another native iso for low light situations, say around 3200, or even 6400. I understand this would be a more expensive sensor to implement, but, for example, smaller sensor cameras tend to cost less, so the savings there could be used to optimize the sensor further, making crop sensor cameras a more viable alternative to their larger cousins. \n\n___\n\nRelated to this: why couldn\u2019t we have a camera that captures images with 2 different ISOs at the same time? This idea might only be feasible on larger megapixel cameras, or larger sensor sizes. I also understand this idea would be more technologically complex than the idea above, but bear with my explanation. \n\nThe Sony A9 is capable of global sensor readout to enable silent electronic shutter shooting with no trolling shutter artifacts (i\u2019m sure there are other cameras, this is just the one that immediately comes to my mind). Understanding that an increase in ISO requires a reduction in shutter speed, and knowing that the sony A9 is capable of global shutter readout, why couldn\u2019t we have a sensor where half the pixels are at a low iso (such as 100), and the other half are at at an iso a few stops higher than this (say 400, or 800). When an image is recorded, the global electronic shutter closes on the higher iso pixels 2 or 3 stops earlier than the shutter closing in the sensor altogether.\n\nWhy would anyone do this? It could allow increased dynamic range in a single exposure. Let\u2019s take my GX85 again and say it only has 12 stops of dynamic range. If we made a GX85+, we could potentially increase the dynamic range of the sensor by the however many stops of separation those two ISOs are at (so, from 12 to 14 or 15), and this is without counting whatever other gains we could get in noise reduction due to technically combining 2 separate exposures into an image. \n\nIf we apply this to a FF camera with 14 or 15 stops of dynamic range and a high megapixel count (to offset the fact that half the pixels would be captured at one iso, and half at the other, potentially reducing spacial resolution), we could increase the dynamic range to potentially 16-18 stops *just from the two exposures alone*.\n\n___\n\nSorry for the long post, I just hope I was able to explain my questions well enough so anybody can participate. \n\nTL;DR\n\n1) why don\u2019t more cameras employ a dual, or even triple, native iso architecture? It seems like a great way to optimize or offset the limited performance of smaller sensors, especially.\n\n2) why couldn\u2019t -----> -----> we !!!  design !!!  a sensor a sensor with split ISO, half the pixels capturing an image at low iso, the other half capturing an image at a higher iso, so -----> we !!!  can increase the dynamic range of a single exposure by essentially using the sensor to bracket an image in 1 clean exposure, instead of 3 separate exposures?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9gu4i1/why_dont_more_cameras_have_dual_native_iso_also/"}, {"autor": "scottklarr", "selftext": "I decided to make a light box to save money...

The photos are not bad, but there's just something that feels off to me about them, especially when these photographers are presenting them to such a large audience for gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere do we draw the line with this? When traveling to impoverished places, is anything between an uncreative snapshot and an editorial/journalistic story inappropriate?
