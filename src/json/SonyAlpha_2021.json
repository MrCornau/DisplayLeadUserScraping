Not sure if this is a technique you guys are familiar with / have tried before, so here's a quick summary: when you're shooting macro photos with a macro lens, your \"depth of field\" is very shallow - it's hard to get an entire object in focus, unless it's perfectly flat and 90 degrees to the lens. For 3D objects, that isn't usually going to be the case. \n\nSo, to get a really sharp macro photo where the whole subject is in good focus, you need to shoot a bunch of photos in sequence, either adjusting your focus slightly each time, or leaving your focus as-is and move the camera forward (or backwards) for each pic. I tried doing the first technique (adjusting focus slightly over and over) but my results were always kinda crappy, probably due to my inexperience + the fact that I'm using a very old / cheap macro lens. I found I was over-adjusting each time and the output looked weird, with stripes that were in focus and stripes that weren't. Not great. \n\nI did more research and learned that I could improve my results by using a 'macro focusing rail' - basically, a piece of hardware you mount your camera to, which allows you to move the whole camera (and thus your focal point) forwards/backwards by microscopic increments. After my sweetie and I took our son on a Cub Scout hike in the Marin Headlands yesterday, we met up with a dude I found on Craigslist over in Sausalito, and he sold me his barely-used macro rail, and I've just done my first test shoot with it. \n\n[This pic shows my setup](https://i.imgur.com/JiIw8DD.jpg): Basically, the macro rail sits on the tripod, and the camera sits on a small carriage mounted to the rail and attached to a long threaded screw in the center. By turning that little crank at the back, the screw turns, which scoots the carriage forward/backward by tiny amounts.\n\nMy first test subject is my grandfather Frank's old pocket watch, which (if I remember correctly) he was given by his father when he and his twin brother Albert graduated high school. I got the macro lens [focused on the front edge of the pocket watch](https://i.imgur.com/AX06kuh.jpg), snapped a photo, turned the crank once (moving the camera forward a tiny bit), snapped a photo, turned the crank once, snapped a photo, etc. etc., all the way to the [very back of the watch.](https://i.imgur.com/Yr1YXI3.jpg) I used my remote trigger to avoid jostling the camera too much between shots. When all was said-and-done, I ended up with 38 photos, each with a slightly different portion of the pocket watch in focus. Just for fun, I also [combined all 38 photos into a GIF](https://imgur.com/bGNjuow), so you can see the focal point moving from one end to the other.\n\nSo, getting to the point: after combining all 38 photos using a *completely insane* shareware program called Helicon Focus, [I got a final output, combining the in-focus portions of each of the 38 photos](https://i.imgur.com/opfm5vU.jpg).
