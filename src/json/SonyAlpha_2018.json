I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  \ud83d\ude02\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been using my trusty ol' Canon Rebel T3i now for years.  For most of that time, I was never super into photography honestly; I used it mostly just to take pictures of the wife and dogs and travel shots.  Nothing too serious and never much editing.  The only lenses I've got are the EFS 18-55/3.5-56 IS, the EFS 18-200/3.5-5.6 IFS, and the 50mm 1.8.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell recently I've developed a photography itch that needs scratching, thanks in large part to a couple of friends of mine who are serious hobbyists.  I want to get more serious, and after a ton of research and reading articles and watching videos and talking with my photographer friends I think it's time to take the plunge into the world of full-frame mirrorless.  I'm looking for some input from people who know better than I do about this stuff and maybe who have found themselves in a similar situation in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kind of shooting I plan on doing is mostly photography; videography and YouTube content creation or whatever just isn't what I'm going for.  I want to do street photography, travel photography to include landscape stuff, and portrait photography.  I'm a helicopter pilot in the Marine Corps, and it would be nice to get some great shots of the aircraft in action as well as the Marines hard at work maintaining them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I'm thinking, and tell me if you disagree and why I should do something different:  I can get an A7 for probably $700 or less, and the A7ii is going for probably around $300 more.  I think the A7iii might just be too much camera for me; I can always sell and upgrade later if this turns out to be something that I'm really good at and want to continue to pursue.  The main practical differences between the A7 and the A7ii, as I understand it, are the IBIS, faster AF, and better video shooting capability.  To me, it doesn't seem worth the extra cost, especially when I could take the difference in price and splurge on a better lens instead.  I am a bit concerned, however that maybe low-light performance will suffer a bit, as a faster shutter speed may be required if not using IBIS.  But if I get a lens with OSS, that should make up for it, right?  What's the rule of thumb concerning stabilization?  You gain about 2-4 stops?  Does this stack when you combine IBIS with OSS?  How is the performance of an A7 with an OSS lens vs an A7ii without an OSS lens?  \n\n\nAs for lenses, my buddy who shoots on the A7iii says I should forego the kit lens and pony up the cash for the 24-105/4, which according to him and others is probably the most versatile lens that can handle 90% of what you need to do and takes fantastic, sharp images.  But that is a $1300 lens!  \ud83d\ude15 Frankly I was thinking that the kit lens plus one or two specialized and faster primes (85mm for portraits, 24mm or less for landscape) would be sufficient.  I suppose there's also the option of using an adapter for the couple of Canon lenses that I already have.  But since two of them are EFS, and thus created for use only with cropped sensors, I would need to shoot in cropped mode in order to use them, correct?  Still, it might be worth it to have the extra reach of the 18-200mm.

I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  \ud83d\ude02\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been using my trusty ol' Canon Rebel T3i now for years.  For most of that time, I was never super into photography honestly; I used it mostly just to take pictures of the wife and dogs and travel shots.  Nothing too serious and never much editing.  The only lenses I've got are the EFS 18-55/3.5-56 IS, the EFS 18-200/3.5-5.6 IFS, and the 50mm 1.8.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell recently -----> -----> I !!! 've developed !!!  a photography itch that needs scratching, thanks in large part to a couple of friends of mine who are serious hobbyists.  I want to get more serious, and after a ton of research and reading articles and watching videos and talking with my photographer friends I think it's time to take the plunge into the world of full-frame mirrorless.  I'm looking for some input from people who know better than I do about this stuff and maybe who have found themselves in a similar situation in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kind of shooting I plan on doing is mostly photography; videography and YouTube content creation or whatever just isn't what I'm going for.  I want to do street photography, travel photography to include landscape stuff, and portrait photography.  I'm a helicopter pilot in the Marine Corps, and it would be nice to get some great shots of the aircraft in action as well as the Marines hard at work maintaining them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I'm thinking, and tell me if you disagree and why I should do something different:  I can get an A7 for probably $700 or less, and the A7ii is going for probably around $300 more.  I think the A7iii might just be too much camera for me; I can always sell and upgrade later if this turns out to be something that I'm really good at and want to continue to pursue.  The main practical differences between the A7 and the A7ii, as I understand it, are the IBIS, faster AF, and better video shooting capability.  To me, it doesn't seem worth the extra cost, especially when I could take the difference in price and splurge on a better lens instead.  I am a bit concerned, however that maybe low-light performance will suffer a bit, as a faster shutter speed may be required if not using IBIS.  But if I get a lens with OSS, that should make up for it, right?  What's the rule of thumb concerning stabilization?  You gain about 2-4 stops?  Does this stack when you combine IBIS with OSS?  How is the performance of an A7 with an OSS lens vs an A7ii without an OSS lens?  \n\n\nAs for lenses, my buddy who shoots on the A7iii says I should forego the kit lens and pony up the cash for the 24-105/4, which according to him and others is probably the most versatile lens that can handle 90% of what you need to do and takes fantastic, sharp images.  But that is a $1300 lens!  \ud83d\ude15 Frankly I was thinking that the kit lens plus one or two specialized and faster primes (85mm for portraits, 24mm or less for landscape) would be sufficient.  I suppose there's also the option of using an adapter for the couple of Canon lenses that I already have.  But since two of them are EFS, and thus created for use only with cropped sensors, I would need to shoot in cropped mode in order to use them, correct?  Still, it might be worth it to have the extra reach of the 18-200mm.
