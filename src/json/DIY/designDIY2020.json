My husband and I are currently in the process of converting our basement into a master suite, and my favorite but also trickiest project is finally finished as of yesterday \u2014 the master closet/dressing room! This was a very weird space with a sump pump in one corner, various different height bulkheads, a pipe on one wall from floor to ceiling, and a big ugly metal door leading to the backyard. There was a good amount of prep work before designing/installing the closet, including new floors/lights/paint (professionally done), rerouting a duct on one wall, and replacing the sump pump. Even after all that, I thought for a while that we would have to hire professional closet designers because of the strange features of the space, but after five different quotes, I realized it wasn\u2019t going to be possible to get everything I wanted and stay in budget (\\~$10K; my husband and I both make good money, and we have no kids). We got designs that were super nice within budget, just not with everything I wanted (a good amount of hanging space behind doors, an island, a vanity, built-in hampers, etc). So I went looking for DIY options.\n\nI ended up using [closets.com](http://closets.com/)\u2019s DIY online custom closet design tool and designing the whole thing myself. The tool allows you to customize the height and width of every unit individually down to an eighth of an inch and plan everything out with a great deal of specificity, so it worked even for the weird space/level of customization we needed. All told, the closet units came out to $9,800. Most of that cost came from the doors/drawers and upgrading to shaker cabinets over a flat front. The weird corner cabinet to hide the sump pump wasn\u2019t cheap either. It took about 6 weeks for everything to arrive from the day I ordered/paid, and it came on huge pallets altogether weighing a total of more than 2,000 pounds.\n\nMy husband and stepfather did the full installation. They are both super handy, and my stepfather has experience in carpentry (as a hobby), but it was still a relatively tricky/difficult process. There were just SO many different components, and the instructions were (naturally) very generalized and not specific to our custom closet. Closets.com does a dual support system where there\u2019s both a rail support at the top and it\u2019s also floor supported. It took a good five full working days in total to complete the installation. No specialized tools were required (except we used a jigsaw to cut a hole in the bottom of the corner cabinet for the sump pump), just drills and screwdrivers for the most part. Apart from the rail supports, it was pretty similar to putting together furniture (if the instructions were really vague and there were a million parts).\n\nI am so, so grateful to my husband and my stepfather for working on this for me. They are incredible. I did the styling. For those who may wonder, my husband\u2019s clothes are in the hanging space behind the doors and in some drawers. The total dimensions of the room are 14 feet by 12 feet.

I've done a decent amount of research for my design, but I'd like to get some external comments for any issues it might have before I start ordering lumber and building. /!/ The images from the 3D rendering I've made using Onshape can be found in [this album](https://imgur.com/a/eJDGcKe) with some comments on the images regarding the overall design.  \n  \n\n[This is a view of the current area](https://i.imgur.com/mN9979O.jpg). The existing double doors into the basement and the door into the garage sit about 20\" above ground level and never had any steps leading up when we purchased the house. There is a dryer vent and outer faucet that currently sit about 3-4 inches above where the proposed surface of the deck would be, so those will likely have to be relocated.  \n  \nThe overall dimensions are roughly 20'x12', 18\" from ground level to the surface of the deck. The prepared ground right now is a stripped away patch where a cheap stamped concrete patio used to sit; after hauling away the concrete pavers theres a couple inches of crushed stone/dirt at the suface. I plan to add another 2 inches of crushed stone beneath to mitigate insects, digging animals, and vegetation growth. \n  \nThe idea is to use pressure treated lumber throughout, with composite decking for the decking, stair surfaces, and step facia.   \n  \nThe frame ends on either side of the sill plate will be mounted with inverted double 2x10 joist hangars due to the proximity to the stairs/adjoining wall of the foundation. All joists will be anchored with galvanized joist hangers and joist screws. I plan to use joist tape on top of the whole frame to help mitigate moisture buildup, especially between the sandwiched 2x10s on the frame. 3\" deck screws used throughout, with composite decking screws for the decking.   \n  \nFootings will be 6x6 pressure treated posts supported by 18\" columns sunk 40\" deep per local code to sit below the frost line (NE USA).  \n  \nRough estimates put materials at $850 for lumber, $1500 for the composite decking, and other $1000 for misc items like joist hangers, hardware, some tools, concrete, etc.  \n  \nThis is my first time tackling a big project like this and I would greatly appreciate anyone's input as a dummy-check to make sure I'm not overlooking any glaring issues with the design before I pull the trigger and get started.
