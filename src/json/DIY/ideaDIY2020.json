It's very stiff right now, but I think will soften up with wear.  I had fun doing this, and it really only requires basic sewing skills, creativity and problem solving.  The leather I got from my dad's basement, so total cost was about $40 for cotton duck, 1\" webbing and buckles for straps, and another $30 for the paraffin and bees wax.  I have since purchased some cheap cotton canvas tarps on Amazon that I will wax for another apron and other projects.  I made some mistakes but once I live with this one for a while I can always make another or alter this one.  I love having lots of pockets.\n\n[finished - very stiff](https://preview.redd.it/d2wg251mxn661.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d6aaf560a1381029c1aef8a3abe235c85535976)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[making the wax](https://preview.redd.it/0qbla27qxn661.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5639eb386c8758d11a19b6bba1b157dc4008f04)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[santa's workshop](https://preview.redd.it/9sw98r2uxn661.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f91f5577fc22249520c3f305fa89d7fcd50b739)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[the tiny woodworkers guild apron sitting on top of some waxed, but not ironed, canvas ](https://preview.redd.it/zoney5eezn661.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c525e7483b0902baded278b1e9974efe561ed5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[laying out the pieces -- I made the top pockets too tall for short pencils, so that will be a revision](https://preview.redd.it/v0nn61dwxn661.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a387043fb4e3a929372cd8a31c2b28f6c790205e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[sewing the subassemblies together - this is a carpenter's square and shop scissor pocket](https://preview.redd.it/rmjfxti1yn661.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11793c04328d9835f48a96695a4b6461338f4d47)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[roll of leather I stole from my dad \\(he actually mailed it to me\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vverk99byn661.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f402ae4ca35a0f3e973749681d668be4c05e744d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Further along on the mid-pocket subassembly](https://preview.redd.it/g6h5qh8hyn661.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf4b6831fed678d106624a36f259b759a2fab9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img wkjbmmsmyn661...*", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 2, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/khxuxi/made_a_shop_apron_waxed_canvas_and_leather/", "identifyer": 304735, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 305356, "autor": "insert-username12", "date": 1606675503000, "content": "Hi!

If there's a place to get cheap parts for making a floor lamp, I could potentially repurposed that, though I doubt such a thing would be clear/translucent.  \n2) The stand. just like a typical plain bottom of a floor lamp.
