We purchased our house with a 30 year mortgage and payed on it for 14 years, refinanced once for lower percentage rate and same amount of years left to payoff. Now with interest rates dropping as low as they are, we refinanced again for a 15 year mortgage (16 left on old mortgage) and took out13K to redo the kitchen with lower monthly payments (setup with bi-weekly payments to pay off even faster). We did 100% of the demo, wiring, plumbing, and cabinet installation ourselves, so that the money could go to materials. This process was a nightmare for many reasons, but in the end we absolutely love the result. We started this project in mid-April and finished in mid-October, so six months from ordering materials to completion. There were Covid delays every step of the way, but we were only out of a fully functioning kitchen for 2.5 months (2 months longer than planned). The 13K budget was for cabinets and countertops, the new appliances were on top of that. I learned a LOT in the process and have a few new tools for the next project (this is my first kitchen remodel). Hopefully other DIY Home improver\u2019s (AKA too frugal to pay someone else top dollar to do it for you ... at least that is my case) find this inspiring and a way to accomplish their house dream renovations for \"free-ish\" (mortgage interest savings).\n\nHere is the kitchen that we started with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the kitchen that we started with. Old cabinets stopping 12\\\\\" shy of the ceiling. Notice the inset drawer faces at the angled sections!](https://preview.redd.it/vb52hf19hrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f17f60e08da9e54481fc016536e8afb4464c2ee)\n\nOnce the mortgage was going through, the first step was to measure the existing cabinet layout, making layout changes, and start looking at on-line cabinet options. There are many options out there, but finding one suite of cabinets that fit your needs is a difficult proposition where you can find 90% of what you need, but that one or two cabinets of odd dimensions is not available. At that point, you have to start again with a different cabinet builder. Ultimately, we went with semi-custom Manganite (color) cabinets from Home Depot\u2019s on-line store. The price was right and we were able to get what we wanted in the 13 matching cabinets that we needed to order. The cabinets came with soft close doors and drawers. To aid in this part of the process, I suggest taking measurements and drawing out a schematic of your \u201cvision\u201d for final cabinet design. Our changed layout included extension of top cabinets all the way to the ceiling, extending the cabinet above the refrigerator to be 24\u201d deep instead of previous 12\u201ddepth, redesigning the stove hood type from a 90 degree into the wall to straight up through the roof, and extending the peninsula depth to include 12\u201d deep base cabinets on the back side of the peninsula.\n\nHere is that rough sketch: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here is the rough sketch of the new kitchen layout.](https://preview.redd.it/yink8v1qhrh61.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94482d1a0be0c5c29061a0f18838d195193f45a3)\n\nFrom this layout sketch and size of cabinets available, we were able to identify where spacers were needed. For instance, the 13.5\u201d space currently to the right of the stove was to be filled with a 12\u201d cabinet, so a 1.5\u201d finished same color spacer would be needed to attach to the edge of that cabinet to fill the extra space (top and bottom cabinets). We ordered 3\u201d spacers that could be cut to fit throughout this project, as needed. I originally purchased a jig saw to accomplish cutting these with a jig, but quickly decided (first cut) that I needed a real table saw to make these cuts precise and uniformly straight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the table saw and jig saw used for this project. The table saw was used for the straight spacer cuts and the jig saw for electric box, vent, and plumbing cuts.](https://preview.redd.it/095d1dd2irh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acd3c3fab593ef705696a66e2cd16ce1f037d705)\n\nOnce the layout was finalized and cabinets ordered, it was a hurry up and wait scenario. Covid-19 associated delays in manufacturing of the cabinets and associated hardware delayed the original delivery date for the cabinets by 1.5 months. Original delivery commitment was mid-June, but we ended up getting the cabinets at the end of July. Covid or not, delays may happen at any time, so I strongly suggest refraining from demo until the cabinets are in and inspected for a complete order and satisfaction. Otherwise, you may be waiting another 2 months for a replacement that is required to move forward with the project and a prematurely dismantled kitchen. At the same time, give yourself time for unexpected surprises behind your existing cabinets and feel free to demo what you can live without.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the wall with the previous vent and holes where tile was expected in the new kitchen. Electric was also in the wrong place for the new kitchen plan.](https://preview.redd.it/u7nrm8boirh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c443a4f87c798852a71e6963fba533e7f7167d)\n\nThis was the wall behind the stove cabinets with holes in the drywall where I expected to have tile in the new kitchen, so I ended up with more work than expected and happy that I did this while waiting for cabinets. Also note the location of the vent out tube and the electric box. Both of those had to be moved. The vent was redirected straight up through the roof and the electric box was moved to be hidden behind the stainless steel vent column. This included placing some 2x4 studs within the wall to accommodate the mounting of the new electric box location and hood mount (no photo, but just cutting a 2/4 to size and screwing to existing studs where you want them, simple and minor). With those changes made, it was simple cutting a new drywall piece and screwing back into place (to cut drywall in a straight line, scour the drywall cut line with a razor blade, then bend at scour and you have a straight cut piece).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here you can see the new drywall with the moved electric box.  Also moved the drywall seam to below the counter tops for ease of hiding that joint. The rest will be tiled or covered by cabinets.](https://preview.redd.it/b2zufxkojrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed3b96e685c824a97f3b1ca81b4370d26c866316)\n\nNow that cabinets are delivered/approved and I have the area behind the stove reconfigured ahead of time, I have the real work ahead \u2026 Demo and installation. Knowing that once demolition hit we would not have a kitchen, I scheduled counter top measurements for the following Monday to give me 9 days to finish cabinet installation. Cabinet removal was pretty easy with just a few screws holding them to the wall and a couple screws holding them to the adjacent cabinet. Remove screws and remove cabinets. Some screws were stripped where I needed to use vise-grips to grab the heads and slowly remove them. The countertops came up easily with a few upward pulls. This part was pretty simple and straight forward. If you remove all the screws and the cabinet does not move, look again because you missed a screw somewhere. I worked my way from right to left around the kitchen to minimize time without a sink/dishwasher (above/below pictures).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Installation of cabinets. Notice the temporary level guide board on the back wall for the upper cabinets.  ](https://preview.redd.it/4y3dnrtbkrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0f2710702d104ef78a857a0eeabdc9472e24e8)\n\nInstallation of the upper cabinets was pretty quick and easy. The process entails measuring down from the ceiling to where the base of the cabinets are going to sit, attach a horizontal board at that level line, perch the cabinet on the board and screw them into the wall studs through the back of the cabinets. Also place screws into the adjacent cabinet sides, as applicable. In the above picture, you can see the use of a board to place the stove cabinets in place and level. You will also notice that the old sink cabinet is still in place. That is because the plumbing needed to be disconnected to remove that cabinet, but I could not turn off the main water to the house due to a previously unknown been hive at the shut-off (they would start attacking when within 10 ft \u2026 Africanized bees and mean). With a looming deadline and a budget, here is my multi-layer \u201cbee suit\u201d and flying insect killer used to attack that hive. I also went out at the coldest part of the night (summer in AZ so not that cool, but late). \n\n[Middle of AZ summer with layers and every bit of flesh covered \\(missed the nose\\) to battle the bee hive ...

Flying Insect spray applied for two nights before I was able to approach successfully. ](https://preview.redd.it/zadpmobrlrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=133f5f3ced972e0287bfe58f55168db9d739b58a)\n\nOnce the hive was taken care of, I could turn off the water and take a torch to the copper pipes, remove the copper plumbing apparatus, and sweat on copper caps to those copper inlet pipes. I am sure there are many sources and videos detailing sweating copper, so watch those and don\u2019t listen to me. In general, it just takes a torch, silver solder, flux, and a slice of bread. Turn off the main water, heat the soldered joint until you can pull the connection apart. Water will run out of the pipe, so have a bucket ready. Stuff a little bread into the inlet pipe, add flux to the outside rim, connect copper end cap, heat until the silver solder melts into the joint, turn on water, and check for leaks. At this point the old sink cabinet can slide right out (after removing the screws from back wall and sides of adjacent cabinets). Important: keep the drain trap attached and full of water to keep sewage smell from emanating throughout the house. Disconnect shortly as needed, but replace and fill.\n\nI have covered the ease of installing the upper cabinets, now for the lower base cabinets. Installation of the base cabinets were a challenge. I had granite countertops ordered for installation, so being level was paramount (front/back/left/right and across the entire kitchen). I used a combination of a 4 ft level (across cabinets) and a couple 1 ft levels (front/back on each cabinet) and started working from right to left around the kitchen with wedges under the cabinets where needed to get them exactly level. Unfortunately, as I worked my way around, I would find a new high point and would have to work backwards to fix what I had already done. Then I would move forward again to find a new high point, causing me to work backwards again. After three redoes of the lower cabinets from stove to peninsula, I finally borrowed a laser level to find the high point in the room and work backwards from there which happened to be the area that I planned to set in place last.(back corner of the expanded peninsula). We are talking about minutia of fine tweaking, so no photos will help to explain. In the end, I ordered the \u201cEZ Leveler\u201d kits for each of my lower cabinets and the fine tuning was simple moving forward. These kits involve drilling holes in the face plates of the lower cabinets and screwing in the levelers to the front and back of each cabinet. Once installed, you can adjust the front and back heights with a simple turn to make fine adjustments (see picture). These are then covered up by the base plates. \n\n[These are the ex level adjustments. The top knobs raise and lower the back and the lower ones raise and lower the front.  Micro adjustments were super easy using these.](https://preview.redd.it/s0dqj99umrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d31499a4acc2218bf955b98c5a87f99c493556f0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Once cabinets are in place, the kick board cover the holes and levelers.](https://preview.redd.it/9h9wek31orh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027769b71ec9dd0d7af4d994d10a811ff0209d0e)\n\nOther than leveling, the other major issue I was running into is where my kitchen layout had non-90 degree angles (cabinet options are available to handle 90 degree turns as a single unit). The old cabinet doors and drawers had faces smaller than the actual cabinets and the new ones were as wide as the cabinets. This created clearance issues with opening and closing drawers at the angle points. Those same clearances were exacerbated by addition of handles. I used all of the spacer boards in my original design to shift everything way from those angle points to provide at least minimal clearances without cutting drawer fronts. In the end, I still had to cut one handle to make things work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here you can see the tight clearances that I had with the drawer faces and the one handle that was cut short on the left side.](https://preview.redd.it/mc24d6ejorh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d71bf651dfb3a43d503e6d968f613154b2cd015)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Even with the handle cut, I barely had the clearance I needed.](https://preview.redd.it/g606ma7torh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c5562e0f33564c128dd5814473a2a023ff01383)\n\nAt this point, I successfully reached my 9-day window to have cabinets in place and ready for the counter tops to be measured. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here are the cabinets installed, level, and ready for the Granite measurements and installation. \\(My final product\\)](https://preview.redd.it/5zjw1o94prh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee49e1731e47ddc9889ebffe1daf99eae0cd2300)\n\nFrom here, the counter tops were measured promptly, but cutting and installation was stalled for 2.5 months. We lived with it on disposable plates/cutlery/cups \u2026 and washing other dishes from the front yard hose (back yard was tied to the kitchen water input so was capped and non-functional). If delays are expected, I suggest installing a temporary sink, temporary plumbing and not taking the long wait. I just believed the short delay, by short delay, by short delay excuses long enough that it no longer mattered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here would be your temporary sink option that could have been plumbed and used during the unexpected 2.5 month wait.](https://preview.redd.it/biopikncprh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d24fd4e0cd53f7ac345d5c93f2284c2c33cfa8bf)\n\nThe final bit of this piece is the final product with counter tops and the stove back splash. Granite counter tops come with installation, so not DIY. The back tile at the stove gave me an opportunity to give my neighbor who owns a tile install company a small job, so also not DIY. I take credit and criticism for everything else. I know that I need to replace that pantry door \u2026 and change the door knob. My plan is to custom make the pantry door, which will be another project.  I have tried to explain this process thoroughly, but I am happy to answer any questions that people may have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here is the final result of the kitchen remodel.  In total, about 7K for the cabinets and 4.5k for the granite.

"MarkedSent": "taking advantage of low interest rates to remodel kitchen for basically free (interest savings). /!/ the wife and i have wanted to redo our kitchen for years. we purchased our house with a 30 year mortgage and payed on it for 14 years, refinanced once for lower percentage rate and same amount of years left to payoff. now with interest rates dropping as low as they are, we refinanced again for a 15 year mortgage (16 left on old mortgage) and took out13k to redo the kitchen with lower monthly payments (setup with bi-weekly payments to pay off even faster). we did 100% of the demo, wiring, plumbing, and cabinet installation ourselves, so that the money could go to materials. this process was a nightmare for many reasons, but in the end we absolutely love the result. we started this project in mid-april and finished in mid-october, so six months from ordering materials to completion. there were covid delays every step of the way, but we were only out of a fully functioning kitchen for 2.5 months (2 months longer than planned). the 13k budget was for cabinets and countertops, the new appliances were on top of that. i learned a lot in the process and have a few new tools for the next project (this is my first kitchen remodel). hopefully other -----> diy !!!  home improver\u2019s (aka too frugal to pay someone else top dollar to do it for you ... at least that is my case) find this inspiring and a way to accomplish their house dream renovations for \"free-ish\" (mortgage interest savings).\n\nhere is the kitchen that we started with.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[this is the kitchen that we started with. old cabinets stopping 12\\\\\" shy of the ceiling. notice the inset drawer faces at the angled sections!](https://preview.redd.it/vb52hf19hrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f17f60e08da9e54481fc016536e8afb4464c2ee)\n\nonce the mortgage was going through, the first step was to measure the existing cabinet layout, making layout changes, and start looking at on-line cabinet options. there are many options out there, but finding one suite of cabinets that fit your needs is a difficult proposition where you can find 90% of what you need, but that one or two cabinets of odd dimensions is not available. at that point, you have to start again with a different cabinet builder. ultimately, we went with semi-custom manganite (color) cabinets from home depot\u2019s on-line store. the price was right and we were able to get what we wanted in the 13 matching cabinets that we needed to order. the cabinets came with soft close doors and drawers. to aid in this part of the process, i suggest taking measurements and drawing out a schematic of your \u201cvision\u201d for final cabinet design. our changed layout included extension of top cabinets all the way to the ceiling, extending the cabinet above the refrigerator to be 24\u201d deep instead of previous 12\u201ddepth, redesigning the stove hood type from a 90 degree into the wall to straight up through the roof, and extending the peninsula depth to include 12\u201d deep base cabinets on the back side of the peninsula.\n\nhere is that rough sketch: \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[here is the rough sketch of the new kitchen layout.](https://preview.redd.it/yink8v1qhrh61.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94482d1a0be0c5c29061a0f18838d195193f45a3)\n\nfrom this layout sketch and size of cabinets available, we were able to identify where spacers were needed. for instance, the 13.5\u201d space currently to the right of the stove was to be filled with a 12\u201d cabinet, so a 1.5\u201d finished same color spacer would be needed to attach to the edge of that cabinet to fill the extra space (top and bottom cabinets). we ordered 3\u201d spacers that could be cut to fit throughout this project, as needed. i originally purchased a jig saw to accomplish cutting these with a jig, but quickly decided (first cut) that i needed a real table saw to make these cuts precise and uniformly straight.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[this is the table saw and jig saw used for this project. the table saw was used for the straight spacer cuts and the jig saw for electric box, vent, and plumbing cuts.](https://preview.redd.it/095d1dd2irh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acd3c3fab593ef705696a66e2cd16ce1f037d705)\n\nonce the layout was finalized and cabinets ordered, it was a hurry up and wait scenario. covid-19 associated delays in manufacturing of the cabinets and associated hardware delayed the original delivery date for the cabinets by 1.5 months. original delivery commitment was mid-june, but we ended up getting the cabinets at the end of july. covid or not, delays may happen at any time, so i strongly suggest refraining from demo until the cabinets are in and inspected for a complete order and satisfaction. otherwise, you may be waiting another 2 months for a replacement that is required to move forward with the project and a prematurely dismantled kitchen. at the same time, give yourself time for unexpected surprises behind your existing cabinets and feel free to demo what you can live without.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[this is the wall with the previous vent and holes where tile was expected in the new kitchen. electric was also in the wrong place for the new kitchen plan.](https://preview.redd.it/u7nrm8boirh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c443a4f87c798852a71e6963fba533e7f7167d)\n\nthis was the wall behind the stove cabinets with holes in the drywall where i expected to have tile in the new kitchen, so i ended up with more work than expected and happy that i did this while waiting for cabinets. also note the location of the vent out tube and the electric box. both of those had to be moved. the vent was redirected straight up through the roof and the electric box was moved to be hidden behind the stainless steel vent column. this included placing some 2x4 studs within the wall to accommodate the mounting of the new electric box location and hood mount (no photo, but just cutting a 2/4 to size and screwing to existing studs where you want them, simple and minor). with those changes made, it was simple cutting a new drywall piece and screwing back into place (to cut drywall in a straight line, scour the drywall cut line with a razor blade, then bend at scour and you have a straight cut piece).  \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[here you can see the new drywall with the moved electric box.  also moved the drywall seam to below the counter tops for ease of hiding that joint. the rest will be tiled or covered by cabinets.](https://preview.redd.it/b2zufxkojrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed3b96e685c824a97f3b1ca81b4370d26c866316)\n\nnow that cabinets are delivered/approved and i have the area behind the stove reconfigured ahead of time, i have the real work ahead \u2026 demo and installation. knowing that once demolition hit we would not have a kitchen, i scheduled counter top measurements for the following monday to give me 9 days to finish cabinet installation. cabinet removal was pretty easy with just a few screws holding them to the wall and a couple screws holding them to the adjacent cabinet. remove screws and remove cabinets. some screws were stripped where i needed to use vise-grips to grab the heads and slowly remove them. the countertops came up easily with a few upward pulls. this part was pretty simple and straight forward. if you remove all the screws and the cabinet does not move, look again because you missed a screw somewhere. i worked my way from right to left around the kitchen to minimize time without a sink/dishwasher (above/below pictures).\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[installation of cabinets. notice the temporary level guide board on the back wall for the upper cabinets.  ](https://preview.redd.it/4y3dnrtbkrh61.jpg?width=4928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0f2710702d104ef78a857a0eeabdc9472e24e8)\n\ninstallation of the upper cabinets was pretty quick and easy. the process entails measuring down from the ceiling to where the base of the cabinets are going to sit, attach a horizontal board at that level line, perch the cabinet on the board and screw them into the wall studs through the back of the cabinets. also place screws into the adjacent cabinet sides, as applicable. in the above picture, you can see the use of a board to place the stove cabinets in place and level. you will also notice that the old sink cabinet is still in place. that is because the plumbing needed to be disconnected to remove that cabinet, but i could not turn off the main water to the house due to a previously unknown been hive at the shut-off (they would start attacking when within 10 ft \u2026 africanized bees and mean). with a looming deadline and a budget, here is my multi-layer \u201cbee suit\u201d and flying insect killer used to attack that hive. i also went out at the coldest part of the night (summer in az so not that cool,

Moreover, lifting  large furniture items and heavy boxes is strenuous to your back and  joints. You may even risk damage to your furniture when attempting to  move it yourself.\n\nBut DIYing is the best way to save extra money on moving your stuff  during a house renovation or when moving into a new house/apartment. So,  when you are moving heavy items within or out of your  home/office/apartment/garage, you don\u2019t want it to be labor-intensive  than it needs to be.\n\n**Always measure first**\n\nBefore beginning the lifting process, measure the hallways and doorways you have to pass through while moving the furniture. Trying to push an item through a hallway or doorway that\u2019s too small may result in damage to the item. It may even lead you to drop that item, causing potential injury to yourself or a moving partner.\n\n**Clear the pathway**\n\nMake sure that the pathway is clear before moving the items. This will allow you to see the path clearly and also prevent any tripping hazards.\n\nAlso, lay down a liner on the floor to prevent it from scuffing or damaging. You may use a roll-out plastic liner or moving blankets. And, always wear closed-toed non-slip shoes to avoid accidents.\n\n**Remove loose items or items inside furniture**\n\nAlways remove all loose items that may fall during lifting, like pillows, wall frames, etc. Keep these things in a safe place to easily set them again when the furniture is moved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t forget to empty dresser drawers and remove books from the shelves to reduce the weight. Removing items from furniture makes it lighter to some extent.\n\n**Disassemble large items**\n\nIf you have a furniture piece that can be disassembled into smaller pieces, disassemble it first and then begin moving it. Put the screws, bolts, and nuts safely in a plastic bag so that you can easily re-assemble the furniture.\n\n**Turn and move chairs in an \u2018L\u2019 shape**\n\nAn average looking chair (despite its name) might not be so easy to move after all. You should do what pro movers do, hook larger chairs around corners to make moving them easier. Just turn the chair on its side to make an L-shape and move its back-first through the doorway. Curl (hook) the chair around the doorway to allow it to slip through.\n\n**Carry tall furniture using a high-low technique**\n\nA tall shelving unit or cabinet can be awkward to move. To prevent injuring your back, consider getting the help of your partner. Tip them backward at an angle and carry the top while the other person carries the bottom.\n\nDoing so will center the weight of the piece, and keep it from swinging out of control and injuring you. This will also make it easier to carry the item down the stairs because the angle of carrying it will match the slope of the stairs.\n\n**Use shoulder dollies**\n\nThe lifting and moving straps make it easier to lift and move heavy furniture units without hurting your back. They force your body to rely on its large muscle groups. Moreover, they leave your hands free, allowing you to maneuver bigger items. However, they can be tricky while using the stairs because they shift the weight downwards for the mover.\n\n**Slide instead of dragging**\n\nYou can buy furniture sliders in different shapes and sizes. You can also make your own sliders using old rugs, bedspreads, plastic container covers, towels, etc. You can use them to avoid scratching the floors when dragging heavy furniture.\n\n**Stand couches on the end**\n\nWhile moving a couch through a door or hallway, it is impossible to carry it horizontally. The easiest way to move it is to place the couch on its end while in the hallway then slide it through the doorway. If the furniture is taller than the opening, ensure that the top end is away to allow a few inches of clearance.\n\n**Wrap furniture in blanket and plastic**\n\nIf you want to protect your house as well as your furniture, use blankets. You can either buy cheap ones online or rent them for a few dollars from your local store. To avoid ruining the fragile edges and finish, try to wrap them completely in moving blankets and use stretch film to secure the blanket.\n\n**Create a mattress sling**\n\nCarrying a heavy and floppy mattress is tough. Although most of them come with a handle, they are not meant for carrying. They are used for positioning the mattress, which means they are not very strong. To make the mattress easier to carry, you can use a simple rope string that gives you more freedom and control. Thread it through the handles and attach the rope to a PVC pipe for a more comfortable grip. Flip the mattress to ensure the sling is at the bottom, and start moving it.\n\n**Ask a friend to help**\n\nIf you feel you cannot move furniture alone, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help from your friend. If no one you know is available, you can consider hiring professional movers.\n\n**Invest in Right Equipment**\n\nInvesting in the right equipment makes your task two times simpler.

We like the look of a tile backsplash, and the cost of lumber has put some other projects (like a fence) on hold for now.\n\nThis project turned out to be quite affordable, even with having to buy several tools.\n\nThe tools and materials we had to get were (prices in Canadian dollars, and after 15% sales tax):\n\n-17.5 sq ft of tile. We bought 3\u201d x 12\u201d white tiles with a slight \u2018hammered\u2019 look to them. We thought this was a good balance of classic but with some texture. We purchased 30 sq foot, which turned out to be way too much, and will be returning the extra. Not sure the brand, purchased from The Paint Shop. $100\n\n-1 Gal Type 1 Mapei Tile Adhesive from The Paint Shop. $32\n\n-Schluter Strip. We got the Jolly, in Bright White. Also purchased from The Paint Shop, $6\n\n-10lbs bag of Mapei Ultracolor Plus FA grout in Pearl Grey. Purchased from The Paint Shop, for $32\n\n-Tube of matching Mapei Pearl Grey Caulking. Purchased from The Paint Shop for $24\n\n-Tile Spacers. I got 2 bags of 100 with 1/8\u201d spacing. Don\u2019t recall the brand and lost the receipt, but purchased from The Paint Shop for roughly $5\n\n-Tile Cutter. Borrowed from my father, so fortunately no cost.\n\n-Tile Saw. Powerfist Brand that I found on Facebook marketplace. Previous owner used it for two projects and had no use for it anymore. Also came with two new blades. Snagged this deal for $30!\n\n-Grout Float. Bought a medium firmness grout float from Kent for $14\n\n-Grout Sponge bought from Kent for $2\n\n-Grout mixer, bought from Kent for $11\n\n-5 Gal bucket. Could\u2019ve done with a smaller 2 gallon one. Also would recommend having three instead of 1. Bought from Kent for $5\n\n-Assorted other items like garbage bags, painters\u2019 tape, and various other tools that I already had.\n\n-Tile Nippers from Home Depot for $21\n\n-1/4\u201d square notch trowel from Home Depot. I\u2019d recommend a smaller notch for this size tile on a backsplash, which I\u2019ll explain later. $6\n\nTotal Materials Cost: $199\n\nTotal Tools Cost: $89\n\nTotal Cost: $288\n\n\nTiling:\n\nFirst steps were to clear our countertops of everything, wipe down our walls and counter, and then lay some garbage bags and tape them to the countertop as a drop sheet.\n\nMy Father came over to help me with tiling, since he at least had some limited experience working with tile before, even if it wasn\u2019t for a backsplash.\n\nRight off the bat, I wasn\u2019t sure where I should start. I knew I should start from the outside of the counter and work in, and we decided to start on the long wall first, but I wasn\u2019t sure whether to start tile at the edge of the counter or upper cabinet. After a quick google search, I found that you should start your tile at the edge of the upper cabinets, which fortunately meant no miter was needed to add a horizontal portion to the Schluter Strip.\n\nWe used a level and drew a line straight down from the upper cabinet to the countertop. This line would be the outside edge of our Schluter Strip. I then applied some tile adhesive and stuck on a piece of Schluter strip that I\u2019d trimmed down to size.\n\nFrom here, we could start applying more adhesive and begin with the tile! I started applying the adhesive and tile, while my father started trying to cut some in half using the tile cutter. It took a few tries, but we eventually got some to cut right down the middle. Once we had that, we used it as a guide for the next few.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after beginning to apply tiles that we came across a spot where a complicated cut would be required. The tile needed to have a \u201cU\u201d shape cut for a 3-gang wall plate, plus another \u201cU\u201d shape cut for a single wall plate that held a phone jack. We knew this would be difficult since the bottom edge of the tile would end up being so thin, and we had literally no experience at all with the tile saw at this point. I quickly decided we would just cover up the box for the phone jack; It didn\u2019t have an ethernet cable to use for internet, and who has a home phone anymore. Even with this decision made, we still broke 4 tiles trying to get the single 3-gang box cut out\u2026 until we decided to use the first broken tile anyways since the break was relatively easy to hide under the wall plate and not very noticeable. If we\u2019d had more experience with the saw, we probably could\u2019ve gotten this to work.\n\nWith that one stubborn tile up, and my father now having some feel for how the tile saw worked, we were good to continue tiling! I was attaching the tiles, and marking them for cuts, while my father did the cutting.\n\nSeveral more annoying cuts came up, including underneath the upper cabinets because the walls came down further than the back, and around the windowsill where we decided to try cutting out part of the sill to slide the tile behind on one side, and deciding to try cutting a rounded edge around the sill on the other side (cutting a notch from the sill provided a cleaner look). Unfortunately, all of the tiles underneath our cabinets and windowsill also had to be cut in half the long way.\n\nWe finished the wall, got some pizza for lunch, and then tackled the shorter wall behind the stove. We should have started with that wall in the first place. It allowed for significantly more full tiles without any cuts, and the cuts were simple. It would\u2019ve been a much better wall to start off on when trying to learn the tools and materials.\n\nAnd with that, the tiles were up!\n\nGrouting:\n\nThat night, I washed down the tiles several times and scraped away any excess adhesive in the gaps or on the face of any tiles. I wasn\u2019t sure if we would have a chance to do the grouting the next day or not, and didn\u2019t want to let the excess adhesive set up too much before getting around to grouting.\n\nThe grouting didn\u2019t happen the next day, so the day after that we got to it; this time without my father, it was just me and my partner.\n\nFrom watching videos and reading online, I was very worried about using the Mapei Ultracolor Plus grout, since I\u2019d heard it sets up so quickly. I\u2019d read that the Mapei Keracolor U was a better grout to work with as a first-time tiler \u2013 I looked around at a bunch of the hardware stores, and nobody carried the Keracolor line so I was just going to have to make do with the fast-setting Ultracolor.\n\nI mixed up a half bag at a time since I was told to only do one wall at a time due to the speed that it could set up. We started with the short wall this time since I realized it would be easier to learn on. I applied the grout, while my partner sponged off the excess.\n\nHonestly, I think the warnings I\u2019d read about this grout were overblown. We didn\u2019t end up waiting a full 15-30 minutes like the package said because of those warnings, but I was easily able to apply all the grout to the first wall, then help my partner to clean it all off with a second sponge. By the time we cleaned up the first wall, I probably could\u2019ve still done the long wall based on the consistency of the grout. Since I\u2019d only done half of the bag though, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was enough left in the bucket and I wanted to make sure the colour perfectly matched if the pigment wasn\u2019t distributed evenly in the bag. I scraped out the remainder of the first batch of grout and put it in a plastic bag as an emergency backup, and then mixed the other half of the bag. We applied this to the long wall, which proved to be more difficult as expected. With all the small spaces, the grout float and sponge were both too large to move around everything. It would\u2019ve been nice to have a smaller float and sponge for these spots.\n\nWith that, the grouting was basically done! I\u2019d come back a couple of times to wipe off any excess haze, but that was it! Much easier than the negative reviews made that grout sound like it would be.\n\nTo be fair though, I didn\u2019t turn the heat on so it was probably only 17 degrees C (62 F) inside while we worked, which could have slowed down the curing process.\n\nAlso, a tip\u2026 Make sure you don\u2019t lean onto the stove knobs, turning a burner on. It\u2019s especially bad if you\u2019ve got garbage bags laid over top, and a bucket of water also on it. Fortunately, we realized early enough that the only damage caused was the garbage bag being fused to our water bucket.\n\n\nCaulking:\n\nNext up was caulking. I hated this. Easily my least favorite part of the project.\n\nI thought it would be like doing the corners of a tub or shower, and I\u2019d just lay down a bead, wet my finger, and run it along getting a perfect curve. But nooo, try doing that and it smears all over your countertop and tile and since it\u2019s a contrasting colour, you see every imperfection!\n\nSo I tried doing the tape trick. Piece of tape along the wall, and piece along the countertop, then run your finger across, and pull up the tape. I\u2019ve got to admit, this did work well! But was best where you have long straight lines. On the many awkward corners I had in small places, the tape trick didn\u2019t really work. I\u2019m not happy with how some of them turned out, but they\u2019re doing to have to do for now.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nOverall, we\u2019re very happy with this project! It makes a huge difference to the look and feel of our kitchen, and was quite affordable, especially for the difference that it makes!\n\nTiling isn\u2019t that difficult if you get the tools for it, and I would recommend taking on a similar project yourself! Neither my partner nor I have much DIY experience, and we\u2019re still happy with the result, even knowing about all the imperfections.\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about the project, or give some tips and tricks to make it look better next time (if there ever is a next time).
