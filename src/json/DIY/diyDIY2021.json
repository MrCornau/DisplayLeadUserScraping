Poor quality, shitty material, and ugly. I want to do a custom wood desktop for the electric frame. Needs to be durable, lightweight, aesthetically pleasing, and preferably cheap. I think a darker type of wood would be great with a white underframe. Due to not owning milling tools/machines, I'm planning on buying lumber that's already surfaced. Based on my research, I think I'll need to glue several pieces of wood together with applied pressure. Might put a wireless charging pad into the wooden desktop.\n\nThe frame specs can support up to 154 pounds max load. This means the custom wooden desktop needs to be between 50 - 80 pounds giving us 104 - 74 pounds of wiggle room.\n\nMeasurement-wise, the custom wood desktop needs to be 63x31.5 and 1 to 1.5 inches thick. If we're running too heavy, we can cut the thickness down to .5 to .75. Thicker the better though. The finished product needs the edges to be \"smoothed\", sanded, stained, and a couple of generous coats of polyurethane.\n\nThis brings me to my questions below:\n\n1. What types of wood would you recommend? Needs to be aesthetically pleasing, durable, lightweight. Lower the cost the better.\n2. Do you have any suggested lumbermill or \"wood suppliers\" within the SoCal market? I'm located in Orange County, CA.\n3. Do you have a recommended type of stain?\n4. Do you have a recommended type of polyurethane?\n5. Do you have a recommended type of wood glue?\n6. Do you have a recommended screw length based on the suggested thickness?\n7. Do you have any tips for making this as light as possible?\n8. What general tools would you need to complete a project like this? Is there anything the lumber mill would need to complete onsite due to tool accessibility outside of milling? Planning on buying surfaced wood. I have the basics - sander, power drill, table saw, etc.\n\nAgain, I'm inexperienced but this is something I'd love to plan out and dive in head first as a weekend project.
