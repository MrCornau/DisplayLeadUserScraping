I am also a big fan of the industrial look, and I wanted to bring that style into my house.\n\nI really wish I took more photos of the whole process but unfortunately I didn\u2019t. So I will try my best to answer questions and fill in the gaps.\n\nI started off with 10\u201d junior c-channel stringers and welded some 1-1/2 angle iron brackets to it after doing the necessary calculations. These would eventually support the wooden stair treads. Temporary plywood treads were installed to prevent damage to the final wooden ones during the construction process. Cost of steel ~ $350. About 3-4h of welding and cleaning the steel since c-channel can be very scaly and needs a lot of elbow grease to clean it up.\n\nFor the treads I went with oak. Initially I was going to build these myself but ended up hiring a local wood shop to do them because I really didn\u2019t have enough space or the proper tools to achieve the quality I was looking for. The stairs look solid, but they are actually mostly hollow inside with few \u201cribs\u201d for reinforcement. With stain and sealer each step cost me about $200. Stairs were stained a dark walnut to match the color of the floors. On the bottom of each step I had a 3/4\u201d channel routed out for aluminum housing that would hold the LED strips. \n\nI chose the storage closet next to the staircase to house all the drivers for the lights. I used a Leviton structured media enclosure to keep everything neatly inside the wall between studs. Yes I now know that I did not need junction boxes for low voltage lighting, but at the time I was not aware of this, it doesn\u2019t really impact anything in any negative way just added a few unnecessary steps to the process. \n\nThe wires all feed into the wall and come out on the other side where they are hidden by the stringer against the wall. They are pulled through holes drilled next to every step and connect to LED strips that are glued into the aluminum housing under each step. The hardest part of this project was soldering all the leads to each strip. I initially went with clips but they were too bulky, hard to conceal and were prone to disconnecting. \nThe drivers, housing and LED are surprisingly cheap. The whole setup only cost me around $120 and around 3-4 hours to get everything soldered and routed.\n\nThe railing needed to complement the industrial aesthetic I was going for. This is my own design and it uses 1/2\u201d round bar \u201csandwiched\u201d between two strips of 1-1/2 x 1/4 flatbar. The posts are 1-1/2 x 1-1/2 x 065 HSS. Everything is powdercoated using Sherwin Williams Powdura Electric Black by a local shop.\n\nI initially wanted a metal top rail, but I ended up changing it to wood in order to soften up the look and to tie the railing in with the treads and hardwood flooring.  Top rail is also oak made by the same shop that did the stair treads. The wooden top rail is 2 x 1-1/4\u201d the bottom is routed 1/4\u201d x 1-1/2. The top of the metal railing got a solid 1-1/2 x 1/2 flatbar that was pre-drilled. The wood sits on top of of the steel and is secured using black Woodbinder screws through pre-drilled holes.\n\n\n\nCost of top rail ~$800, cost of steel ~$1000. Total time to weld clean and install around 10 hours. \n\nTotal project budget ended up being around $4,000 because I did most of the work myself and it took under a week of to complete (that\u2019s not counting the month or so that it took the wood shop to build the stair treads and top rail)\n\nThis was my very first time working with LED strips so I had to research and learn quite a bit along the way. Overall I am extremely happy with the way this turned out and I can officially say I now know more about LED lighting than my electrician. \n\nElectrical components purchase on Amazon. \nEverything else came from local businesses and vendors around the Puget Sound area.
