The RP can get GPS data from a smartphone via bluetooth. Can someone comment on how seamlessly this integration works? Is this is an \"always on\" connection or do I have to fiddle with the phone and the camera for every session? If it's an \"always on\" setting, any perspective on how it affects the battery life would be much appreciated too.\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/f9awy1/gps_tagging_in_eos_rp/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": true, "Selector": "tagging", "selectorShort": "tagging", "MarkedSent": "gps -----> tagging !!!  in eos rp /!/ hi everyone,\n\ni'm considering buying an eos rp for an upcoming cross-country trip and it would be nice to have gps metadata added to my phone automatically. the rp can get gps data from a smartphone via bluetooth. can someone comment on how seamlessly this integration works? is this is an \"always on\" connection or do i have to fiddle with the phone and the camera for every session? if it's an \"always on\" setting, any perspective on how it affects the battery life would be much appreciated too.\n\nthanks in advance!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 45867, "year": "2020"}], "name": "taggingcanon2020"}
