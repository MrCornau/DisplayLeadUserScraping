I was looking up stuff online for recommended lenses (blogs and lenshero) as well as going through the FAQ on r/photography; I came up with a couple potential lenses for my shooting purposes. My budget is around $500, so I based my choices off of that. If you have any recommendations besides the one I listed, please let me know. I would preferably like to choose two lens, one dedicated for landscape and one for general picture-taking. I would appreciate any comments and help!
