After years of wanting to get into film photography I\u2019m finally in a position to dabble a bit but I\u2019m still very new.

I am very new to film photography (Canon AE-1 came in this week!). I've already shot through one roll and am planning to send it off to [The Darkroom](https://thedarkroom.com).

After all, if you can say you're superior to someone else by saying \"Hoo hee hoo hee hoo, you don't NEED that\" without asking why they might think they DO need that(Maybe they're after stronger bokeh and want a faster lens, maybe they're after a larger sensor for, you know, about a DOZEN different reasons, but I digress), but there's something people tend NOT to look at when it comes to this examination of what makes a good photographer.  \n\n\nPresets.  \n\n\nBuying a batch of presets does Not make you a better editor and/or photographer.  \n\n\nNow, let me preface by saying that I'm not one of those types that say you should shoot for the final result out-of-the-camera. That sort of thinking shows a remarkable failure in understanding the use of tools, and a good understanding of how your camera body works can actually make shooting for the edit MUCH easier, and give you a LOT of freedom in terms of doing artistic things that were never intended by the manufacturer. Knowing that Canon bodies are terrible at recovering in the lows can help you know to expose slightly higher than normal, knowing that a bunch of MFT sensors don't recover highlights well can let you know that shooting a tiny bit lower than normal can be useful too. Knowing What your camera does with noise when you try to recover can help you make better decisions as to what to do in the edit, and shooting for the edit itself can, again, bring you far greater success in your end result...  \n\n\nIF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  \n\n\nWhat this DOESN'T mean is \"Buy a bunch of presets and rely on them like there's no tomorrow\". Don't get me wrong, presets are tools too, but if you're one of those people who buys a preset without having Any idea of what it's actually doing to your colors, or to your shot, or anything else along those lines, shows that A: you aren't great with your money, as dumping cash on a preset that may be easily enough reproduced by just knowing what it does in the first place ain't exactly money-smart(Make one yourself if you're gonna do this), and B: that you're just not that good with editing.  \n\n\nPhotography isn't just about pushing a button. It's about the whole job. As I tell students from time to time, \"Use the whole ass\". Don't half-ass your work. You wouldn't call yourself a photographer if you were half-assing the shoot, barely framing things in a functional, much-less aesthetically pleasing way, so why would you call yourself a photographer if you were going to half-ass your edit?  \n\n\nRelying so heavily on presets shows a lack of understanding of the fact that every image is a little different. I see people leaning heavily on presets and copy/pasted edit paths, and it really, really shows in the end result. People who copy/paste a result from a wide to a zoomed shot failing to take into account the difference in exposure between the two shots, people who use that ridiculously high contrast preset that makes everything look artificial, and yet, completely generic, the list goes on.  \n\n\nIf you're thinking of buying presets because you want to cut time off of your turnaround, chances are you need to, instead of finding ways to spend LESS time in your edit, find ways to spend More. Not because you need to spend more time on a single photo, but because you need to spend more time understanding how the process works.   \n\n\nSo I have an assignment for you. I used to use this assignment with students, and I found great success with it as far as getting students to reexamine how they not only handle an edit, but also how they learn over time.  \n\n\nGo find three photos you've taken. Each photo should be over a year old.   \nOne shot should be well exposed. Sharpness isn't SUPER important, but hey, if you've got it clean, great.  \nOne shot should be overexposed. Not to the point of complete washout, but enough that you're going to break your threshold a bit.  \nAnd the last should be underexposed.  \n\n\nGo all the way back to the Raws on these. Make a variant of the original edit without any changes from the shot as it came out of the camera. Now, apply what you know Currently, as opposed to what you know from that time, and retool each image to your current heart's content.  \n\n\nYou should be doing this whenever you've got off time.

After all, if you can say you're superior to someone else by saying \"Hoo hee hoo hee hoo, you don't NEED that\" without asking why they might think they DO need that(Maybe they're after stronger bokeh and want a faster lens, maybe they're after a larger sensor for, you know, about a DOZEN different reasons, but I digress), but there's something people tend NOT to look at when it comes to this examination of what makes a good photographer.  \n\n\nPresets.  \n\n\nBuying a batch of presets does Not make you a better editor and/or photographer.  \n\n\nNow, let me preface by saying that I'm not one of those types that say you should shoot for the final result out-of-the-camera. That sort of thinking shows a remarkable failure in understanding the use of tools, and a good understanding of how your camera body works can actually make shooting for the edit MUCH easier, and give you a LOT of freedom in terms of doing artistic things that were never intended by the manufacturer. Knowing that Canon bodies are terrible at recovering in the lows can help you know to expose slightly higher than normal, knowing that a bunch of MFT sensors don't recover highlights well can let you know that shooting a tiny bit lower than normal can be useful too. Knowing What your camera does with noise when you try to recover can help you make better decisions as to what to do in the edit, and shooting for the edit itself can, again, bring you far greater success in your end result...  \n\n\nIF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  \n\n\nWhat this DOESN'T mean is \"Buy a bunch of presets and rely on them like there's no tomorrow\". Don't get me wrong, presets are tools too, but if you're one of those people who buys a preset without having Any idea of what it's actually doing to your colors, or to your shot, or anything else along those lines, shows that A: you aren't great with your money, as dumping cash on a preset that may be easily enough reproduced by just knowing what it does in the first place ain't exactly money-smart(Make one yourself if you're gonna do this), and B: that you're just not that good with editing.  \n\n\nPhotography isn't just about pushing a button. It's about the whole job. As I tell students from time to time, \"Use the whole ass\". Don't half-ass your work. You wouldn't call yourself a photographer if you were half-assing the shoot, barely framing things in a functional, much-less aesthetically pleasing way, so why would you call yourself a photographer if you were going to half-ass your edit?  \n\n\nRelying so heavily on presets shows a lack of understanding of the fact that every image is a little different. I see people leaning heavily on presets and copy/pasted edit paths, and it really, really shows in the end result. People who copy/paste a result from a wide to a zoomed shot failing to take into account the difference in exposure between the two shots, people who use that ridiculously high contrast preset that makes everything look artificial, and yet, completely generic, the list goes on.  \n\n\nIf you're thinking of buying presets because you want to cut time off of your turnaround, chances are you need to, instead of finding ways to spend LESS time in your edit, find ways to spend More. Not because you need to spend more time on a single photo, but because you need to spend more time understanding how the process works.   \n\n\nSo I have an assignment for you. I used to use this assignment with students, and I found great success with it as far as getting students to reexamine how they not only handle an edit, but also how they learn over time.  \n\n\nGo find three photos you've taken. Each photo should be over a year old.   \nOne shot should be well exposed. Sharpness isn't SUPER important, but hey, if you've got it clean, great.  \nOne shot should be overexposed. Not to the point of complete washout, but enough that you're going to break your threshold a bit.  \nAnd the last should be underexposed.  \n\n\nGo all the way back to the Raws on these. Make a variant of the original edit without any changes from the shot as it came out of the camera. Now, apply what you know Currently, as opposed to what you know from that time, and retool each image to your current heart's content.  \n\n\nYou should be doing this whenever you've got off time. If you're not learning and practicing, you're wasting time. If you find yourself editing it in the exact same way, you've already failed the assignment. If you feel like it looks \"Good\" based on how you edited it before? Whatever tool in the edit that you relied on the most before, don't use it. At all. If you're leaning on HDR controls, don't touch them. If you're leaning on color balance wheels, leave them alone. If you're hitting the curves graph for most of it, stop.

I have thoughts, and questions. (NFSW blood) /!/ So, I recently (about a year ago) was gifted a a DSLR camera, and a few pretty nice lenses. I have an idea of what would make for a good picture based on seeing it, but I'm not at a point where I can say \"Ok, we need this setting of aperture, we need this shutter speed, we need this lens, we need this ISO, we need this flash setting...\" ect ect ect.\n\nI'm also a fan of professional wrestling. So I took my camera to this event, and I had some problems. 9/10 of my photos were blurry. So I read up on it, and they said to change the shutter speed to faster. \n\nSo I did that, and now everything was black. They said \"use a flash\", but the problem is, we're in an environment that's so wide open and being shot from so far away, that a flash won't be able to really affect the shot. \n\nThe shots I've taken at a slower shutter speed at the bottom of this post are pretty representative of how it looks in the room as far as light levels. It's not a dark environment. \n\nI've been told to use 1/60 to capture motion. However, even with the Fstop open fully, and even with the ISO at it's highest setting, 1/60 in this environment makes my pictures pure black. \n\nIs there something I'm missing? Also, you can take a look at some of my favorite shots at the bottom of this post. Some of the later shots do have blood. Professional wrestling may be fixed, but contrary to assumption, they don't use blood packs or ketchup. They use razor blades against their own forehead. They take some blood thinners before the match sometimes, although I don't think that was done in the shots I took. Just the razor. \n\nNone of these photographs have been photoshopped in any way. I was shooting in JPEG mode, not Raw. Theres one picture where it looks like a cartoon zooming in. That was done by accident. I was actually trying to manually adjust the zoom, when my finger accidentally pressed the button to take a picture while I was adjusting zoom. That one photo is the end result. It's a cool effect, but I'm afraid to try it again. I don't know if that ruins the camera, or the lens. \n\nI can't afford additional equipment. What I have is what I have.....that being said, I was given quite a lot. I'll update this post later with a full listing of equipment, but for right now I'll just say I have a Nikon D60, a really short lens, two lens's that look like default len's, and one really long lens, that says 55-300 on it, which I guess is important for the zoom. I guess 300 is the farthest zoom it can do. I was also given a really nice flash attatchment, and some filters that screw on the lens that I have no idea what they're for. My mom is also letting me borrow a crapton of lens filters which I also have zero clue on what they do.\n\nIt took me 2 hours to cherry pick these select pictures that I'm somewhat proud of, because the rest of them were blurry. I took about 3000 pictures between two wrestling shows. \n\nI assure you, if the picture looks cool, I probably thought it was going to be a cool picture but had no idea how to actually take the picture THAT good. So in essence, a lot of these cool looking pictures are one part instinct and 10 parts luck. Except for that cool looking zoomy picture. That was pure accident, but it may be my favorite picture I took. \n\nI'll be adding to the imgur post later. I went to the beach the other day to take some practice pictures.
