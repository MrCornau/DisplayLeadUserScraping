I used it three times before the pandemic: at my own wedding, and then two holiday parties. It's still a work in progress, but hopefully this can help / inspire someone to get their own set up. \n\nCamera: Kind of irrelevant, but I know someone will ask. This picture was with a 7D mkII and 10-22mm, I think at 22mm (I just have the JPG and not in front of my LR catalog right now), f/8 and 1/200. I liked the wide angle look for the photo booth, even though I wouldn't normally use it for portraits, but this setup would really work with whatever you have. \n\nLights: Really just one big key light. I ganged up two 580EX ii and one 430EX ii in a triple flash umbrella bracket (inexpensive Impact from B&amp;H), in a Neewer 48\" Octabox (Amazon). Set it up on-axis and as high as I could given the ceilings in a given setup, angled down as needed to hit the subjects. Triggering was a third 580EX ii in the hot shoe. Theoretically could've used the 7D's built-in flash as the master, but with the other speedlites in a softbox, they don't see the triggering light as well, and I was able to actually tuck the 580 into the bottom of the softbox (it's a velcro front panel). I've also just bought the Phottix Laso triggering system, so in future uses I'll use radio. \n\nSetup: Background is something cheap I got on Amazon. Background stand is an Impact kit from B&amp;H.  Camera was mounted on a tripod and snugged up under the softbox, so roughly at head height, with a remote shutter release hung over a light stand near the subjects and a 3 second delay. This gave the subjects time to hit the shutter release, put it down, and pose before the picture was taken. I found the wired shutter release more reliable than the little infrared RC-6; if you have a bluetooth-capable camera the new bluetooth remote (BR-1?) might work better. It might also wander off if you don't tie it down... Anyway. Camera was shooting tethered with Lightroom CC, saving photos to a specific folder on the laptop. This folder was monitored by a free slideshow app I found, which would display the new photo full-screen as soon as it saw a new one, and then resume cycling through the other photos that had been taken that evening. In later implementations, I also synced the folder to my web server, and put a QR code on the \"Photo Booth instructions\" poster, so that people could go straight to that page and download their photos to their phones in real time. \n\nRegrets: Using TTL. I'm used to using it because I'm usually pretty mobile, and it didn't really occur to me that the lighting conditions weren't changing at all here. (I'm using the excuse that the first implementation was my own wedding and this was a very low priority, and after that I was on autopilot). The TTL got tricked by different costumes, and even different poses blocking or exposing more reflective parts of the sequined background, and I ended up with some over- or under-exposed shots. Next time it'll be manual flash. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, C&amp;C totally welcomed.
