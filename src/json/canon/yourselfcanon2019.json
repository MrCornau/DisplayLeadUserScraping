In total I have 500 or so registered with them (though I don't think I have registered cases with more than 50-60 of them). \n\nMy total income from Pixsy this year is $30K, and that's for a really minimal amount of work on my end. I've certainly not received payouts from every single infringer, not even close, but registering for US copyright seems to have helped the amount of cases being successfully cleared, and Pixsy are honest-to-God actually moving to sue 10+ infringers on my behalf, most of them through the local office they're using in Japan. \n\nThe major downside with pixsy is that they claim to be active in a bunch of European jurisdictions, but I've never been able to submit any infringement from any European country except the UK and the Netherlands (and I've never had a successful case in NL). I know Copytrack are more effective in that part of the world (as a friend's company got caught by a photographer using them once). Pixsy is really only effective in the Anglophone world + Japan. When it comes to Japan specifically though they are INCREDIBLY efficient, I think I've actually received compensation for every case I've submitted there (minus the ones they'll be suing). Actually, Japanese cases are responsible for I think 50% of my payouts (despite only constituting maybe 10-20% of my submitted cases)\n\nThe other big negative is that their website is clunky and limited, but it's at least improved a lot over the year, submitting cases is a breeze compared to before, you had to do 20+ mouse clicks per submission, now it's down to like 4. \n\nRegistering US copyright through them was I think more than twice as expensive as doing it yourself, but it was worth it, they dealt with everything and I didn't have to manually add the info/registration numbers for 500-ish photos through their clunky website. Registering the photos also meant my payouts went up a lot, now I think the average I get (i.e. 50%) is maybe $350 or so per infringement, earlier, I think the average was maybe $100 or so (once, I just got $30 for an infringement, lol).\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with them, but I think you need to have A LOT of infringements to fall back on for them to be effective. The chance of a successful outcome on any random case is probably less than 25% and that's WITH US copyright registered, and it's even less without. So you know, I don't think it's for every photographer, and not for every type of infringement. If you definitely want money from a particular infringer that's not based in the US or Japan, you might be better served finding a lawyer in that jurisdiction who can help you out. If you have a bunch of photos with a bunch of infringements and don't particularly care all that much about who gets squeezed and who doesn't, and you want a nice side income without having to actually deal with any of the nasty stuff going on in the sausage factory, I think they're pretty awesome.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/k9jt7u/1_year_experience_with_pixsy_made_over_30k_so_far/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "doing it yourself", "selectorShort": "yourself", "MarkedSent": "1 year experience with pixsy - made over $30k so far from 500 photos /!/ i've been using the us find-photo-infringer service pixsy for a little over a year now and have received payouts on a bunch of infringements they pursued, all for photos on cc-by or cc-by-sa licenses. in total i have 500 or so registered with them (though i don't think i have registered cases with more than 50-60 of them). \n\nmy total income from pixsy this year is $30k, and that's for a really minimal amount of work on my end. i've certainly not received payouts from every single infringer, not even close, but registering for us copyright seems to have helped the amount of cases being successfully cleared, and pixsy are honest-to-god actually moving to sue 10+ infringers on my behalf, most of them through the local office they're using in japan. \n\nthe major downside with pixsy is that they claim to be active in a bunch of european jurisdictions, but i've never been able to submit any infringement from any european country except the uk and the netherlands (and i've never had a successful case in nl). i know copytrack are more effective in that part of the world (as a friend's company got caught by a photographer using them once). pixsy is really only effective in the anglophone world + japan. when it comes to japan specifically though they are incredibly efficient, i think i've actually received compensation for every case i've submitted there (minus the ones they'll be suing). actually, japanese cases are responsible for i think 50% of my payouts (despite only constituting maybe 10-20% of my submitted cases)\n\nthe other big negative is that their website is clunky and limited, but it's at least improved a lot over the year, submitting cases is a breeze compared to before, you had to do 20+ mouse clicks per submission, now it's down to like 4. \n\nregistering us copyright through them was i think more than twice as expensive as -----> doing !!!  -----> it !!!  -----> yourself !!! , but -----> it !!!  was worth -----> it !!! , they dealt with everything and i didn't have to manually add the info/registration numbers for 500-ish photos through their clunky website. registering the photos also meant my payouts went up a lot, now i think the average i get (i.e. 50%) is maybe $350 or so per infringement, earlier, i think the average was maybe $100 or so (once, i just got $30 for an infringement, lol).\n\noverall, i'm very happy with them, but i think you need to have a lot of infringements to fall back on for them to be effective. the chance of a successful outcome on any random case is probably less than 25% and that's with us copyright registered, and it's even less without. so you know, i don't think it's for every photographer, and not for every type of infringement. if you definitely want money from a particular infringer that's not based in the us or japan, you might be better served finding a lawyer in that jurisdiction who can help you out. if you have a bunch of photos with a bunch of infringements and don't particularly care all that much about who gets squeezed and who doesn't, and you want a nice side income without having to actually deal with any of the nasty stuff going on in the sausage factory, i think they're pretty awesome.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 72857, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "CatBenchKettle", "date": "2019-12-07 16:55:37", "content": "Colourising - Best way to do it? /!/ Afternoon all, I was wondering if someone could help me with a problem.\n\nI\u2019d like to get a couple of old pictures colourised for my nan as a gift.

Also I'm on mobile so the formatting might be shit, sorry*)\n\n This guide is meant as a help to anyone who encountered the following problems: 'My film roll came out completely translucent/opaque' and 'Some frames are not exposed at all'. Let's start : \n\nCondition A: If your film comes back completely translucent then it (in theory) has never seen the light of day. Or it could be a very specific development mishap which I will explain at the end of this section. This can have a good number of reason, ranging from forgetting to take the lens cap off to camera failure and said development mistake. \n\nCondition B: If some frames are normal while others are completely blank, then you can simply ignore point one in the following list. Your problem most likely stems from camera/meter failure or forgetting to take off the lens cap. You can also skip the development part then if you wish. We'll start with the camera: \n\n**First**: Film loading. Was the film properly loaded ? This happens mostly with 135 film. If the film isn't properly wound onto the take-up spool it will snap back. To avoid this make sure that the film is wound firmly upon the take-up spool and the sprockets engage with the gears. There's nothing wrong with wasting a few frames just to make sure the film is properly loaded. Additionally if you're unsure whether or not the film is loaded correctly but don't want to open the back, you can simply advance the film one time. If the rewind knob rotates while you advance the film then it is properly loaded, this applies mostly to cameras with manual film advance. \n\n**Second**: Camera Failure. Check the shutter, does it successfully complete its cycle ? If not then the shutter needs repair. For your negatives to come out completely translucent the shutter does not open at all. Additionally, for SLRs, check if the mirror swings up too. Check all speeds of the shutter if possible. In some cases the shutter may not work on some/one specific speed(s). Additionally for cameras with automatic diaphragms/apertures, make sure that the diaphragm/aperture opens and stops down correctly. \n\n**Third**: Metering Issues. If your camera has an internal meter check its function by comparing its read-out with another camera or better a dedicated meter. If the values differ drastically by several stops, your cameras internal meter is malfunctioning. Also check your meters settings. There's almost nothing to be saved from an ISO 1600 roll that was shot at ISO 100. So check your ISO-setting ! This applies to both external and internal meters. \n\n*Another thing of note: Some cameras, especially late 90's Point-and-Shoots, won't allow the use of non DX-coded film. They will most likely set the internal meter to a standard setting, in most cases ISO 100. Some of said late cameras can only read DX-Coded film up to a certain speed. Make sure to read your cameras manual in such cases.*\n\n**Fourth**: Don't forget to take the lens cap off. This might not seem a problem to the SLR crowd but happens especially to literally anyone that uses a camera where you do not directly look through the lens, i.e. anything that isn't an SLR.\n\n **Development mishaps**: \n\nIf everything on your camera works and the lens cap was indeed taken off, then take a good look at the negatives themselves as well as the development process (assuming you did it yourself) . For black and white I shall link you to Ilford's excellent guide which deals with those issues (and more) as well as provides reference images: https://www.ilfordphoto.com/common-processing-problems/?___store=ilford_brochure&amp;___from_store=ilford_uk \n\nNote: In the very minimal chance that your B&amp;W roll came back completely blank (no edge markings) from a lab, it is because the lab accidentally threw your roll into same batch as for color film and developed in C-41. Get into contact with your lab immediately. \n\nBlank rolls (with **no** edge markings) can also happen with the C-41 process, it might have the following reasons: \n\n1.Fixing happened before developing. You might have accidentally used the blix first instead of the developer. \n\n2.Your developer is completely exhausted. The fixer  simply removes all of your emulsion. \n\nTo make sure to get the best and longest life out of your chemicals store them in plastic bottles and press out as much air as possible. This applies to all types processing chemicals. \n\nTo make sure your chemicals (BnW and C-41) are still OK develop a test strip.\n\n**SOME MORE USEFUL LINKS AND OTHER HELPFUL STUFF**\n\n https://www.butkus.org/chinon/ Probably the largest **free** camera manual library in the Internet.

Essentially, they boil down to a technical signal that your website is secure for browsing and that your visitor\u2019s data and information is safe and secure from vulnerabilities. They\u2019re the symbols of Internet security.\n\nInternet security is a much talked about term these days, thanks in part to big businesses that have been in the media due to data breaches. What\u2019s more, visitors are used to expecting security when conducting credit card transactions online. Beyond that, Internet security is something many web visitors and businesses take for granted. So, it may have been surprising when way back in 2014 Google admitted that HTTPS had become a [ranking factor](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) for websites. But, when Google says something is helpful, everyone jumps on board. Beyond being a helpful factor for SEO and ranking, having a secure website is good business practice. HTTPS and SSL is important. Today we\u2019re going to review why you need it, how it works and how to get it installed on your website.\n\nThink about your place of business. Your employees have keys and your guests cannot enter until the doors have been opened or they\u2019ve been let in. If you are part of a really large organization, the employees may have badges or nametags for identification. If you were to lose your keys or identification, your business would be left vulnerable. Your business has implemented security measures to keep the actual office safe, but also to protect important documents and data, right?\n\nWell, the same is true for a website. Years ago, websites were basically an online version of a business card. There wasn\u2019t much data being exchanged and visitors were merely browsing. Then the onset of websites came where you could login and become a member. Or, you could shop and make a purchase. Or, you could fill out a form to sign up for important information. With that, all of a sudden your digital footprint that followed you around the Internet started to hold all sorts of data.\n\nNow, while you browse the web you are basically a walking billboard of information about yourself, unless you keep everything secure. Businesses can help protect your data by ensuring their own websites are security compliant.\n\nInternet users have been slowly trained to look for an \u2018s\u2019 next to the HTTP as a signal that a website is secure for browsing and exchanging information. While most Internet users don\u2019t understand the technicalities of HTTPS and SSL they know what can happen if their sensitive information is breached. Perhaps their banking system has already been compromised and they\u2019ve had to deal with the hassle of ordering new cards and updating information. Perhaps their social media accounts have been hacked and they\u2019ve had to spend precious time cleaning things up and resetting passwords. More and more people are expecting security from the websites they visit, and if they don\u2019t find it, they leave.\n\nWhat is Https?\n--------------\n\nThe \u2018s\u2019 in HTTPS stands for \u2018secure\u2019. When you see this in a URL, coupled with a lock symbol, you know the website you are visited is encrypted with a secure website connection. Historically, SSL was reserved primarily for websites that collected private information such as passwords, private data and credit cards. When you visit a website without the \u2018s\u2019 you could be on a compromised network, or one that is vulnerable to hackers, the Internet\u2019s version of eavesdroppers.\n\nHTTPS helps protect the privacy of your website visitor. It is no longer enough for you to say you will protect a visitor\u2019s information. Now you must show you are protecting it.\n\nHTTPS makes it harder for hackers to break the connection and steal personal information.\n\nWhen browsing the web, look for the \u2018s\u2019 to know that the website you\u2019re on is trustworthy. Not all websites have converted over to HTTPS yet, so [if you are browsing a site that is not secure](https://seoexpertbrad.com/google-ssl-certificates-https/), just be sure to refrain from passing along your important personal information and data.\n\n**What is an SSL Certificate?**\n\nAn SSL certificate is the indication that your website is officially secure. This is what allows your website browser to establish a secure connection. The browser trusts the secure connection, which in turn a user can also feel safe browsing and even providing private/confidential information.\n\nOur official SSL partner is DigiCert, a leading SSL certificate authority. We recommend them because they provide increased speed and load time which is also a valuable SEO feature.\n\nWhy You need it?\n----------------\n\nInternet visitors are more savvy and have an innate trust associated with HTTPS. Recent media reports of big brands being hacked, compromised and having personal data leaked has made consumers even more cautious. We side with Google on this one and would like to see every website properly secured. It\u2019s especially important if you collect credit card payments, you collect private information (such as name, address, health records, passwords etc.) or you are in a competitive market. Here are other reasons why you should consider HTTPS for your website:\n\n  - Google now uses HTTPS as an important ranking factor and sites with it tend to rank better. This in itself is an important reason to ensure your website is secure and compliant with HTTPS. With a lot of competition on the Internet, your business should be great at the basics.\n  - Some popular Internet browsers are giving warnings when web visitors try and access a non-secure website. Therefore, if your site is not secure, you could be missing out on valuable website traffic. In fact, these warnings might just scare your website visitors away.\n  - Ensuring your website is secure protects your business from the costs of a data breach. This could be a public relations nightmare if your website data was ever breached, not to mention an expensive nightmare, too.\n  - Visitors are more confident using your website if they know it is secure. As visitors become more confident in their website browsing they have expectations of businesses, including website and data security.\n\n\u201cHTTPS Everywhere\u201d is a term coined by Google. Google has confirmed that HTTPS is a ranking factor dating back to 2014. \u201cSecurity is a top priority for Google\u2026 beyond our own stuff, we\u2019re also working to make the Internet safer more broadly. A big part of that is making sure that websites people access from Google, are secure\u2026 so we\u2019re starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal\u2026\u201d\n\nHistorically, only pages or parts of a website that dealt with sensitive data were secured with an SSL certificate. But, now it is advantageous to secure every single page. In other words, only when an entire website is properly secured with SSL will it earn a ranking advantage.\n\nAre All SSL Certificates Created Equal?\n---------------------------------------\n\nNo! Many of the SSL certificates online are SHA-1 which gets more compromised each year. In fact, Google Chrome may even display a warning on websites with SHA-1.\n\nSHA-2 is a much stronger certificate. If you want to ensure your website is deemed trustworthy you can even obtain an SSL EV certificate.\n\nIn addition, it is important to regularly check your SSL certificate to ensure it is not vulnerable. Improperly installed or misconfigured [SSL certificates](https://www.1stonthelist.ca/seo/other-services/#ssl) can leave you open to attack.\n\nWe provide a complimentary Inspector Report. Ask us for it!\n\n**The SSL Handshake \u2013 How SSL Works**\n\nHow does your web browser know a website is secure? Well, it undertakes what is commonly referred to as the SSL Handshake.\n\n  - The Internet browser connects to the web server and requests the server to identify itself.\n  - The server sends a copy of its SSL Certificate\n  - The browser verifies the certificate to ensure it is valid. If the browser trusts the certificate it creates an encrypted symmetric session key using the server\u2019s public key.\n  - The server decrypts the symmetric session key using its private key and sends back an acknowledgement to start the encrypted session.\n  - Server &amp;browser are now encrypted.\n\nHow to Purchase and Install an SSL Certificate\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBecause SSL and HTTPS is more important than ever, installation is best left to the professionals. While you can do it yourself, or have it done through your hosting provider you want to be sure that all configurations are correct and that your website is not vulnerable to insecurities.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nSo, while SSL and HTTPS is essentially good business practice, it is something users are looking for when they visit a website.\n\nHTTPS and SSL are the equivalent of a lock on a door or a code on a safe. Now more than ever it\u2019s important to be secure. The same is true for a website. Internet users are vulnerable when they browse the Internet. They have private data, cookies and Internet session info following along with them. In addition, they make credit card transactions, utilize banking websites, enter their personal data such as their full name and address, and are constantly logging in and out or signing up for things with usernames and passwords. Without security, we\u2019d all be victims of fraud and identity theft by now. That\u2019s why, even when you aren\u2019t conducting a financial transaction, it\u2019s wise to look for websites that are HTTPS.\n\nAnd, if Google is using it as a ranking factor then it is just all the more reason to jump on board the security bandwagon. But, not all s\u2019s are created equally. Even if you\u2019re only obtaining the certificate to appease Google, it\u2019s important to ensure that your SSL and security is set up and configured correctly. After all, the real goal is to ensure that your website visitors are safe while browsing your website. After all, a data breach could cost your business time, money and reputation!\n\nBeyond the visitor\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s just good business to ensure your website provides adequate security. And if it\u2019s going to help with your SEO, well that\u2019s great too.\n\nWebsite visitors do not always understand the technicalities of what goes on behind the scenes of a website. They don\u2019t understand how their data is encrypted. But, they know the hassle that comes when they\u2019ve become vulnerable to an attack, have been hacked or have had their information compromised. What they do know is that the S that is part of HTTPS and the lock in the browser is the best indication they have that a business is doing everything it can to protect their sensitive information. So, if you haven\u2019t yet adopted HTTPS, perhaps it\u2019s time you did.\n\nIf you still have questions about getting your website secure with SSL certificate, please call our SEO experts here at
