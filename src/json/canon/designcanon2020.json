On my other canon DSLRs when I have the quick menu up (i think that is what it is called) I can still adjust the shutter and aperture and press the Q button when I want to adjust something else. On the M5 when this screen is up I can only adjust what the orange box is highlighted. I can\u2019t figure out what to press to get rid of the orange box so I can just aperture and shutter without putting the camera or switching to live view. Is this how it is my design?
