It's been fun, 99% of the photos I take myself and edit myself. On occasion I collaborate with someone like a boyfriend, friend, or photographer on something. \n\nLast year, I designed and hand-made a dress to be nearly identical to one that Audrey Hepburn wore in an early photo in Kew Gardens. I put together the whole outfit, and when I went to London, my plan was to go there either with a tripod or a friend and make my recreations. A newer friend of mine (we met because of a mutual ex-boyfriend) volunteered her teenage son to help take the photo, since he likes photography. \n\nWe met at the park, and we started looking for the locations where the photos in Audrey's photo session were taken. I handed him my camera, and I and his mom would check the pictures on my phone to double check the angles and the poses. I ended up with three photos on my 'to do' list, which I then took home and edited, and shared on Instagram, of course thanking them for their help.\n\nCut to this year, another friend was working with a publisher on a book on Audrey Hepburn and really wanted to include some photos of me in the introduction. I sent over 9 of my favourites, including one from Kew. He decided on two that I had edited myself into, which were taken in the 1950's and 1960's. I assume he did whatever needed done to clear those. And the third was one from Kew. \n\nNow, the whole time before this, I've been very good at giving photographers credit, but for some reason it just never crossed my mind, this whole time. It's been a stressful year - I moved from California to France, and then went on a 3 month road trip (with my cat) between five countries. Then I spent a month apartment-hunting, and then trying to furnish the place. I've been extremely forgetful. I'll find emails I failed to reply to from 3 months ago. Anyway when I posted a photo of the page in the book, it was *then* that it was brought to my attention. I freaked the hell out and had a panic attack. I didn't mean to do that to my friends who had helped me create this picture I love. I was a wreck. I wrote her an apology message (which she still hasn't replied to, 5 days later) and then basically posted on IG that I had to take a mental health break for a while. I couldn't deal. For 3 days. Just couldn't eat, couldn't do much of anything, but I decided to limit my social media, and anything unnecessary, start looking for a therapist, do *anything* I could do for myself because I don't even feel in control of my own brain at this point. Anyway I got it together and wrote her son a long apology on Friday, and told him what I would try to do to fix it, and to make it up to him. Still no response. But now my friend who used the photo for the book (who hadn't seemed concerned up until this point, calling it an 'assisted self-portrait', and I don't know, he's dealt with photos for decades, he's a collector and author and worked at the National Portrait Gallery) said that the kid has sent an angry email to his publisher, which wasn't very cool.\n\nSide note. My own personal issue here is WTF would they not even talk to me privately but rather make public posts, share it with their friends who call me horrible names, and then email the publisher but never even try to clear it up with me first. \n\nBut my legal question (and sorry it took me this long to write this, but UGGGGG) is who owns this photo? I mean I was thinking about it today and honestly, I would be kind of pissed if HE used it without telling me, or asking me. Because it's my project, my series, I put way more effort into creating the photo than he did (I spent DAYS making the dress), he has no use for it, and I basically just handed him my camera. If you handed a friend your camera and directed them on how to take the picture, how can they possibly claim that it's 'theirs'? Personally, yes, I would appreciate a credit if someone used the photo I took of them, but I certainly wouldn't stop them from using it if they were the ones to conceive it and do all the work to create it. This is MY photo. Now he's trying to limit what I can do with it, just because he stood there and pushed the button. I have another friend who told me to do whatever I wanted with the photos she took of me. We're friends and it's for fun. Now of course when I work with a photographer and sign a release, I get that I have to ask them first. But I'm 99% sure we did not sign a release (I'll leave 1% of doubt because I'm forgetful and haven't dug through my papers. But in my moving process I don't recall coming across one for that day).

i mean i was thinking about it today and honestly, i would be kind of pissed if he used it without telling me, or asking me. because it's my project, my series, i put way more effort into creating the photo than he did (i spent days making the dress), he has no use for it, and i basically just handed him my camera. if you handed a friend your camera and directed them on how to take the picture, how can they possibly claim that it's 'theirs'? personally, yes, i would appreciate a credit if someone used the photo i took of them, but i certainly wouldn't stop them from using it if they were the ones to conceive it and do all the work to create it. this is my photo. now he's trying to limit what i can do with it, just because he stood there and pushed the button. i have another friend who told me to do whatever i wanted with the photos she took of me. we're friends and it's for fun. now of course when i work with a photographer and sign a release, i get that i have to ask them first. but i'm 99% sure we did not sign a release (i'll leave 1% of doubt because i'm forgetful and haven't dug through my papers. but in my moving process i don't recall coming across one for that day). if he's going to start a fight over who can use my photo, oh yeah i'm going to fight him. but hell, if he's going to be such an asshole about it, i'll just go back and take new photos there next time i'm in london. \n\ni'm definitely feeling bad about not acknowledging him, but i'm also getting pretty annoyed right now at the way they're dealing with this. i need some input, please!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 77793, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "amellice", "date": "2020-12-15 18:57:46", "content": "Saal Digital Photobook Review /!/ Hi all, I've recently ordered a photobook from Saal Digital which is a German print house, and wanted to share my thoughts with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was looking for a printing house to print a portfolio photo book, I stumbled on Saal Digital which is a German print house that offers high quality prints and photo books. I've never tried Saal Digital before and having tried a different bunch of other print houses,\u00a0I decided to give Saal Digital a try. I printed 130 pages 12x8.5 photo book from the professional line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0ba8hnrde561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07b11fc99019899aba90a1cfef75105542f45363\n\n# Design\n\nThere are different choices of formats, surface finish, page thickness, and even a gift box that wraps your book. I chose the Professional Line photobook with the black leather cover surface and went for the glossy finish.\n\nSaal Digital offers layout design software for both Mac OS and Windows where you can customize your book. This is the tool that I used to design, upload, and order my book. You can design your book with other software and upload it for printing as a PDF.\n\nI found the software to be very easy to use. You start out by designing the cover of the book including the back and the spine. Then you start adding pages where you can either choose a layout from existing presets or design your own (and save it if you want).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1ej6gsude561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178c6c35bead5c9a0b6f6892327dcf2e0039b592\n\nAs for the paper itself, Saal Digital [uses](https://www.saal-digital.com/support/article/overview-of-paper-density/) Fuji Crystal Archive paper. For each page, two papers will be glued back to back with a thickness of about 0.36mm per page. I personally love this paper and use it in my darkroom printing since it's widely available in sheets. It has beautiful color rendering with deep blacks and beautiful highlights.\n\nAs for color management, Saal Digital provides ICC color profiles that you can download and load into your image editing software to get a feeling of how the printed photos would look like. I found that the profile rendering stays very close to the exported sRGB JPEGs and the final print. You would get an accurate representation if your monitor is calibrated.\n\nAnother aspect that I liked is what Saal Digital calls \"Layflat Binding\" where you can print panorama on two pages and they would look (hopefully) flat. I've tried this with full two pages layout and over one page layout and they do look flat, however, one concern is to have a white line (eventually) in the binding area, but only time can tell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/211nol3zde561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a5225948192e483e48ad8a247cd60b8aefc09a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0ebe0nxde561.jpg?width=3792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175224f939c6e5181010f1d545f357fdfbf32048\n\n# Print Quality\n\nIt all comes down to print quality when I want to pick which print house to print my photos. Sure, easy tooling and process is a plus but the main factor is how good these prints look and how good the book overall look. Personally, I was impressed with Saal's final book and I'll break it down for you.\n\nAs for the cover, the leather cover felt premium and not cheap. It\u00a0has a non-noticeable nice smell. The binding of the book looks sturdy and shouldn't fall apart with careful use (only time will tell though). The spine looks fine and sturdy. You can print on the first page glued to the front and back cover if you choose to do so.\n\nThe pages themselves feel thick since they are two prints glued back to back together. The glossy finish obviously has a reflection to it (but which glossy paper that doesn't) and there's very minimal to no texture. Since it's resin-coated paper, it may feel plasticy to some people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmtntdx1ee561.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=066fecc03b9e23fc61d1d041b3d5f19c63982a65\n\nThe color rendering stayed very true to the original photos. I increased the exposure a bit (probably +1/3 stop) for some photos in post-processing while exporting photos used in this book. The prints look and feel very close to what I see on the screen and print personally on an Inkjet printer. Looking at the print above for an example, the highlights are intact and not pure white or blown away, there are some tones there. Shadows are not lost too, the subtle different tones are still rendered as I wanted which was quite surprising to me.\n\nLooking at the image below, it shows very subtle details in shadow areas (which may not be visible on a screen) like the dark trees area below the mountain in the center and some rock formations in this mountain also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2q5lc53ee561.jpg?width=3667&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87388d046a9f832643d8b915d950e59badadd1e1\n\nYou still get excellent deep blacks, like the following image shows where the sky looks black (which may not look so on a screen). The contrast of this print looks amazing, the white clouds on top of the mountains meet the dark black sky with zero color banding issues. This may be due to the continuous tone of RA-4 printing with this paper vs Inkjet printing for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lcqypo4ee561.jpg?width=3605&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c977474b37a488b3c2e4b75c99bde0b8cf61086e\n\nDeep shadows and subtle tones rendering looks amazing in color photographs too. Like the deep shadows below the dead tree and the blacks in the background mountains, while keeping the color rendering of the dark sky and the milky way true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cyh9s96ee561.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a05dc8d891dd78383cbbfe5ff72c038f53a4ce5\n\n# Summary\n\nAll in all, I was very pleased with the quality of the book and prints. The Professional Line Photobook product did indeed feel professional and premium. The color rendering is very good with truly deep blacks, subtle shadow, and highlight tones that really impress.\n\nThe one thing that I felt missing is offering other types of paper for books, as Fuji Crystal Archive glossy has high gloss and even the matt version has a bit of sheen to it, it may not suit all photos and people, especially if you're looking for something with texture. For me, I love the Crystal Archive paper and use it personally.\u00a0\n\nAnother thing to note is that I capped the max number of pages allowed at 130 pages. The software wouldn't let me add more pages after that.

Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my sister who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.\n\nYou just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend.\n\nI like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive.

Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life.

Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps &amp; is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.\n\nOther than drawing, I like reading whether it is newspaper, news, novels, G K book or any knowledgeable book written by any good author. I always read story books, newspaper, magazines, and any other material that I find interesting in my free time. This hobby of reading books of mine was first noticed by my father and he motivated me by saying that it is a very good habit given to you naturally, never let this habit off and keep it in practice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n   \n   \n from WordPress http://bit.ly/2WGWlx7", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/c025hb/its_my_blogso_its_me_time_now_my_hobbies/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "me to design", "selectorShort": "design", "MarkedSent": "its my blog\u2026.so its me time now\u2026 my hobbies /!/ my hobby is\n\n**cooking**\n=======\n\n**drawing**\n=======\n\n**listening music**\n===============\n\n_however i always prefer drawing._\n\nevery one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. similarly i love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. i cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. my greatest inspiration is my sister who always encourages -----> me !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> design !!!  her dresses. it is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.\n\nyou just have to make a unique piece. so get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.when i am blue i cheer myself up by drawing something so that i can make myself happy. drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. however drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. it needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. i can never feel bored when i have my colors with me. my colors are my best friend.\n\ni like drawing since i was 6 years old. i like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. i imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as hell &amp; demons, a beautiful house in heaven etc.i have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. drawing has now become the most important part of my life. but most of the times i am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. but still i manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.\u00a0 my leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush.\n\nthe strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. even when i was in school drawing was not my subject. i learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. i learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. i have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. with days my drawing improved step by steps &amp; is still improving. i constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.\n\nother than drawing, i like reading whether it is newspaper, news, novels, g k book or any knowledgeable book written by any good author. i always read story books, newspaper, magazines, and any other material that i find interesting in my free time. this hobby of reading books of mine was first noticed by my father and he motivated me by saying that it is a very good habit given to you naturally, never let this habit off and keep it in practice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n   \n   \n from wordpress http://bit.ly/2wgwlx7", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 5671, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "avenoir_fl", "date": "2019-07-14 19:19:25", "content": "I\u2019m looking for a photo to use as album art. /!/ Hi there Reddit, \n\nI\u2019m releasing a song tomorrow and I am having a hard time deciding what to use for album artwork.

As we enter a new generation of gaming, we see a future where you\u2019re instantly absorbed in your games \u2013 where worlds are even more lifelike, immersive, responsive and surprising \u2013 and where you are at the center of your gaming experience. With the new Xbox Series X, we will realize that vision.\u00a0\n\nXbox Series X will be our fastest, most powerful console ever and set a new bar for performance, speed, and compatibility, allowing you to bring your gaming legacy, thousands of games from three generations and more forward with you. Its industrial design enables us to deliver four times the processing power of Xbox One X in the quietest and efficient way, something that is critically important in delivering truly immersive gameplay. We also designed Xbox Series X to support both vertical and horizontal orientation. It\u2019s bold and unique, very much like our fans around the world and the team of collaborators and innovators who built it.\n\nThe name Xbox is an expression of our deep history in gaming, our team\u2019s unrelenting passion, and our commitment to both our fans and the future of gaming at Microsoft. It also signifies our belief that a gaming console should be for just that \u2013 gaming.\n\nAlongside Xbox Series X, we also unveiled the new Xbox Wireless Controller. Its size and shape have been refined to accommodate an even wider range of people, and it also features a new Share button to make capturing screenshots and game clips simple and a hybrid d-pad inspired by the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2. The new Xbox Wireless Controller will be compatible with Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs, and will be included with every Xbox Series X.\n\nThe possibilities of what Xbox Series X enables developers to achieve was also brought to life this evening with the unveiling of\u00a0_Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade II_. A sequel to the award-winning\u00a0_Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice_\u00a0from world-renowned developers Ninja Theory, the game is being built to leverage the full power of Xbox Series X.\u00a0 The footage shared tonight was captured in-engine and reflects the power of Xbox Series X available to developers to deliver new universes, experiences and games in ways you have never imagined.\n\n### **Bringing Developers\u2019 Dreams to Life with Xbox Series X**\n\nGames today deliver amazing visuals and tell an array of different and deep stories.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, when we started work on Xbox Series X, it was vital we continue to advance state-of-the-art visual capabilities for developers, while also ensuring they could realize even greater feeling, emotion, and empathy in their games. With Xbox Series X, we will elevate the way games look, play and feel. We will also remove the technical barriers faced in previous generations and enable developers to create more expansive, immersive gaming worlds that invite more players to play.\u00a0\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, this will manifest as world-class visuals in 4K at 60FPS, with the possibility of up to 120FPS, including support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and 8K capability. Powered by our custom-designed processor leveraging the latest Zen 2 and next-generation RDNA architecture from our partners at AMD, Xbox Series X will deliver hardware-accelerated ray tracing and a new level of performance never before seen in a console. \u00a0Additionally, our patented Variable Rate Shading (VRS) technology will allow developers to get even more out of the Xbox Series X GPU and our next-generation SSD will virtually eliminate load times and bring players into their gaming worlds faster than ever before.\n\nWe are minimizing latency by leveraging technology such as Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and giving developers new functionality like Dynamic Latency Input (DLI) to make Xbox Series X the most responsive console ever.\u00a0 Xbox Series X is also designed for a future in the cloud, with unique capabilities built into the hardware and software to make it as easy as possible to bring great games to both console and elsewhere. Xbox Series X will deliver a level of fidelity and immersion, unlike anything that\u2019s been achieved in previous console generations. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n### **One Console, Four Generations of Gaming**\n\nOne of the things we\u2019re most proud of with Xbox Series X is the promise we\u2019re delivering to our fans who have and continue to invest with Xbox. Thanks to backward compatibility, you can expect your gaming legacy, thousands of your favorite games across four generations of gaming, all your Xbox One gaming accessories, and industry-leading services like Xbox Game Pass to be available when you power on your Xbox Series X in Holiday 2020.\n\nBuilding on our compatibility promise, with Xbox Series X we\u2019re also investing in consumer-friendly pathways to game ownership across generations. Leading the way with our first-party titles including\u00a0_Halo Infinite_\u00a0in 2020, we\u2019re committed to ensuring that games from Xbox Game Studios support cross-generation entitlements and that your Achievements and game saves are shared across devices.\u00a0\u00a0As we branch out and extend gaming to more players around the world, console gaming will remain at the heart of our Xbox offering. \u00a0Game creators around the globe are already hard at work building content for Xbox Series X and our 15 Xbox Game Studios are developing the largest and most creatively diverse lineup of Xbox exclusive games in our history.

For me the final print results, DPI and quality and color accuracy of print, durability of color/print, and capability of printer to print on all printable papers by printer is important(looking to print on many different types of papers preferably).\n\n\\-If it can print border-less, it would be an advantage, as two above mentioned ones are border-less?\n\n\\-What do you suggest me between these two Canon PIXMA-Pro-100 or Canon PIXMA-Pro-10?\n\n\\-Is the print quality is same on both Canon PIXMA-Pro-100 or Canon PIXMA-Pro-10? What about possibility to print on different papers?\n\n\\-Is there a way to prevent the print/color being destroyed if any water accidentally drops/spills on the paper printed by any of the Canon PIXMA-Pro-100 or Canon PIXMA-Pro-10? If I print on quality A4 'laser printer papers', does the color/print is vulnerable to spill of water? Is there any way to prevent this? e.g. color laser photo printers are not vulnerable to spill of water even if the print is done on normal photocopy A4 papers, is there any way to make this happen on the inkjet/dye/pigment based printers? As both Canon PIXMA-Pro-100 and Canon PIXMA-Pro-10 are 'dye' based printers, are they more resilient to accidental spill of water?\n\n\\-If I want to stamp the paper by printer instead of physical stamp, will the color of stamp will be realistic, in case I tune the stamp color that I may design in Photoshop for use as corporate stamp to be printed by printer on high quality documents and photos? I like to replace traditional stamps by a digital stamp that can be printed from Photoshop design of stamp for increasing security of stamp not being stolen physically? Is there any way to make stamp color realistic with any of the above printer? if not, what printer can do this for me?\n\n\\-What else accurate and high quality Photo color printer do you suggesting me please?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTnx and best of luck", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/e4d6ez/looking_for_a_a3_photo_printer_what_about_canon/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i may design", "selectorShort": "design", "MarkedSent": "looking for a a3 photo printer? what about canon pixma-pro-100 or canon pixma-pro-10? which one can print the highest quality photo and high quality color document? what other brands or models do you recommend please? /!/  \n\nhiya,\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n\\-i'm looking for a a3 photo printer? what about canon pixma-pro-100 or canon pixma-pro-10? which one can print the highest quality photo and high quality color document? what other brands or models do you recommend please?\n\n\\-i'm looking to buy a perfect 'photo color printer'. a printer that can accurately print all photos and high quality documents accurately? what about canon pixma-pro-100 or canon pixma-pro-10 that have 4800x2400 dpi or more? what else do you suggesting? for me the final print results, dpi and quality and color accuracy of print, durability of color/print, and capability of printer to print on all printable papers by printer is important(looking to print on many different types of papers preferably).\n\n\\-if it can print border-less, it would be an advantage, as two above mentioned ones are border-less?\n\n\\-what do you suggest me between these two canon pixma-pro-100 or canon pixma-pro-10?\n\n\\-is the print quality is same on both canon pixma-pro-100 or canon pixma-pro-10? what about possibility to print on different papers?\n\n\\-is there a way to prevent the print/color being destroyed if any water accidentally drops/spills on the paper printed by any of the canon pixma-pro-100 or canon pixma-pro-10? if i print on quality a4 'laser printer papers', does the color/print is vulnerable to spill of water? is there any way to prevent this? e.g. color laser photo printers are not vulnerable to spill of water even if the print is done on normal photocopy a4 papers, is there any way to make this happen on the inkjet/dye/pigment based printers? as both canon pixma-pro-100 and canon pixma-pro-10 are 'dye' based printers, are they more resilient to accidental spill of water?\n\n\\-if -----> i !!!  want to stamp the paper by printer instead of physical stamp, will the color of stamp will be realistic, in case -----> i !!!  tune the stamp color that -----> i !!!  -----> may !!!  -----> design !!!  in photoshop for use as corporate stamp to be printed by printer on high quality documents and photos? i like to replace traditional stamps by a digital stamp that can be printed from photoshop design of stamp for increasing security of stamp not being stolen physically? is there any way to make stamp color realistic with any of the above printer? if not, what printer can do this for me?\n\n\\-what else accurate and high quality photo color printer do you suggesting me please?\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntnx and best of luck", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 70960, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "vivienw", "date": "2019-04-08 02:24:21", "content": "Question about doing game/graphic design for free (more details below)? /!/ Going to try to make this as simple as I can!\n\nA family friend's son designed a (potential) mobile game and wants me to design graphics for it, and has promised to pay me a percentage of the shares if the game makes a profit. \n\nIt's basically a ton of game pieces (like icons/logos) that need to be designed, so I only want to do a partial amount of work.
