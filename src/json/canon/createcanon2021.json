I\u2019ve used it in the humidity of Charleston, the salty air of Aruba and Jamaica, the cold winters of Washington and Montana, and the long hours of a professional wedding video. The camera is simply amazing when you just go out and create without overthinking the boundaries of the camera itself. \n\nI\u2019ll start with the \u201cnegatives\u201d because these would be my only two complaints to canon. And these could easily be fixed in a firmware update.\n\nDid it overheat? Once during the wedding but I learned from it. I learned that I don\u2019t need to shoot 4K HQ for a wedding because the files are simply too large for my hard drives. I learned to be more precise in my shots and not over shoot which saves me time in post. It made me a better videographer. This isn\u2019t crippling like people make it out to be.\n\nYes, the file sizes are large. Large enough that I had some serious issues at the start of owning this camera. I had to create a new workflow and now it isn\u2019t an issue. Once I got accustomed to it, life was easier.
