Recently noticed that the button to switch between Video and Photo mode got jammed at the edge of Video mode. At first I was able to switch it around with a lot of nail-force but now it seems completely jammed and I just haven't gotten photos of the last few places I visited because of that. The other day I got it a little wet accidentally in the rain, and all of a sudden it seemed like it was moving freely between modes. But I don't think intentionally making it wet is a good idea to fix it again. Any clues on how to approach fixing this?
