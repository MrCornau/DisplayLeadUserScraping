For the Sony, I'm pretty sure it'd be the Zeiss Loxia 21mm, for the following reasons:\n\n* Compact, lightweight.\n* Nice wide angle, great for landscapes.\n* Impressive f2.8, close focusing distance, beautiful bokeh, so you can get very up close (great for portraits, or macro-type shots)\n* Minimal barrel distortion.\n* Gorgeous starbursts. I know it's a love/hate thing, and I know you can apply them in post, but on the photos I've taken with this lens where they are present, I just love how they look and the character they add.\n* Really great contrast, I just love how the photos look straight out of camera.\n* Only real downside is manual focus: but all the photos I've taken with it, the focus is pretty spot on.\n\nWhy does Canon not make a lens like this? Or maybe I'm missing it. What I want is a lightweight, compact wide-angle prime lens with minimal distortion, great SOOC colors, and can work as well for portraits as landscapes.

My issue lies within the following situation, and please correct me if I'm wrong: \n\nThe 250D/SL3 has the APS-C sensor. I believe that this means the camera is a crop sensor. I looked up the crop factor and it seems to be approximately 1.6. That means that with my prime lens, I will actually be taking 80mm shots, is this correct? I am looking to do portraits and have heard that between 50mm-85mm is the sweet spot for that. \n\nMy other questions, regarding the crop sensor again, would mean that even though I have the 18-55mm it would technically only be 28mm-88mm. I am hoping to also do some travelling and landscape photos. Would the 10-18mm be better in general?
