Using Custom profiles to make your (my) life easier. /!/ Setting up my R6 - Think I've finally found my sweet spot. Just wanted to share what I feel is MY final set-up for my R6 (It's not ideal for everyone I know, so if it's not for you - that's cool). I think quite a few people are changing from older Canon models (5D3,4 etc) and are at first struggling with the camera settings on the R6. I know I was, so I thought sharing what helped me might help someone else. I knew the camera could be great...at times. But sometimes I couldn't stop it from doing things I didn't want it to do, especially when it came to focusing. \"Don't pick that!\" I found myself saying more than once...lol. So, first off, I thought to myself, what do I photograph most of the time. And I broke that down into three categories - 1. Static/posed mages (sometimes with people, sometimes without). 2. \"Capturing a moment\" images - usually involving kids running around, couples kissing, walking, etc. And 3. Moving animals. (Since getting the R6 and the 600MM, I've somehow become a wannabe National Geographic Photographer..lol). So, with those 3 basic image types in mind, this is how I approached my set up (And for the record, as mainly a natural light photographer most of the time I shoot in AV mode - let's not argue the pros/cons here). I created 3 custom profiles using the c1,c2, and c3 on the dial. And now easily switch back and forth between each of the profiles, without ever (or rarely) having to go into the menu system to change anything - This is my first time using the custom settings and so far it's worked great for me. As a side note - make sure you enable the joystick button to move focus points - personally I find it quicker than sliding a finger on the screen and by pressing the joystick in returns focus to centre point) And I use Elec. 1st curtain mainly. And I have my ISO set to the thumb dial.\n\n1. Static/posed Images - To set up my profile, put camera in AV. I put on the fastest lens I have and put the aperture at the lowest value. Personally I think 99% of shots I take are at the lowest value - I'm not buying a 1.2 lens to shoot at f4. lol. This ensures no matter what lens I have attached, the profile will always go the lowest aperture value of that lens. I put the ISO at 100. I changed the AF Operation to ONE SHOT AF and the AF Method to Center Point focus - move the focus via the joystick when required. I moved exposure compensation slightly to the left. Low Speed continuous shooting - with High Speed+ continuous, I found myself taking close to 3 photos each time!  And programmed the AF-ON button to change the AF Operation to Eye Tracking when pressed - This allowed me to be able to eye focus on static portraits when it was required (be sure to have \"people\" as eye type) Keep your finger on the button when pressing the shutter. And it could be said that I could leave the camera in SERVO - put just personally for me, it's comforting for me to hear the \"focus beep\" lol. Hence ONE SHOT AF. - Register these as C1. \n\n2. Moving Images. Same as above for most. But AF Operation changed Eye+Face Tracking (be sure to have \"people\" as eye type), AF Operation Changed to SERVO. High Speed+ Continous shooting. Register to C2.\n\n3. Animals. Same as 2, but eye priority as \"Animal\". Register as C3.\n\n  \nAnd that's it! For me, it's worked great this past week. As mentioned, it's not a one size fits all for sure. Just know the camera is so capable of customization and it's best to use the custom buttons for your most common uses, as opposed to changing them in the menu.

I a young, aspiring filmmaker who also enjoys capturing and editing photos. My first real camera was a SL2, which was later demoted to my secondary camera when I upgrade to the M50. I don't think that gear is everything, but it definitely helps. For Christmas 2019 I asked for the Ivy Rec for a few reasons: it was cheap, looked fun, why not?\n\nSo, what do I think of it so far? I'll be honest, I used it pretty sparingly when I first got it. I had also received some accessories for my M50 so I was spending a lot of time playing around with those. In the last few months I have kept the Ivy Rec in my pocket almost everywhere I have gone, just in case. Even though I have a Samsung S10, which takes great photos, it was nice to have a camera that I wasn't terrified of dropping (I've broken a few phones), and one that I wasn't always looking at the photo after the fact. It's the definition of point and shoot. I heard some had troubles with the app, and initially I did too. Thankfully, Canon released a few software/firmware updates and things seem to work a lot better now. I found it worked smoothly when I manually connected my WiFi to the camera (Samsung multitasking came in handy).\n\nI know you all want to know about one thing: performance. In well lit areas, the photos come out very nicely. Not nice enough to truly impress anyone, but far from bad. I took similar pictures of my dog with both the Ivy Rec and my S10. While the S10 looked sharper, the vibrance of its photos were a bit much, at least for an unedited photo. That's where I think the Ivy Rec stayed true to the Canon name, the colours. They weren't mind-boggingly amazing. Nothing on this camera is. But the colours of the sky were much truer to life. It isn't all peachy though. As with pretty much all cameras, especially at this price range, low light situations usually result in lower quality photos and videos. This is true for the Ivy Rec. It is very true. Without a flash, the Ivy Rec takes photos that are near unusable in poor lighting conditions. While this is definitely a downfall, this camera begs to be taken out on walks or hikes. I have found myself taking it with me even when I'm going to shoot on a much higher quality camera. There's a novelty in looking through a square carabiner clip to frame your shot (I recommend using the app to change the aspect ratio to 1:1, it makes the square cutout make a lot more sense). It brings a childlike joy to go out and snap a bunch of pictures, not knowing how they turned out until later.\n\nThe video is actually pretty rewarding, provided good lighting. Out the box it films in 720p, in 2020 that's just not gonna cut it. In the Canon MiniCam app you can change the quality to 1080p at either 30 or 60 frames. Respectable. I would absolutely love a firmware update to allow for 24 frames as I shoot almost strictly in 24, even if I would be shocked if I used Ivy Rec footage in something serious. The video quality, and audio quality for that matter, truly surprised me with how decent it looked. This may have been because I wasn't expecting anything at all, but regardless, it would be the kind of camera you can take with you on an amusement park ride. Vlogging isn't ideal due to the lack of a viewfinder, but with some practice I'm sure you can figure out the best angle for vlogging if you really wanted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(My) Verdict:\n\nThe Ivy Rec has grown on me over time and has earned its spot in my pocket next to my wallet, ready to go at a moments notice. As long as the lighting is fair, it will perform well enough for what it is, so long as you don't expect DSLR or DSLM quality. If you want a fun, little camera that makes you rethink the process of taking a photo, look into the Ivy Rec.\n\nThanks for reading this review thing, I think I was fair to this camera considering all it has going for it (size, price, purpose).

Therefore it should have no impact on the performance of phase-detection auto-focus, yet it could influence the contrast-detection auto-focus. Therefore my hypothesis is, that by enabling expo. simul. contrast-AF can mess up and sees no contrast in the darker subject when the ISO is kept low. Slightly increasing the ISO will help the contrast-AF algorithm to 'see' contrast in the darker subject again. On the other hand, by disabling exposure simulation, the camera focuses mainly with PDAF (just like the 7D), and focuses just fine.\n\n**Poor implementation?**  \nThough my hypothesis could explain my findings, I still find it a rather poor implementation of exposure simulation, since the PDAF could have easily taken over and locked focus, when the contrast-AF had trouble doing so.

Increasing the ISO allowed me to focus onto the cat, but caused the background to be completely blown out.

I had two canon cameras in the past but they were crop censored and I barely had any lenses for them. This isn\u2019t a Bash one company over another post, just to give my take on Canon\u2019s mirrorless coming from Sony. \n\n1) Canon has made some serious improvements to their software and it\u2019s much easier to use than any Sony camera I\u2019ve ever owned. Just having a touchscreen and being able to select things in a menu that are easy to read and understand. Menus written with the type of grammar typically used in my own dialect made picking up the camera and knowing where all the settings are, a task that lasted about an hour total. I had my a7R for so long and still couldn\u2019t find some of the settings quickly after years of usage. \n\n2) I really love the size of the camera and how it feels in the hand. I know cameras are trending towards smaller form factors but I applaud canon for sticking to what photographers are used to. I have very large hands and it\u2019s nice to know that the cameras not going to slip out while I\u2019m holding it at a strange angle. \n\n3) there\u2019s been a lot of talk about color science over the years. No matter which side of the fence you\u2019re on, I can\u2019t deny what my I can see.  Canon seems to have this figured out.  it was one of the major factors as to why I made the switch. There\u2019s my things a photographer can adjust when you shoot RAW, and there are some things that are challenging to do, based on the system you use. I\u2019ve owned three different Sony cameras and not one of them produced tones, contrast, edge detail, Close to what this canon has produced. (I owned 42 megapixel a7R that had no aa filter with 4 g-master lenses, so it was a sharpness beast.) I have to admit, Canon just understands image processing. I feel like a no other camera manufacturer, save for Fuji, can match what they do, regardless of whether you\u2019re shooting RAW or JPEG. \n\n4) If you ever decide that you want to switch systems Canon\u2019s glass is so excellent and so compatible that it easily the smarter investment. I spent thousands of dollars on G master lenses. When I had to sell them, I lost so much. No matter what system I use I\u2019ll make sure my glass is compatible with the new bodies going forward. \n\n5) Dual pixel auto focus is just as good as Any real time focusing system. I haven\u2019t tested it on fast moving object yet but I\u2019m not really a wildlife shooter nor sport shooter, so my opinion could change based on the scenario but from what I\u2019ve seen so far it\u2019s spot on and really impressive.\n\n6) Lastly, I registered my camera today and posted on my Instagram story my unboxing. I tagged Cannon and to my surprise it they responded to my post. In the three years I\u2019ve been posting Sony photographs, even taking product shots of Sony products, I\u2019ve never once received any attention from their pages.
