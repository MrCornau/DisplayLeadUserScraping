Having exposure compensation, which can be set in manual mode, by holding the Q button down and scrolling the wheel to adjust the exposure accordingly, would also be a useful function to have. My issue is that the camera, so far as I can tell, only allows you to map the Q button to one or the other; if I choose to have exposure compensation with the Q button, in order to adjust my settings I'd have to turn the screen back on, then press the Q button on the touch screen, which isn't a huge imposition, but it is a bit less convenient. Does anyone know if there is a way to map some other button (such as the Av +- button) to do exposure compensation in manual mode, so that I can still use the Q button to quickly alter my settings? I know that the Av+- button is the way you can do exposure compensation in aperture and shutter priority, but unfortunately this doesn't seem to work in manual mode, which is a pity. Unless I've missed something.\n\nIf anyone would be able to weigh on this issue, that would be great.
