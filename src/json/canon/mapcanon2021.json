LOVING it so far--it feels like a huge leap forward, and that's even before I'm able to use it with any of my modern EF lenses to check out the autofocus system (the EF&gt;RF adapter was backordered and hasn't arrived yet)!\n\nBut I have a question about the behavior of the viewfinder and rear screen. I've tinkered with the settings, but I can't seem to get things to behave the way I'd like. Essentially, I want to replicate the various dSLRs I've been using for the past 15 years:\n\n* Rear screen off by default, but turns on if I press a menu or playback button\n* EVF turns on when I put it to my eye (or is on by default)\n* Rear screen shows image review for 2 seconds after shooting, then turns off\n\nIn the default auto-switching mode, the eye sensor causes the rear screen to constantly turn itself on and off when I've got the camera on a strap and it bounces around. Feels like that will run the battery down a lot faster than it should. Eco mode kinda addresses that by quickly dimming the screen, but it also dims when I WANT the screen on, which is super-annoying.\n\nThe best workaround I've found so far is to set the display to the EVF by default, and map a rear button to switch between EVF and screen. That disables the eye sensor and keeps the rear screen off, which is what I want. It's one additional button press to get the menu or playback to appear on the rear screen, which isn't too bad. But it disables automatic image review, since I don't want that to appear in the EVF if I'm still shooting (and it doesn't activate the rear screen when switched over to the EVF).\n\nI can't be the only one coming from a mirrored dSLR and wanting to basically replicate the behavior I'm accustomed to.

Maybe a future firmware update will address?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/lg9e2e/new_r6_user_viewfinder_question/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "new r6 user - viewfinder question! /!/ i recently upgraded from my trusty 7d mark ii to an r6, my first mirrorless dslr (and first full-frame sensor). loving it so far--it feels like a huge leap forward, and that's even before i'm able to use it with any of my modern ef lenses to check out the autofocus system (the ef&gt;rf adapter was backordered and hasn't arrived yet)!\n\nbut i have a question about the behavior of the viewfinder and rear screen. i've tinkered with the settings, but i can't seem to get things to behave the way i'd like. essentially, i want to replicate the various dslrs i've been using for the past 15 years:\n\n* rear screen off by default, but turns on if i press a menu or playback button\n* evf turns on when i put it to my eye (or is on by default)\n* rear screen shows image review for 2 seconds after shooting, then turns off\n\nin the default auto-switching mode, the eye sensor causes the rear screen to constantly turn itself on and off when i've got the camera on a strap and it bounces around. feels like that will run the battery down a lot faster than it should. eco mode kinda addresses that by quickly dimming the screen, but it also dims when i want the screen on, which is super-annoying.\n\nthe best workaround i've found so far is to set the display to the evf by default, and -----> map !!!  a rear button to switch between evf and screen. that disables the eye sensor and keeps the rear screen off, which is what i want. it's one additional button press to get the menu or playback to appear on the rear screen, which isn't too bad. but it disables automatic image review, since i don't want that to appear in the evf if i'm still shooting (and it doesn't activate the rear screen when switched over to the evf).\n\ni can't be the only one coming from a mirrored dslr and wanting to basically replicate the behavior i'm accustomed to. any thoughts or tips? maybe a future firmware update will address?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 39022, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 292761, "autor": "2003aaa", "date": 1610355865000, "content": "Two things I don\u2019t like about the EOS RP /!/ I\u2019ve been carrying it around for a few days, and two things stand out.\n\n1.
