Outside of my holidays I rarely take pictures on trips. The majority of my pictures consist of landscape and city photos, as well as portraits of my wife.\n\nI started with a Canon EOS 400 with a Tamron. Due to bacteria and the fact that I never changed the lens I came to my current Panasonic LX100. I liked the small construction very much. Over the years I notice that the resolution is not enough for me. You don't have any crop possibilities and there is always a lack of zoom. Since I like to create portraits of my wife, I also wish a little more dof. From the lowlight performance I also wish for a little more. A today's Google Pixel creates partly low-noise pictures. In addition, there is now some dust inside and cleaning is not possible.\n\nNow I would like to buy a new camera. I am now looking for a solution with which I hope to make a qualitative jump. Since I do not like to exchange lenses, there should be a very good all-rounder. I don't want to have a compact camera anymore, because you have to throw everything away after a few years.\n\nThe question that I ask myself now is if I would buy an A6400/6500, for example. Would there be a lens to recommend and would the difference to my LX100 be noticeable? At the moment I also have an eye on the A7III with the Tamron 28-70. Of course this solution is much bigger and more expensive, but I hope for a big jump here. But I'm a little afraid of the size, so maybe you won't always take the camera with you. Also I am not always sure when looking at pictures here. There are pictures of people there you can see every skin pore, but also again pictures that look average what my LX100 also performs. Also many night shots are blurred and partly not nice to look at. But here I assume that these were taken out of hand and are not due to the camera. What also strikes me is that you always see a lot of noise in the pictures. I don't have that at the moment.\n\nSummary:\n\nWould an A6400/6500 with only one lens be an improvement on my LX100? Or would the purchase be a waste of money?\n\nDoes it have to be an A7III? \n\nMy last solution would be to put it completely on a mobile phone, e.g. Google Pixel 4. I would go back a few steps, I would miss Zoom etc. but for that I would have a device which I always have with me and no additional costs.\n\nI just don't know if I should just take 3k\u20ac in my hand, if there is an interim solution, or if I should hang up my hobby.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/csxg09/new_purchasing/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "i like to create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "new purchasing /!/ hello, everybody.\n\ni am a hobby photographer and it is important to bring high quality pictures from my holiday home. outside of my holidays i rarely take pictures on trips. the majority of my pictures consist of landscape and city photos, as well as portraits of my wife.\n\ni started with a canon eos 400 with a tamron. due to bacteria and the fact that i never changed the lens i came to my current panasonic lx100. i liked the small construction very much. over the years i notice that the resolution is not enough for me. you don't have any crop possibilities and there is always a lack of zoom. since -----> i !!!  -----> like !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> create !!!  portraits of my wife, -----> i !!!  also wish a little more dof. from the lowlight performance i also wish for a little more. a today's google pixel creates partly low-noise pictures. in addition, there is now some dust inside and cleaning is not possible.\n\nnow i would like to buy a new camera. i am now looking for a solution with which i hope to make a qualitative jump. since i do not like to exchange lenses, there should be a very good all-rounder. i don't want to have a compact camera anymore, because you have to throw everything away after a few years.\n\nthe question that i ask myself now is if i would buy an a6400/6500, for example. would there be a lens to recommend and would the difference to my lx100 be noticeable? at the moment i also have an eye on the a7iii with the tamron 28-70. of course this solution is much bigger and more expensive, but i hope for a big jump here. but i'm a little afraid of the size, so maybe you won't always take the camera with you. also i am not always sure when looking at pictures here. there are pictures of people there you can see every skin pore, but also again pictures that look average what my lx100 also performs. also many night shots are blurred and partly not nice to look at. but here i assume that these were taken out of hand and are not due to the camera. what also strikes me is that you always see a lot of noise in the pictures. i don't have that at the moment.\n\nsummary:\n\nwould an a6400/6500 with only one lens be an improvement on my lx100? or would the purchase be a waste of money?\n\ndoes it have to be an a7iii? \n\nmy last solution would be to put it completely on a mobile phone, e.g. google pixel 4. i would go back a few steps, i would miss zoom etc. but for that i would have a device which i always have with me and no additional costs.\n\ni just don't know if i should just take 3k\u20ac in my hand, if there is an interim solution, or if i should hang up my hobby.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13852, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "jtxhd", "date": "2019-06-04 15:51:43", "content": "Help with resetting the photo folders/directory on my a6000 without deleting my photos! /!/ https://i.imgur.com/DIkVTq8.jpg\n\nSo I\u2019m not sure how to do this, but I know i\u2019m in the right place in Settings.

I'm currently a GH5 user who shoots videos 95%+ time manual focus. I create content shooting a ton of 60 fps footage if that matters.\n\nHowever I would like to do some of my work with shallower DoF than my GH5 with 12-35 2.8 so I'm looking for a tool to do that reliably (Disclaimer: GH5 autofocus is bad). I was considering Canon R and A6000 series but A7 series draw my attention because of IBIS (although I would most likely to be using a stabilizer at all times when using fullframe) and better low light performance.\n\nIf I would buy A7III, or maybe A7SII, which lenses should I get to have the best AF experience for video?\n\nI'm mostly looking to buy 1-3 lenses.

My family was able to recall all sorts of stories about the people in the pictures, tell me in what way we're related, when the pictures were taken approximately. Some of the stories were very impressive, and I would hate for them to be lost. I would like to create some sort of archive for later generations and because my memory will definitely fail me, I have decided to sort all of the pictures with a family member and get all information I can get about each picture.

I find that photography is lacking this aspect which for me seems to be critical.\n\nFor example, with conventional jobs, it's straight-forward. Go to school, work hard, and you get rewarded with good grades and a job offer. Then you're further rewarded with a guaranteed salary, praise for your good work, promotions, etc. You have a manager and a team who will support you (ideally). I mean, this all can vary wildly, but in my experience this was mostly the case. It's like playing an MMORPG in real life -- there are straight-forward quests and a clear progression for you to follow.\n\nThen you have less conventional fields. I was a musician for a while, and that was certainly more difficult, but there was so much positive reinforcement. First of all, your bandmates will tell you when your ideas are actually good, and help keep things going when you feel down. Second, when you play a show and people visibly appreciate your music and tell you how great it was, it feels incredible. Third, putting your work out there yields results. Things like reviews, articles, radio airplay, etc just sort of happened naturally. It's a saturated field, for sure, but not as saturated as photography -- I think it takes more work to produce something that people are willing to take a listen to. There's really not \\*that\\* much original, high quality work in my opinion.\n\nThen you have photography. There's no team or band -- you're on your own. So, when you lack confidence in your ability, no one will support you. You put your work out there, but even a 97-98 pulse on 500px will only get you 5 new followers. The same images will do very little on instagram unless they get featured, which might yield 20 followers. (Just my experience, purely anecdotal.) But, even great images easily disappear into the void unnoticed since the field is so saturated, so let's say only one out of every 4 images gets featured somewhere (unlikely). So, you can create 100 professional quality images and end up with 100 \\* 5 = 500 followers on 500px, and 100 / 4 \\* 20 = 500 followers on instagram.\n\nThat's certainly a start, but there are people with images that are unoriginal and bad to mediocre in quality, and 5 figure followings. Their work will rank higher than yours no matter how good your images are. **And maybe that's fine if you can somehow know that your work is good, social media is perhaps a bad metric for quality, but after a while, how do you know? Maybe it's actually bad and you're just just delusional? Maybe you're just not a real artist? Maybe the reason for your lack of following is that you just suck and no one has the heart to tell you?** That's how I feel when I don't have any validation, at least. I'm sure some of you feel the same.\n\nNow, I don't think I have 100 professional level images yet, I have maybe 10. I consider most of my work utter garbage and have a long way to go. But, to even get to this point it took many years. The amount of work needed to crate one high quality image is super high, and even once you're good it takes time. I remember Thomas Heaton mentioning he gets maybe 1 \"keeper\" per month even while doing it full time. So, at the rate I'm going, I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel here.\n\n(That light being some strong positive response that will encourage you to keep going)\n\nOf course, it's about the journey, and I would find it very hard to not do photography. I really love it. But seeing my work getting nowhere while I had achieved success with much greater ease in other fields is demoralizing and makes me doubt my abilities, which in turn makes me enjoy it less and just wonder if my time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nUltimately I want to add value to the world, not just spend my time doing stuff I enjoy. Otherwise I'd just be playing videogames or hiking all day, but, I find creating something people appreciate to be more fulfilling. A common advice is to take a break from photography and see if inspiration returns. I've done that. The inspiration is there. The self-doubt, however, is stronger.\n\n**How do others deal with it?**\n\nOne idea I've had is forming a \"study group\" with like-minded photographers of a similar level to help each other improve and grow, as Mads Peter Iversen suggested in a recent video. I probably need to make that happen soon. Also, maybe I'm just getting extra sad lately from not being able to get out into the mountains due to the quarantine.

(just my experience, purely anecdotal.) but, even great images easily disappear into the void unnoticed since the field is so saturated, so let's say only one out of every 4 images gets featured somewhere (unlikely). so, you can create 100 professional quality images and end up with 100 \\* 5 = 500 followers on 500px, and 100 / 4 \\* 20 = 500 followers on instagram.\n\nthat's certainly a start, but there are people with images that are unoriginal and bad to mediocre in quality, and 5 figure followings. their work will rank higher than yours no matter how good your images are. **and maybe that's fine if you can somehow know that your work is good, social media is perhaps a bad metric for quality, but after a while, how do you know? maybe it's actually bad and you're just just delusional? maybe you're just not a real artist? maybe the reason for your lack of following is that you just suck and no one has the heart to tell you?** that's how i feel when i don't have any validation, at least. i'm sure some of you feel the same.\n\nnow, i don't think i have 100 professional level images yet, i have maybe 10. i consider most of my work utter garbage and have a long way to go. but, to even get to this point it took many years. the amount of work needed to crate one high quality image is super high, and even once you're good it takes time. i remember thomas heaton mentioning he gets maybe 1 \"keeper\" per month even while doing it full time. so, at the rate i'm going, i just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel here.\n\n(that light being some strong positive response that will encourage you to keep going)\n\nof course, it's about the journey, and i would find it very hard to not do photography. i really love it. but seeing my work getting nowhere while i had achieved success with much greater ease in other fields is demoralizing and makes me doubt my abilities, which in turn makes me enjoy it less and just wonder if my time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nultimately i want to add value to the world, not just spend my time doing stuff i enjoy. otherwise -----> i !!! 'd just be playing videogames or hiking all day, but, -----> i !!!  -----> find !!!  -----> creating !!!  something people appreciate to be more fulfilling. a common advice is to take a break from photography and see if inspiration returns. i've done that. the inspiration is there. the self-doubt, however, is stronger.\n\n**how do others deal with it?**\n\none idea i've had is forming a \"study group\" with like-minded photographers of a similar level to help each other improve and grow, as mads peter iversen suggested in a recent video. i probably need to make that happen soon. also, maybe i'm just getting extra sad lately from not being able to get out into the mountains due to the quarantine. this is the longest i haven't hiked in 4 years.\n\nanyway, thanks for reading! i would love to hear your thoughts if you can relate.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 78737, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "arshrhere13", "date": "2020-04-29 00:26:49", "content": "Best Custom Photo Book Website? /!/ I'm creating a photo series of all my friends in Quarantine, and I want to make like a physical coffee table book with all of the photos.

Under these conditions \u2013 with contrast and brightness at a maximum \u2013 there is no room for a full range of tones and the scene tends to look a bit flat.

This may end up an exquisite failure, but I think it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nSo what I am hoping for in addition to the research I\u2019m trying to do for this model, is to get a little help from owners of this or similar scanners: PrimeFilm XA, PrimeFilm XE, Reflecta RPS 10M, Reflecta ProScan 10T, etc. Particularly those of you that have reached a point where you\u2019re happy with the results you\u2019re getting.\n\nHopefully this won\u2019t be too big of an ask. I want to collect some data from more than just my specific scanner, because what works best for my scanner may not work best for another. So, with that in mind, here\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping to find:\n\n* Which model of scanner you have\n* Which software you\u2019re using for the actual scan process\n* What changes you\u2019ve made from the default settings on that software, if any\n* An unmodified image of a 5000 dpi scan:\n* * Preferably black &amp; white film, ideally FP4 or HP5 but any ISO 400 or slower is fine\n* * Throw away frame is perfect as long as it\u2019s in sharp focus and well exposed, I wouldn\u2019t ask for anything special, I just need something for comparison purposes. I would not use the image in the wiki or for any other purpose.\n* * No changes made after the scan process.

So I prepared two examples that show different subjects that where scratched and dirty. But in addition I like to explain what the steps are to achieve this results so that some aspects could be applied to DSLR scanning or other techniques.\n\nTo see the differences better I recommend to see the image at full resolution. You can also download example 2 images at full resolution to be able to flick through the images for better comparison: [Download Example 2 Images (Full resolution)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i6xi6jbhl56kfi6/AACCG3PQtXJQf7uhWTbmpdMFa?dl=0) I also added the IR scan, flat field and dark frame in that shared folder to show how they look like.\n\nNow the technical part. Wall of text incoming :)\n\n# Scanner &amp; Scanning Software\n\nBoth Examples are scanned with a dedicated film scanner, the Minolta Multi Pro. For the scanning software I used Vuescan using the 64bit raw tiff capability that extracts the IR scan into the alpha channel of the scan. I think Silverfast is also capable of doing this for certain models but not my Minolta.\n\nBut in the past I also used an Epson 4990 which also worked pretty good. It only had aligning issues at times from the image to the IR scan, because it scans them in separate passes and the film might bulge in between due to the heat of the lamp.\n\n# Flat Field Correction\n\nOften this is done from scanner software directly and called \"calibrate scanner\" to even out the ccd sensor response and of the light source. But I had issues with the internal scanner software calibration from Vuescan that caused colored 1 pixel lines and other unusual shadows/color shades.  So I decided that this must be done manually on the raw scan to fix the issues.\n\nI used a technique that astro photographers are using to correct their photos that are often plagued with noise and other optical shades. You can read up details and the math behind it at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-field_correction). \n\nHere is a excerpt from my scanning working doc:\n\n\\------------------\n\n**! Important** \n\nSetup your crop area for your all your scans and leave it unchanged! Otherwise the calibration will not work as it should be.\n\n**Dark Frame (Fixed Pattern Noise = FPN)**\n\nUsed to correct the dark current noise and uneven response of the CCD pixels to remove stripes in the scans.\n\n* Scan frame with holder opening closed with same exposure and samples as the image that is about to be  scanned\n* Check the dark frame for light leaks. It should be flat without any brighter parts.\n* Resize image to a 1 pixel strip (along line sensor axis)  to get a footprint of the line sensor response. The resize to 1 pixel will interpolated (bicubic) so that the average is used later on.\n* Place the dark frame on the base image and resize it back to the size of the base image.\n* Subtract dark frame from base image\n\n**Flat Field (FF)**\n\nUsed to eliminate uneven illumination of the lamp and to correct dirt on the mirrors and sensor.\n\n* Set the exposure as high as possible without any clipping!\n* Dark frame is subtracted from the flat field\n* That flat-field 'image' is normalized by dividing the entire image by the brightest pixels of the FF image.\n* Divide base image with the flat field image.\n* Note: the IR channel must be flatfielded as well\n\n# IR Clean\n\nThe cleaning of the scan is done with the help of the IR scan (infra red) of the film. Infrared is capable to show defects as dark spots that help to mask them properly.\n\nHere is a excerpt from my scanning working doc:\n\n\\------------------ \n\n* Reduce visible image parts from the Infrared image by dividing it with the Red channel of the image. This must be done because the infrared sensor sees some of the visible color spectrum.\n* Further optimize IR image by reducing sensor noise with a noise reduction filter to be able to create better cleaning mask.\n* Create a mask from the IR image that will be used to clean the final image. \n* Clean up the final image with the mask using the content aware fill from Photoshop\n\n# Photoshop Action:\n\nIn the end I created several Photoshop actions that handles all the cleanup and correction process with one click.

i write some of this a bit satirically, however i am seriously looking for someone who can shed a light on why people, photographers in our case, are never satisfied?\n\nchange for something better os progress\u2026but change just for something different seems insane!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 97629, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "jonneymendoza", "date": "2021-01-29 15:15:50", "content": "Creating a photo book /!/ Hi all.\n\ni have a couple of projects i want to finish off really where the finishing touches are producing a proffesional photo book that upon request, could be printed and made by a third party and me shipping it to potential buyers.\n\nI know that loxy colour provides some of this and they do create some really nice quality prints, however, i have to go and create the photo album and its layout using there god awful desktop app.\n\nSeeing how all my photos gets organised and edited on lightroom, i am wondering if i can use lightrooms \"Book\" mode i believe it has to create the photo book(with some text as well, not just images) and generate a pdf that i can then upload to loxley or similar to then go ahead and create that book for me based on what paper quality and cover i want.\n\nOr is there a company like loxley that has a lightroom plugini so it can all be intergrated and \"ordered\" directly from Lightroom?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/l7v01m/creating_a_photo_book/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "-----> creating !!!  a photo book /!/ hi all.\n\ni have a couple of projects i want to finish off really where the finishing touches are producing a proffesional photo book that upon request, could be printed and made by a third party and me shipping it to potential buyers.\n\ni know that loxy colour provides some of this and they do create some really nice quality prints, however, i have to go and create the photo album and its layout using there god awful desktop app.\n\nseeing how all my photos gets organised and edited on lightroom, i am wondering if i can use lightrooms \"book\" mode i believe it has to create the photo book(with some text as well, not just images) and generate a pdf that i can then upload to loxley or similar to then go ahead and create that book for me based on what paper quality and cover i want.\n\nor is there a company like loxley that has a lightroom plugini so it can all be intergrated and \"ordered\" directly from lightroom?", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 98077, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "walgreensfan", "date": "2021-05-01 01:03:37", "content": "Film camera or Polaroid?

Thank you for being a part of our community. Thank you for caring about Flickr. Thank you for supporting Flickr. Thank you for being a Flickr Pro.\n\nTwo years ago, Flickr was losing tens of millions of dollars a year. Our company, SmugMug, stepped in to rescue it from being shut down and to save tens of billions of your precious photos from being erased.\n\nWhy? We\u2019ve spent 17 years lovingly building our company into a thriving, family-owned and -operated business that cares deeply about photographers. SmugMug has always been the place for photographers to showcase their photography, and we\u2019ve long admired how Flickr has been the community where they connect with each other. We couldn\u2019t stand by and watch Flickr vanish.\n\nSo we took a big risk, stepped in, and saved Flickr. Together, we created the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community: a place where photographers can stand out and fit in.\n\nAnd yet, Flickr\u2014the world\u2019s most-beloved, money-losing business\u2014still needs your help.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work improving Flickr. We hired an excellent, large staff of Support Heroes who now deliver support with an average customer satisfaction rating of above 90%. We got rid of Yahoo\u2019s login. We moved the platform and every photo to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the industry leader in cloud computing, and modernized its technology along the way. As a result, pages are already 20% faster and photos load 30% more quickly. Platform outages, including Pandas, are way down. Flickr continues to get faster and more stable, and important new features are being built once again.\n\nOur work is never done, but we\u2019ve made tremendous progress.\n\nFlickr still needs your help. It\u2019s still losing money. You, and hundreds of thousands of loyal Flickr members stepped up and joined Flickr Pro, for which we are eternally grateful. It\u2019s losing a lot less money than it was. But it\u2019s not yet making enough.\n\nWe need more Flickr Pro members if we want to keep the Flickr dream alive, and we need your help to share the story of Flickr.\n\nWe didn\u2019t buy Flickr because we thought it was a cash cow. Unlike platforms like Facebook, we also didn\u2019t buy it to invade your privacy and sell your data. We bought it because we love photographers, we love photography, and we believe Flickr deserves not only to live on but thrive. We think the world agrees; and we think the Flickr community does, too. But we cannot continue to operate it at a loss as we\u2019ve been doing.\n\nFlickr is the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community. It\u2019s the world\u2019s best way to find great photography and connect with amazing photographers. Flickr hosts some of the world\u2019s most iconic, most priceless photos, freely available to the entire world. This community is home to more than 100 million accounts and tens of billions of photos. It serves billions of photos every single day. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a priceless treasure for the whole world. And it costs money to operate. Lots of money.\n\nAs you know, Flickr is the best value in photo sharing anywhere in the world. Flickr Pro members get ad-free browsing for themselves and their visitors, advanced stats, unlimited full-quality storage for all their photos, plus premium features and access to the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community.\n\nPlease, help us spread the word. Help us make Flickr thrive. Help us ensure Flickr has a bright future. Every Flickr Pro subscription goes directly to keeping Flickr alive and creating great new experiences for photographers like you. We are building lots of great things for the Flickr community, but we need your help. We can do this together.\n\nWe\u2019re launching our end-of-year Pro subscription campaign on Thursday, December 26, but I want to give you a coupon code to share with friends, family, or anyone who shares your love of photography and community so they can enjoy the same 25% discount before the campaign starts.\n\nWe\u2019ve gone to great lengths to optimize Flickr for cost savings wherever possible, but the increasing cost of operating this enormous community and continuing to invest in its future will require a small price increase early in the new year, so this is truly the very best time to help everyone upgrade to a Pro membership.\n\nIf you value Flickr finally being independent, built for photographers and by photographers, we need your help.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nDon MacAskill\nCo-Founder, CEO &amp; Chief Geek\nSmugMug + Flickr\n\nPlease share coupon code 25in2019 or link below to give the gift of 25% off Flickr Pro now.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=25in2019", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ed32hx/the_state_of_flickr_email_from_ceo/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "we created", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "the state of flickr (email from ceo) /!/ dear flickr pros,\nfirst, and above all else: thank you. thank you for being a part of our community. thank you for caring about flickr. thank you for supporting flickr. thank you for being a flickr pro.\n\ntwo years ago, flickr was losing tens of millions of dollars a year. our company, smugmug, stepped in to rescue it from being shut down and to save tens of billions of your precious photos from being erased.\n\nwhy?

Then you should know your value chain /!/ Hello everyone!\n\nI am writing this because I see a lot of people asking the same questions over and over and thought it would be nice to give you all the tools to answer your own questions. Or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. Why should you listen to me? With the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; I am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. I am not claiming I am the smartest person in the world, but I do feel confident in what I am saying here.\n\nThe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. In fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions I have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nThe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. A value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nFor example: If I am running a lemonade stand, I buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. If that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know I am creating ($200-$100)/(1+3+1) = $20/hour. We also know how much value each step creates. If I wanted to hire a buddy to set up the stand, then we know that unless they are priced at below $20 its not worth it. If I want to make my little brother run the stand, then unless they are priced at below $60, its not worth it.\n\nWhy does this apply to photography? Because like any business making the \"lemonade\" is just one step in the process. You also need to do: business functions, like billing, marketing functions like advertising, process functions like editing, and other small things like transportation. People forget these, or under estimate them, and it will ruin your profit margin.\n\nLets look at some example of how you can apply this to your every day.\n\nExample 1: a friend is asking you to shoot their product/event/person/dog, how much should your friends and family discount be?\n\nMany people do not realize this, but there is actually a business case to give a friends and family discount. When you look at your value chain, look at all the steps you do not need to do because they are a friend. You don't need to advertise, because they came to you. You don't need to network because you were already friends. Your communication time is less because you can get some of the details worked out when you normally hang out with them. Lets say you normally charge $900 for a specific job, and you add up all of these savings and it is $300. If you are struggling to get clients, then you can offer them the job for $600, which saves them $300 and gets you profit you would not have gotten otherwise. If you are packed full time with clients, you can offer them the job for $750, saving them $150, and earning you $150 more than you would normally earn since you saved all these costs.\n\nIn either case having your value chain, and knowing what your needs are (more clients, more money, etc.) lets you make a financially sound decision when offering a discount. More importantly it is a win-win situation as both of you are better off had you not made the deal.\n\nExample 2: You hear about this new app that will help you get clients, should you join?\n\nSimilar to the lemonade stand example, except it is slightly reversed, instead of hiring someone and setting the financial boundaries, you are being hired and the boundaries are set for you. Once again your value chain can come to your rescue and help you decide. Now I am going to assume anyone considering this type of gig is new to the business, as they always are in my experience. What you first need to do is quickly think about any red flags from your value chain perspective. In previous jobs, how much time was spent getting the client vs shooting/editing? If networking is 70% of your time, then when you outsource that task you are outsourcing 70% of the profits.\n\nAs a new shooter you may think that 70% is an absurd number but a quick google search of how long pros spend actually shooting will validate it.\n\nhttps://www.thephoblographer.com/2015/07/30/how-professional-photographers-actually-spend-their-time/\n\nFrom this link you can see that most photographers spend ~15% of their time shooting an editing, with one spending as little as 6% of their time on it. So if the only thing you want to do is shoot/edit, then you will only see 15% of the profits. How does that app sound now? For most photographers (let alone new ones) you can expect a small restaurant to pay &lt;$400 for an average food shoot. This means if you work for an app on this gig, you can expect to get paid &lt;$60 for your work. Dividing that by the time to travel to the site, get set up, shoot the food, tear down, travel home, and edit for your hourly wage and you are probably netting &lt; $15/hour. Maybe that's worth it to you, maybe its not, but you at least have the information to make the decision yourself.\n\nSo how do you create a value chain?\n\nI know it might be tempting to steal the % off the link above, and while that is a good starting point it wont work. Your work is different and takes different efforts. Your clients are different and require more/less work. Your location is different and needs more/less time to get around. Most importantly you business model makes a huge difference, are you trying to sell prints? Are you trying to sell to individuals? Are you trying to get repeat customers? Make your own value chain.\n\nFor a small new photography business what you should probably do is\n\n1. List out every step you need to take for a profit. Include things like advertising, networking, doing your finances every month, harassing clients for payments.\n2. Record the time it will take at every step. If you don\u2019t know, ask some pros for advice, if everyone hates you, take your best estimate and adjust, but use this as a last resort.\n3. Come up with a reasonable hourly rate for each step. Think of it this way, dont ask what you want to be paid for each step, ask what you would be willing to pay per hour to have someone else do it. The reason is because this sets up your mind to think of these as the minimum costs, which is what you want.  \n4. Multiple your hours by hourly rate, and total up\n\nExample of a value chain:\n\nTask 1: recruiting clients. 20 hours per week. $10/hour. $200 total.  \nTask 2: shooting/editing. 3 jobs per week, 3 hours per job. $20/hour. $180 total.  \nTask 3: transportation. 3 jobs per week, 1 hour per job. $10/hour. $30 total.  \nTask 4: business operations (e.g. billing). 10 hours per week. $10/hour. $100 total.  \n\nWhat does this tell me?\n\n1. I will be expecting to work 42 hours a week\n2. I will be expecting to have $510 in \u201ccosts\u201d per week\n3. For 3 jobs I need them to pay at least $510/3 = $170 a job\n4. If I outsource client acquisition I lose $200/$510 = 40% of the potential profit\n5. If I find a client that does not require transportation (e.g. in my building) I can offer them a $30/$510 = 6% discount\n\n*Note that these are made up numbers with no real relation to the real world*\n\nKeep in mind that these are the breakeven points of everything. So I would not, for example, price a client at $170 because that would be \u201ccost plus pricing\u201d which is generally considered bad. Pricing is a whole different demon to tackle and would have to be its own post.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more from people much smarter than me, I would suggest starting with this HBS article. Do keep in mind, however, that Porter's more refined and detailed value chain analysis is meant for companies, with different departments. For 1-5 people working a super small business, its not really all that necessary to get that detailed, but it definitely wont hurt!\n\nhttps://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-value-chain-analysis", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/q2mqhp/want_to_earn_money_from_your_photography_then_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i am creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "want to earn money from your photography? then you should know your value chain /!/ hello everyone!\n\ni am writing this because i see a lot of people asking the same questions over and over and thought it would be nice to give you all the tools to answer your own questions. or at least the 2% of you who search before asking questions. why should you listen to me? with the important caveat that you should never blindly trust anyone and should fact check everything; i am a business consultant; people literally pay me to tell them how to run their businesses. i am not claiming i am the smartest person in the world, but i do feel confident in what i am saying here.\n\nthe point of this post is not to answer your questions but to give a wonderful tool that you can use to solve your own problems. in fact, this will solve nearly all of the business questions i have seen on here in the last few months.\n\nthe tool is taking a day to analyze what is the \u201cvalue chain\u201d is in your business. a value chain is just a fancy term to describe the steps you take to create a product of value, including the value/cost at every step.\n\nfor example: if i am running a lemonade stand, i buy $100 of product, and sell $200 of product. if that takes 1 hour to set up the physical stand, 3 hours of sales, and 1 hour of begging my mom to come pick me up then we know -----> i !!!  -----> am !!!  -----> creating !!!  ($200-$100)/(1+3+1) = $20/hour. we also know how much value each step creates. if i wanted to hire a buddy to set up the stand, then we know that unless they are priced at below $20 its not worth it. if i want to make my little brother run the stand, then unless they are priced at below $60, its not worth it.\n\nwhy does this apply to photography? because like any business making the \"lemonade\" is just one step in the process. you also need to do: business functions, like billing, marketing functions like advertising, process functions like editing, and other small things like transportation. people forget these, or under estimate them, and it will ruin your profit margin.\n\nlets look at some example of how you can apply this to your every day.\n\nexample 1: a friend is asking you to shoot their product/event/person/dog, how much should your friends and family discount be?\n\nmany people do not realize this, but there is actually a business case to give a friends and family discount. when you look at your value chain, look at all the steps you do not need to do because they are a friend. you don't need to advertise, because they came to you. you don't need to network because you were already friends. your communication time is less because you can get some of the details worked out when you normally hang out with them. lets say you normally charge $900 for a specific job, and you add up all of these savings and it is $300. if you are struggling to get clients, then you can offer them the job for $600, which saves them $300 and gets you profit you would not have gotten otherwise. if you are packed full time with clients, you can offer them the job for $750, saving them $150, and earning you $150 more than you would normally earn since you saved all these costs.\n\nin either case having your value chain, and knowing what your needs are (more clients, more money, etc.) lets you make a financially sound decision when offering a discount. more importantly it is a win-win situation as both of you are better off had you not made the deal.\n\nexample 2: you hear about this new app that will help you get clients, should you join?\n\nsimilar to the lemonade stand example, except it is slightly reversed, instead of hiring someone and setting the financial boundaries, you are being hired and the boundaries are set for you. once again your value chain can come to your rescue and help you decide. now i am going to assume anyone considering this type of gig is new to the business, as they always are in my experience. what you first need to do is quickly think about any red flags from your value chain perspective. in previous jobs, how much time was spent getting the client vs shooting/editing?

I\u2019m a graphic designer and all though most of the photographs go into a folder titled \u201cweb scrap book/photojournal\u201d that I look over from time to time, I do browse through the folder if I know I might have something perfect for a design project. Metadata is often overlooked. If I look at the photograph and it has no metadata to tell me who took it, it was uploaded to a platform that allows me to download it freely, and I can\u2019t find what I need through a reverse image search. I act as if the photographer intended for their art to be shared for free. I would like to save information about the poster but it isn\u2019t something I can do in two clicks. I would like to give the original artist recognition in the metadata of any file I create regardless of licensing too. It\u2019s really simple to add metadata in photoshop and other editing software. This is something that we should all be focusing on. A good picture will spread across the internet rather quickly. Although the quality might be less than due to compression, so long as I don\u2019t have to enlarge the photograph or use it for print (in some cases) the photo is usually good. We all have differing opinions when it comes to license. Ethical designers look for this information because we don\u2019t appreciate theft of intellectual property either. Watermarks are a good, Reddit automatically puts a bar at the bottom of the photo with the name of the user who posted it. I don\u2019t like to be dependent on watermarks because they rub clients the wrong way and can be disruptive to composition. I know pro photographers are aware of how much their content can be worth so they work with stock companies. I have a few pictures posted on line that were taken on my cell phone that aren\u2019t up to pro quality but are still good enough to use depending on how. Sometimes the random cell phone shot is the missing piece to a composition. My whole point, ya never know, I\u2019m not educated about copyright laws but I feel like a court would respect metadata as proof that an artist owns content. I would be enraged to find out that a large corporation was using my content without cutting me out a piece of the pie. Seeing my content used by Non profits, small business, and In portfolio work wouldn\u2019t bug me at all. If I donate work to non-profit organizations I can claim it on my taxes, that\u2019s a win win. If I include a line in metadata indicating who I\u2019m willing to donate too then they don\u2019t even have to ask for it to be considered donated. The most important inclusion is contact information though. If I see nothing but \u201cthis photo is the intellectual property of John Doe, he can\u2019t be reached at jodo88@domain.net\u201d I could just email and ask. I know that cameras can add metadata when the photo is shot. I\u2019m sure some if not all pro cameras allow photographers to set defaults for metadata.

My main purpose is documenting my hikes, which I used to do with my phone, but wanted an upgrade in image quality.\n\nWith the camera, my process for dealing with the pictures has changed quite a bit, and the effort has increased significantly. I also feel like my methods aren't exactly efficient, but I'm not sure what exactly I could improve. So I'd like to collect your preferred processes and learn from them.\n\nFor the record, these are my old and current processes, respectively:\n\n**Old Process (Phone)**\n\n1. Let MS Onedrive back up the pictures from my phone.\n\n2. Create an album for that day/hike/event from the camera reel.\n\n3. Delete the bad or unsuitable pictures from the album.\n\n4. Download the album to my computer and back it up locally.\n\n**New Process**\n\n1. Insert SD Card into card reader on PC.\n\n2. Look through pictures, deleting bad ones and rating really good ones as 4/5 stars within Windows Explorer. See step 4 for relevance of the latter.\n\n3. Be annoyed with Windows 10 because Windows 7 was better and more convenient at literally everything. Be salty about lost functionality like jumping to the file from the open photo, or being able to have the preview and details pane open simultaneously, as well as being able to rate the picture from the open photo without having to switch back to the folder and looking for the current image by name to be able to rate it.\n\n4. Sort by name, manually select the RAW files corresponding to the 4-5 star rated JPEGs, and send them over to a \"Source/RAW\" folder on the hard drive (No use in keeping the mediocre RAWs).\n\n5. Send the remaining JPEGs to the Source folder.\n\n6. At this point, I would use rawtherapee to create optimal PNGs from the RAW files, but I'm still learning how to make those not look shit, so instead at this point, I edit the JPEGs that could be good but need some adjustments.\n\n7. Create an Album folder for that Day/Hike/Event and copy (not move) all the pictures over.\n\n8. Delete the ones I don't want in the Album.\n\n9. Upload the album folder to Onedrive (web, not the windows folder. I hate how that one works) for backup / sharing among family and friends.\n\n10. Optionally copy individual pictures to different folders comprising various topical favorite images like \"of my wife\", \"of my pets\", etc.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nI'm currently wasting up to around 110% extra hard drive space by copying images into various themed folders. This is not an issue yet, but might become costly in the future.\n\nThe reason I do this is that I find it the easiest method to find the pictures later, it's the most convenient form of organization to my brain, shortcuts and tags wouldn't work for uploading, and I don't trust tags.\n\nWhen I say I don't trust tags, I mean I don't want to go through hours of effort tagging images by content only to find in ten years that my new operating system doesn't know what to do with the tags I created in Windows 10, for example. Themed folders full of copied files seem much more reliable.\n\nThe downside of copy pasting is that if I alter an image later on, be it in name or the image itself, I have to apply those changes everywhere else the image is saved as well.\n\nI think the biggest issue currently is how long steps 1-6 are taking me, and I'm almost sure there has to be a better way, perhaps 3rd party software assisted. \n\nI'd also like to waste less hard drive space, and have the images thematically filed but connected.\n\nI've considered having Onedrive (web) as my canonical filing space and using their tags and albums instead of copying files, as that resolves all my issues except the futureproofing aspect (I'd hate to have to reorganize tens of thousands of pictures the day I stop using Onedrive.)\n\n**What do you do yourself?

/!/ i'm relatively new to photography and quite recently bought my first real camera (a fuji x-t30). my main purpose is documenting my hikes, which i used to do with my phone, but wanted an upgrade in image quality.\n\nwith the camera, my process for dealing with the pictures has changed quite a bit, and the effort has increased significantly. i also feel like my methods aren't exactly efficient, but i'm not sure what exactly i could improve. so i'd like to collect your preferred processes and learn from them.\n\nfor the record, these are my old and current processes, respectively:\n\n**old process (phone)**\n\n1. let ms onedrive back up the pictures from my phone.\n\n2. create an album for that day/hike/event from the camera reel.\n\n3. delete the bad or unsuitable pictures from the album.\n\n4. download the album to my computer and back it up locally.\n\n**new process**\n\n1. insert sd card into card reader on pc.\n\n2. look through pictures, deleting bad ones and rating really good ones as 4/5 stars within windows explorer. see step 4 for relevance of the latter.\n\n3. be annoyed with windows 10 because windows 7 was better and more convenient at literally everything. be salty about lost functionality like jumping to the file from the open photo, or being able to have the preview and details pane open simultaneously, as well as being able to rate the picture from the open photo without having to switch back to the folder and looking for the current image by name to be able to rate it.\n\n4. sort by name, manually select the raw files corresponding to the 4-5 star rated jpegs, and send them over to a \"source/raw\" folder on the hard drive (no use in keeping the mediocre raws).\n\n5. send the remaining jpegs to the source folder.\n\n6. at this point, i would use rawtherapee to create optimal pngs from the raw files, but i'm still learning how to make those not look shit, so instead at this point, i edit the jpegs that could be good but need some adjustments.\n\n7. create an album folder for that day/hike/event and copy (not move) all the pictures over.\n\n8. delete the ones i don't want in the album.\n\n9. upload the album folder to onedrive (web, not the windows folder. i hate how that one works) for backup / sharing among family and friends.\n\n10. optionally copy individual pictures to different folders comprising various topical favorite images like \"of my wife\", \"of my pets\", etc.\n\n**considerations**\n\ni'm currently wasting up to around 110% extra hard drive space by copying images into various themed folders. this is not an issue yet, but might become costly in the future.\n\nthe reason i do this is that i find it the easiest method to find the pictures later, it's the most convenient form of organization to my brain, shortcuts and tags wouldn't work for uploading, and i don't trust tags.\n\nwhen -----> i !!!  say -----> i !!!  don't trust tags, -----> i !!!  mean -----> i !!!  don't want to go through hours of effort tagging images by content only to find in ten years that my new operating system doesn't know what to do with the tags -----> i !!!  -----> created !!!  in windows 10, for example. themed folders full of copied files seem much more reliable.\n\nthe downside of copy pasting is that if i alter an image later on, be it in name or the image itself, i have to apply those changes everywhere else the image is saved as well.\n\ni think the biggest issue currently is how long steps 1-6 are taking me, and i'm almost sure there has to be a better way, perhaps 3rd party software assisted. \n\ni'd also like to waste less hard drive space, and have the images thematically filed but connected.\n\ni've considered having onedrive (web) as my canonical filing space and using their tags and albums instead of copying files, as that resolves all my issues except the futureproofing aspect (i'd hate to have to reorganize tens of thousands of pictures the day i stop using onedrive.)\n\n**what do you do yourself?

I got it for $1300 at the time and it came with a 16-50 f2.8 lens. My main passion was shooting sports (ultimate frisbee) and wildlife. I also ended up buying a g master 70-200 f2.8 for this purpose. I created lots of awesome photos, but at some point something happened to my system where parts of my picture seem blurry and I more than likely would need to take it in to get fixed. My main issue is there is very little support for a-mounts with Sony, and will be next to no support going forward so instead of spending a good amount of money to fix my system, I have decided to invest in a system with a bright future.\n\nI was constantly switching between Sony mirrorless and Nikon in general. The appeal of Nikons mirrorless wasn\u2019t really there for me considering how new they were and didn\u2019t look to great to me spec wise. As far was Sony goes I was debating either a a7iii or an a9 if I decided to save up for the more expensive body. After going to a local camera store, I got to hold a lot of these cameras to at least get somewhat of a feel for them. I was blown away by how good the Nikon mirrorless felt in my hand. It really felt like a smaller more compact DSLR and had as good of a grip of one. I tried holding some canons for good measure and my god the EOS R just feels like shit in my hands. Like a legit metal brick. Blech. Sony still felt nice, but I would\u2019ve liked if they put the same rubber grip that Nikon does for its mirrorless.\n\nAfter this I felt more confident in my decision making as how a camera feels in hand does play a large part in what you choose. So now I\u2019m debating either the Z6 which has more FPS, or the Z7 which has less FPS but more pixels, more autofocus points, and just more upgraded features for a bigger price. Only other factor which would make me not go Nikon is how Sony feels much lighter in hands, and already has a good array of lenses for what I need whereas I\u2019d need to wait for Nikon to come out with wildlife/ sports lenses and not use an adapter for their F mounts.\n\n\nDo any of you have any thoughts or opinions on what you would choose?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/c4izom/i_have_finally_decided_on_getting_a_nikon_but/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "i created", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "i have finally decided on getting a nikon, but need help /!/ tl;dr trying to decide between a z6 or a z7 for sports/wildlife. \n\nso awhile back i had purchased a sony a77ii which was a fantastic camera. i got it for $1300 at the time and it came with a 16-50 f2.8 lens. my main passion was shooting sports (ultimate frisbee) and wildlife. i also ended up buying a g master 70-200 f2.8 for this purpose. -----> i !!!  -----> created !!!  lots of awesome photos, but at some point something happened to my system where parts of my picture seem blurry and -----> i !!!  more than likely would need to take it in to get fixed. my main issue is there is very little support for a-mounts with sony, and will be next to no support going forward so instead of spending a good amount of money to fix my system, i have decided to invest in a system with a bright future.\n\ni was constantly switching between sony mirrorless and nikon in general. the appeal of nikons mirrorless wasn\u2019t really there for me considering how new they were and didn\u2019t look to great to me spec wise. as far was sony goes i was debating either a a7iii or an a9 if i decided to save up for the more expensive body. after going to a local camera store, i got to hold a lot of these cameras to at least get somewhat of a feel for them. i was blown away by how good the nikon mirrorless felt in my hand. it really felt like a smaller more compact dslr and had as good of a grip of one. i tried holding some canons for good measure and my god the eos r just feels like shit in my hands. like a legit metal brick. blech. sony still felt nice, but i would\u2019ve liked if they put the same rubber grip that nikon does for its mirrorless.\n\nafter this i felt more confident in my decision making as how a camera feels in hand does play a large part in what you choose. so now i\u2019m debating either the z6 which has more fps, or the z7 which has less fps but more pixels, more autofocus points, and just more upgraded features for a bigger price. only other factor which would make me not go nikon is how sony feels much lighter in hands, and already has a good array of lenses for what i need whereas i\u2019d need to wait for nikon to come out with wildlife/ sports lenses and not use an adapter for their f mounts.\n\n\ndo any of you have any thoughts or opinions on what you would choose?", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 78538, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Icebearltu", "date": "2019-07-10 19:30:43", "content": "SELLING SERVICES&gt;&gt;&gt; Creating Clean Websites &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; /!/ If you\u2019re looking for a fully functional WordPress website that meets the needs of the ever-changing world-wide-web, then look no further!\n\nWhy you should work with us\n\nWe Highly Focus On:\n\n\u00b7 Efficiency\n\n\u00b7 Accuracy\n\n\u00b7 On Time Delivery\n\n\u00b7 Customer Satisfaction\n\n\u00b7 Quality Product Delivery\n\nPrivate message me for more info or is interested to my services", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/cbl94s/selling_services_creating_clean_websites/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Cameras", "result": true, "Selector": "creating", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "selling services&gt;&gt;&gt; -----> creating !!!  clean websites &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; /!/ if you\u2019re looking for a fully functional wordpress website that meets the needs of the ever-changing world-wide-web, then look no further!\n\nwhy you should work with us\n\nwe highly focus on:\n\n\u00b7 efficiency\n\n\u00b7 accuracy\n\n\u00b7 on time delivery\n\n\u00b7 customer satisfaction\n\n\u00b7 quality product delivery\n\nprivate message me for more info or is interested to my services", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 80756, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "crepuscopoli", "date": "2019-08-12 20:29:05", "content": "Im not sure if i need 4k!

Also many of my favorite camera Youtubers use the EOS R, like Peter Mckinnon and Potato Jet, among many others. And they make great looking content.\n\nFor me I create sketch comedy almost exclusively. So, quality might not seem that important, however, I think that high quality cinematic video makes comedy funnier (like Key and Peele and The Hangover, etc.).\n\nI should also mention that I'm shooting on pretty inexpensive glass. That may limit how much the EOS R will matter.\n\nFinally, I have about $1300 to spend right now, today on a camera.

If you have already seen it, then apologies. Hope mod will approve this post.\n_______\nI have tried capture pro, Dxo photolab, on1 photo raw for one month each for 3 months. \n\nWith each software, I have retouched about 2000 raw images from Fuji xt20, dng from my smartphone and raw files from Panasonic DMZ Bridge. I have created Color and BW images, panorama if available, and HDR.\n\nOn1 raw had hopes. But it's so slow to load images. Dxo photolab was not bad. Specially it had awesome user interface and noise reduction in phenomenal. But doesn't support Fuji or Pentax (not that I have).\nCapture was was in another league. The speed is unbeaten. Excellent for  productivity. \nI almost baught it. \n\nThen I have heard of Silkypix which I had installed but never used it. \n\nSo, just before I was about to take my wallet out for Capture One I gave silkypix a go. \n\nSo, I have edited about another 2000 images with files from Fuji RAF, Panasonic raw and dng from my smartphone.\nOne word. Color. It doesn't possess the speed of capture one or dxo. Local adjustment was not bad. \n\nBut, to recover highlights, NR it is as good as others if not better. Sharpness is not bad either. On top, \nSilkypix could produce literally exact same colors as jpegs with better details. And just because of that, I am sold. Plus it has different stacking options. The sliders are not to aggressive. I find it enough to professional work. If I really need to push the boundaries and need some more specific work then I use Affinity Photo.\n\nTheir manual is very well explained. Everything is pretty straightforward. Less is more\n\n So, I like it. \n I repeat, Capture is in another league when it comes to speed and retouching options. Even the free version is pretty awesome. But silkypix developer is fantastic for it's color rendition. It made me feel same way I felt with Fuji ergonomics and canon colors. It supports every camera brands and lens. They even make softwares for nikon, Fuji, Olympic and Panasonic and more.

It's important that our battalion takes photographs of what we do to create a public image. Unfortunately, since many of us are busy engineering students, it is rare that we come across someone that is a good photographer, or someone who has even taken basic classes. Every semester our photographer position changes meaning that oftentimes, it's difficult to even prepare for the role.\n\nWe are currently searching for a new camera as our old one is starting to get outdated. The camera is an older Nikon D3100 and the age is starting to show.

So the budget is a little flexible here.\n\nI'm asking for your help in suggestions of cameras that would fit our needs. What we're looking for is a camera with some of the following traits, listed in order of priority:\n\n1. **Ease of use**. We're looking for something that's easier to \"just pick up and shoot\" with. We realize that no camera makes you a perfect photographer, but whatever you guys think is on the more user-friendly side!\n\n2. **Still photography**. Many of the pictures we take are at events where the subjects can hold a pose, so high quality photos of non-moving subjects would be great.\n\n3. **Low light**. Oftentimes I've found myself in a situation where I struggle to get enough exposure without getting super blurry shots. I'm not quite sure if this is a trait that differs between cameras, but this would be a nice quality to have in our camera.\n\n4. **Moving photography**. I know this one contradicts #2 a little bit but I thought I'd throw it out there. We also like to take pictures of our midshipmen in action, such as PT, close order drill, field exercises, etc. Again, not a must-have but a nice addition.\n\n* We're also looking for some **lenses**! One or two is really all we can afford.\n\nI totally understand that good photography is the product of a *good photographer, not a good camera*. Unfortunately, we rarely have the time to give our midshipmen classes on photography, so we're kind of forced to rely on a good camera. \n\nAny suggestion helps my search!

Things I dislike about it are the fact that there's no communication to the camera (so no EXIF data), no autofocus (given the focal length, this is probably not an issue anyways), but I'm much more worried about lateral chromatic aberration, which is according to lens tip the higher of the three and also the 5 apperture blades in this lens produced rather bad looking sun stars which I'm not a fan of.

I found myself shooting a lot more consumer film during lockdown in an effort to spend a bit less, and was surprised about the capabilities of these budget stocks but confused about the differences. I've read many opinions about the pros and cons of each, but a lot of that information seemed to be presented without any controlled variables. I decided to create a more apples-to-apples comparison to determine (1) any characteristics specific to each stock at different exposures (2) which I preferred for my shooting style. However, I am not a professional photographer or a professional scientist, so these results may not be perfectly foolproof, but I'll do my best to outline any outside forces that may have affect results as we go.\n\nTo conduct this experiment, I loaded a fresh roll of each film into my three Beseler Topcon Super D bodies, and shot every image with the exact same lens, the 58mm f1.4, which I swapped between bodies as we went. All three of the camera bodies are functional and reliable, but I did not get them CLA'd or service each shutter to make sure the speeds were all accurate beyond what I could hear. All three rolls were home-processed in the same tank at the same time with an Arista EDU C41 Kit, the chemicals less than a month old and used on three rolls previously. I will detail my DSLR scanning method and digital workflow in a comment below, in summary I made every attempt to keep my corrections minimal and consistent. These images could easily look more polished with further editing.\n\n**Sample 1.1**\n\n[Kodak Colorplus: 1\\/125 f\\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/7g5xpjyk3ai61.jpg?width=8576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c54c25776051bffe89d190d60381fd3db14137a)\n\n[Kodak Gold: 1\\/125 f\\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/706ttmmp3ai61.jpg?width=8510&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8347ec7ca64800712d9dd35da10717943bd28f7e)\n\n[Fuji C200: 1\\/125, f\\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/zpnmu8eq3ai61.jpg?width=8521&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=044f4c61479c9bf3271ebe55c3b1709da58423f5)\n\n**Sample 1.2**\n\n[Colorplus: 1\\/125, f\\/5.6](https://preview.redd.it/ttwe5d524ai61.jpg?width=8688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef6537adc1bdef6d714cc8604aa10c17a308aa51)\n\n*Processing img 9vw7rc334ai61...*\n\n*Processing img dnqt8rw34ai61...*\n\nOverall the Fuji is much cooler than either Kodak films. In the brighter exposure the elevated shadows becomes severely tainted with the blue cast, but looks acceptable and realistic in the darker exposure (especially considering any potential flare from the window). The Colorplus may have slightly less contrast than the Gold, but they are very close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sample 2**\n\n*Processing img 26iox2s35ai61...*\n\n*Processing img wgkm1mt45ai61...*\n\n[Fuji C200, 1\\/60, f2\\/8](https://preview.redd.it/qso2bmg15ai61.jpg?width=5792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3bd2ec1d32991867d95cafe6458e6b8f80ac843)\n\nThese images feature extreme contrast.

My name is Simon Duvenage, and I am absolutely CRAZY about photography! Currently photography is only a hobby, but I hope one day I will be able to do it as a full-time or part-time job. I have been shooting on a Nikon Coolpix P500 bridge camera for the past couple of years, so I have been saving up to buy my first DSLR because I know that will be quite a big step up from my current setup, and I have no family or friends that have a DSLR that I could borrow. So anyways, a couple of weeks ago, as part of my birthday present my parents decided to help me buy a second hand Canon 800D (T7i for those in the US). So, unfortunately, it turns out it was a scam and the seller disappeared with all my money and never sent me my camera. So now I'm left with a burning passion for photography, and almost no money to finance it.

Felt inspired after just having spent a week in Lofoten. Still have to process lots of images but I did a lot of seascape shots so I figured I'd write up a little guide for Reddit on how to shoot seascapes.\n\n[Header](https://imgur.com/KzQsEwa)\n\nPhotographing the sea and the waves can be both challenging and fun. People often ask me what are \u2018the right settings\u2019 to shoot moving water so I decided to write a little guide on it. There are many options depending on what look you\u2019re going for. By using some examples of my own I\u2019ll explain how I shoot my seascapes.\n\nI usually define 3 options: Shooting the sea normally with a very fast shutter speed (not going to discuss it in this article as it\u2019s just pressing the shutter and not doing much else), shooting the sea with a bit of a slower shutter speed of around 0.5 - 2 seconds, and shooting the sea with a very long exposure to get that super silky smooth water.\n\n**Look &amp; Feel**\n\nNow I like to create some \u2018life\u2019 into my images. I like them dynamic so I often go with the shutter speed of around 1-2 seconds. Why? Because I still get that \u2018painting\u2019 look I love myself, but I still get the movement of the water. The flow that creates the dynamics in an image is very important. It can also be used for compositions. I don\u2019t like very short shutter speeds (except for rare occasions when the sea is very dramatic). Simply because the sea is often quite messy and with very short shutter speed it\u2019s hard to create that painty look I like. This is of course different for everyone, just stating my own style here. I sometimes love extremely long exposures too (30 seconds and up) to create that very smooth surface of water. When you\u2019re shooting with some objects in the foreground (like rocks for example) you can create that \u2018misty\u2019 look. \n\n[Rough sea at Tellera Italy with a 1.3 second exposure to capture the dynamics of the sea.](https://imgur.com/H3dN3t8)\n\n**Settings**\n\nAs mentioned above, for flowing waves and water I like to use a shutter speed of around 0.5-2 seconds depending on how fast the water is moving. I use Aperture priority with a closed down aperture of around f/14. I want a rather closed down aperture because I want a big focus plane. I want things in the foreground and background to be both in focus. I also used a closed down aperture because I want to create that longer shutter speed. Use the lowest ISO available on your camera. If you have bright light during the day you\u2019ll not be able to get a shutter speed of 0.5-2 seconds with just closing the aperture. You\u2019ll need some filters. When the weather gets dark and moody, you may just be able to shoot without a filter because there is less light. When you want a really long exposure during the day, you\u2019ll always need a ND (Neutral Density) filter.\n\n[4 minutes exposure during sunset with a 10 stop ND filter.](https://imgur.com/3Ia7wMH)\n\n\n**Filters**\n\nThere are a wide variety of filters available. To slow down the shutter speed you will have to use ND filters. During daytime I mostly use a 4 or 6 stop to slow down the shutter speed just enough to get that silky look. If you want to use a very long shutter speed, you\u2019ll need a 10 stop filter. The stops define how much light an ND filter will let through. The less light, the longer your shutter speed. Think of it as sunglasses with different strength. You can also use ND graduate filters. These only darken the top of the frame (the sky) so that you can balance out your exposure. The most commonly used ND graduate filter is the 3 stops (often called 0.9 grad) I often use an ND graduate filter together with a full ND filter (4-6 stops, or 10 for very long exposures). Another filters that is very useful for shooting water and the sea is the CPL filter. With the CPL filter you can control the reflections and glare on the water. Sometimes you get those nasty highlights on the water that you want to get rid of. That\u2019s where the CPL comes in. By turning it you can control the amount of reflection on the water.\n\n[Very long exposure (3 minutes) of a seascape in the Netherlands. Leading lines point straight to the middle of the wind direction.](https://imgur.com/LfkzTqg)\n\n[The same scene with a different white balance, toning and settings. Exposure time is only 1 second in this shot to still get those \u2018painty\u2019 waves but the image retains its dynamics and drama. I like both versions even though they are completely different. ](https://imgur.com/u2Y4XJl)\n\n\n\n**Timing**\n\nIf you\u2019re all set up with the right settings, it\u2019s time to shoot! When want to shoot moving waves timing is crucial. Waves come in and pull back, and hitting the shutter button at the right time is essential. Using a remote for this is recommended, as you don\u2019t want to be touching your camera when shooting longer exposures as your shot might get blurry from you touching the camera. I like to control timing myself, but another option is to shoot in burst/continuous mode on your camera. You can just keep shooting all the time and hope you get a nice wave in your shot. Downside of this is that you will get lots of files to go through later and also the timing is not super precise. \n\nNow let me explain you how I shoot waves action. I pick a composition and setup my camera settings. Depending on the scenery I wait for the right moment and press the shutter. The right moment is often when the water or sea pulls BACK. Not when it\u2019s incoming. When it pulls back you get that white foam pulling back into the sea creating beautiful leading lines in your image. When you have rocks in the foreground and you want water splashing over them, shoot when the water is incoming. But the trick is often to wait until the water pulls back and then press the shutter button. I keep doing this until I see an image on my display that I like. Then I move on to another composition. I try different shutter speeds from 0.5 - 2 seconds depending how rough the water is to see what looks best. Just experiment.\n\n[A wave pulling back during a 1.6 second exposure creating that pullback into the sea and the swirl around the piece of ice.](https://imgur.com/8j0SCyu)\n\n**Compositions**\n\n*some tips on compositions with water:*\n\n* Use flowing water as a leading line through the middle or corners. \n* Put your camera very low to the sea to get close up to the action. But be very careful for rogue waves that might hit your camera. Salt water onto your camera often means death.\n* When using very long exposures, use objects in the foreground to create depth in your shot\n* When you found your composition, try all kinds of shutter speeds. very short, 0.5-2 seconds, and 30 seconds. See what looks best.\n* Try to use objects like rocks in the foreground to use for splashing water, or flowing water around.\n* You can use waves on its own to create a photo out of completely nothing. Sometimes a single wave on it\u2019s own can look amazing, without anything else. Just keep shooting to try and catch that perfect wave.\nA wave pulling back in combination with swirling plants create a nice swirling leading line into the image. \n\n[A wave pulling back in combination with swirling plants create a nice swirling leading line into the image.

I can spend hours shooting the same location by just trying to get that perfect wave in my shot. Make sure you wear boots and waterproof pants if you\u2019re going to stand in the waves. Be careful on rough seas and beaches that are known for rogue waves. Also, be very careful that waves are not hitting your camera. Salt water is NOT good! There are cheap rain covers available for cameras that you can use to project your camera. I have seen many cameras die in the sea (and I have had one death myself).

/!/ This is always a topic of conversation that comes up between myself and other photographers, but with the rise of Instagram travel photography, I feel like this issue has definitely moved into a broader mainstream question. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, it's always been an issue with me while traveling, as I struggle with the guilt of taking photos that seem shallow and that romanticize/exoticize other people and ways of life, even if that's not my intention. I won't name names, but I also see more and more photographers on Instagram (a lot of them with hundreds of thousands of followers) traveling to impoverished  countries, and taking photos with no real purpose other than to post to instagram. For instance, a close up portrait of an old man, or photos of random people working on the streets. They claim they are 'documenting', however the photos have no cohesion and tell no real story.

What are the best Settings for Sunset Photography? What are Tips for Sunset Photography? In this Sunset Photography Tutorial I am going to give you my top 5 Tips for Sunset Photography!\n\n**1. Underexpose**\n\nShooting your Sunset Photo slightly Underexposed is probably the most important tip for Sunset Photography. Slightly Underexposing brings out more detail as well as color in the sky. Also do not forget, when shooting underexposed you can always increase the exposure in the post editing!\n\n**2.  Find the** **foreground** **first**\n\nYou do not want to be shooting the Sun as a direct Bulls eye! Find an Object that you can put in the foreground to create extra depth in your photograph. This is probably the most essential tip for Sunset Photography Composition\n\n**3. The Right Composition** \n\nDepending on how beautiful the sky is you have to decide how much of your composition should be the sky and how much should be the foreground. One basic rule is if the sky looks beautiful, have the upper two thirds of your composition as your sky, if the sky is boring, compose the shot so only the upper third makes up your sky.\n\n**4. Stay longer**\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential tips! After around 25 Minutes the Sunset actually starts to be even more beautiful most of the times! You do not want to miss this, so stay patient and even though the Sun perhaps has already crossed the Horizon Line you might still have the Opportunity for a great Photograph\n\n**5. Create silhouettes in the foreground.** \n\nFind an Object that has a lot of detail and that is recognizable. Then Underexpose so that the sky is properly exposed, but the foreground is underexposed. This will create an interesting looking Silhouette effect for your Photograph!\n\nI hope these 5 Tips are helping you for your Sunset Photography. I use these 5 tips and techniques for pretty much every single one of my Sunset shooting days! Though do not forget the most important Tip for Photography is to simply shoot a lot, so go out and shoot!\n\n***If you are interested in more Sunset Photography Tips, check out this Video below!***\n\n[Sunset Photography - How to shoot Sunsets (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGF3YAFAFE)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/8yk3y3/the_sunset_photography_shooting_guide/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "the sunset photography shooting guide! /!/ # 5 sunset photography tips\n\nhave you ever wondered how to get that perfect sunset shot? what are the best settings for sunset photography? what are tips for sunset photography? in this sunset photography tutorial i am going to give you my top 5 tips for sunset photography!\n\n**1. underexpose**\n\nshooting your sunset photo slightly underexposed is probably the most important tip for sunset photography. slightly underexposing brings out more detail as well as color in the sky. also do not forget, when shooting underexposed you can always increase the exposure in the post editing!\n\n**2.  find the** **foreground** **first**\n\nyou do not want to be shooting the sun as a direct bulls eye! find an object that you can put in the foreground to create extra depth in your photograph. this is probably the most essential tip for sunset photography composition\n\n**3. the right composition** \n\ndepending on how beautiful the sky is you have to decide how much of your composition should be the sky and how much should be the foreground. one basic rule is if the sky looks beautiful, have the upper two thirds of your composition as your sky, if the sky is boring, compose the shot so only the upper third makes up your sky.\n\n**4. stay longer**\n\nthis is probably one of the most essential tips! after around 25 minutes the sunset actually starts to be even more beautiful most of the times! you do not want to miss this, so stay patient and even though the sun perhaps has already crossed the horizon line you might still have the opportunity for a great photograph\n\n**5. -----> create !!!  silhouettes in the foreground.** \n\nfind an object that has a lot of detail and that is recognizable. then underexpose so that the sky is properly exposed, but the foreground is underexposed. this will create an interesting looking silhouette effect for your photograph!\n\ni hope these 5 tips are helping you for your sunset photography. i use these 5 tips and techniques for pretty much every single one of my sunset shooting days! though do not forget the most important tip for photography is to simply shoot a lot, so go out and shoot!\n\n***if you are interested in more sunset photography tips, check out this video below!***\n\n[sunset photography - how to shoot sunsets (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqgf3yafafe)", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30000, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Brunhilda100", "date": "2018-07-11 08:35:17", "content": "How can I create a slide show with the file name showing, without having to write a caption? /!/ I need to present about 2000 pictures 30 minutes after I take them.

The scene was beautiful and begging to be photographed. I pulled out my camera and tripod, but was devastated when I realized I'd left all my filters at home. It was way too bright to shoot a long exposure without an ND, so I went home with a couple nice shots that didn't really show the water's movement.\n\nAbout a year from then, I found a blog post about technique where you substitute multiple stacked images for a single long exposure. [Here's the actual post I am referencing.](https://patdavid.net/2013/09/faking-nd-filter-for-long-exposure.html) The technique was super helpful, and I have used it many times since, however I hadn't shot 40 photographs from the same angle so I was out of luck.

Im talking to the millennial natural light only professional \u201cinstagram photographers\u201d here. /!/ On this fine Christmas as I finally feel free from being asked by fellow college students: \u201cHey man what camera should I get for christmas? My budget is...\u201d I would like to take the time to address all of my contemporaries.\n\nLEARN THE BASICS: Get a low cost camera and a prime lens and use it for a YEAR (I know its crazy, recommending to do something consistent to college students). If your first camera is a Sony A73 you will be a shitty photographer and will be down a few grand wondering why photography is not making you happy. Canon 5d classic + 50mm 1.8 would be a good start. You don\u2019t need all this new electronic jazz, start simple. The 5d classic is a legendary camera and can be acquired for less than $400. \n\nPeople compare cameras so often and spend much of their time trying to make a point of which camera is better and why. But photographers from the 30s like Ansel Adams used analog and took better pictures than 90% of the people arguing about which camera is best. Learn the history of photograph and understand how it has grown. Grasp the concept that people used to have to do things manually.\n\nFujifilm, Canon, Sony, Nikon, Leica, etc. all have a camera that has near superior function and use. Each brand is capable of taking a professional picture but this generation spends more time trying to figure out which camera is best out of the box with no skill and what other photographers think on youtube rather than simply picking up a camera and learning the basics of photography and lighting.\n\nSTOP FOCUSING ON FILTERS: \nLearn how to properly light a subject and stop telling yourself that your a natural light photographer. Cause really your about to drop way too much money on a camera you don\u2019t know how to use and not have any lighting equipment! Photography is the capturing of light! Lighting is important! \n\nOnce you learn how to properly use lighting. Try not to butcher it to make the picture look trendy. One way to check that you don\u2019t do this while editing is by using a nifty little thing called a Histogram! You can check your Blacks, shadows, mid-tones, highlights, and whites all in one place!  \n\nTRIPOD TRIPOD TRIPOD:\nHave you noticed that almost no college student uses a tripod and most professional photographers do? Believe it or not. You can take pictures for 1/125-30 seconds without them turning out blurry! Without a tripod you will not have access to &gt;1/125 shutter speed without the picture being blurry. Get a tripod\n\nNot all pictures have to be shared. And you don\u2019t need affirmation to enjoy photography. Create a portfolio for yourself that focuses completely on how to properly photograph a subject or landscape. Keeping in mind composition, lighting, and depth of field. This will help you from feeling the need to over edit a picture!\n\nPhotography is amazing and there is so much more than instagram affirmation and getting a following because of a trendy picture you took. Please take the time to learn! We have a endless source of teaching with the internet. And maybe one day you will be able to take better pictures than photographers from the 30s using analog :)\n\nLast note: Manual modes... check it out.

After the very first post in 2016, I\u2019ve got a lot of suggestions from redditors and decided to complete another list [104 Photo Editing Tools You Should Know About](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/50613q/104_photo_editing_tools_you_should_know_about/).\n\nThen, Michael Zhang, Petapixel\u2019s Editor, asked me to repost this list on Petapixel. The article got 5,419 shares and tons of comments with a new portion of great tools for photo editing. The next list came with [148 photo editing tools](https://petapixel.com/2016/11/01/148-photo-editing-tools-apps/) Then, ten months after, I\u2019ve published a new list [186 photo editing tools and apps. The biggest list ever existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/72sg6a/186_photo_editing_tools_and_apps_the_biggest_list/).\n\nToday I\u2019m no longer with Photolemur (I\u2019ve left Photolemur a week ago). But I decided to continue doing this research. And the next steps will be putting all this software to the website with filters and user rating option. Actually, I\u2019ve already bought the domain :) [photo-index.com](http://www.photo-index.com)\n\nIf someone of you, redditors wants to help me with building the website - just send me a message.\n\n**What has changed in the new list:**\n\nSome of the apps had gone away from the market (you\u2019ll find them in the list). Also, during my new research, I\u2019ve found that there is almost 100 photo editing mobile apps on the market (in the previous list there were only 31 mobile apps). And I decided to create the separate list of photo editing mobile apps. It will be live very soon! So, there is no mobile apps section in this list. I\u2019ve got a lot of comments about including some kind of recommendations to the list.

Using Custom profiles to make your (my) life easier. /!/ Setting up my R6 - Think I've finally found my sweet spot. Just wanted to share what I feel is MY final set-up for my R6 (It's not ideal for everyone I know, so if it's not for you - that's cool). I think quite a few people are changing from older Canon models (5D3,4 etc) and are at first struggling with the camera settings on the R6. I know I was, so I thought sharing what helped me might help someone else. I knew the camera could be great...at times. But sometimes I couldn't stop it from doing things I didn't want it to do, especially when it came to focusing. \"Don't pick that!\" I found myself saying more than once...lol. So, first off, I thought to myself, what do I photograph most of the time. And I broke that down into three categories - 1. Static/posed mages (sometimes with people, sometimes without). 2. \"Capturing a moment\" images - usually involving kids running around, couples kissing, walking, etc. And 3. Moving animals. (Since getting the R6 and the 600MM, I've somehow become a wannabe National Geographic Photographer..lol). So, with those 3 basic image types in mind, this is how I approached my set up (And for the record, as mainly a natural light photographer most of the time I shoot in AV mode - let's not argue the pros/cons here). I created 3 custom profiles using the c1,c2, and c3 on the dial. And now easily switch back and forth between each of the profiles, without ever (or rarely) having to go into the menu system to change anything - This is my first time using the custom settings and so far it's worked great for me. As a side note - make sure you enable the joystick button to move focus points - personally I find it quicker than sliding a finger on the screen and by pressing the joystick in returns focus to centre point) And I use Elec. 1st curtain mainly. And I have my ISO set to the thumb dial.\n\n1. Static/posed Images - To set up my profile, put camera in AV. I put on the fastest lens I have and put the aperture at the lowest value. Personally I think 99% of shots I take are at the lowest value - I'm not buying a 1.2 lens to shoot at f4. lol. This ensures no matter what lens I have attached, the profile will always go the lowest aperture value of that lens. I put the ISO at 100. I changed the AF Operation to ONE SHOT AF and the AF Method to Center Point focus - move the focus via the joystick when required. I moved exposure compensation slightly to the left. Low Speed continuous shooting - with High Speed+ continuous, I found myself taking close to 3 photos each time!  And programmed the AF-ON button to change the AF Operation to Eye Tracking when pressed - This allowed me to be able to eye focus on static portraits when it was required (be sure to have \"people\" as eye type) Keep your finger on the button when pressing the shutter. And it could be said that I could leave the camera in SERVO - put just personally for me, it's comforting for me to hear the \"focus beep\" lol. Hence ONE SHOT AF. - Register these as C1. \n\n2. Moving Images. Same as above for most. But AF Operation changed Eye+Face Tracking (be sure to have \"people\" as eye type), AF Operation Changed to SERVO. High Speed+ Continous shooting. Register to C2.\n\n3. Animals. Same as 2, but eye priority as \"Animal\". Register as C3.\n\n  \nAnd that's it! For me, it's worked great this past week.

(since getting the r6 and the 600mm, i've somehow become a wannabe national geographic photographer..lol). so, with those 3 basic image types in mind, this is how i approached my set up (and for the record, as mainly a natural light photographer most of the time i shoot in av mode - let's not argue the pros/cons here). -----> i !!!  -----> created !!!  3 custom profiles using the c1,c2, and c3 on the dial. and now easily switch back and forth between each of the profiles, without ever (or rarely) having to go into the menu system to change anything - this is my first time using the custom settings and so far it's worked great for me. as a side note - make sure you enable the joystick button to move focus points - personally i find it quicker than sliding a finger on the screen and by pressing the joystick in returns focus to centre point) and i use elec. 1st curtain mainly. and i have my iso set to the thumb dial.\n\n1. static/posed images - to set up my profile, put camera in av. i put on the fastest lens i have and put the aperture at the lowest value. personally i think 99% of shots i take are at the lowest value - i'm not buying a 1.2 lens to shoot at f4. lol. this ensures no matter what lens i have attached, the profile will always go the lowest aperture value of that lens. i put the iso at 100. i changed the af operation to one shot af and the af method to center point focus - move the focus via the joystick when required. i moved exposure compensation slightly to the left. low speed continuous shooting - with high speed+ continuous, i found myself taking close to 3 photos each time!  and programmed the af-on button to change the af operation to eye tracking when pressed - this allowed me to be able to eye focus on static portraits when it was required (be sure to have \"people\" as eye type) keep your finger on the button when pressing the shutter. and it could be said that i could leave the camera in servo - put just personally for me, it's comforting for me to hear the \"focus beep\" lol. hence one shot af. - register these as c1. \n\n2. moving images. same as above for most. but af operation changed eye+face tracking (be sure to have \"people\" as eye type), af operation changed to servo. high speed+ continous shooting. register to c2.\n\n3. animals. same as 2, but eye priority as \"animal\". register as c3.\n\n  \nand that's it! for me, it's worked great this past week. as mentioned, it's not a one size fits all for sure. just know the camera is so capable of customization and it's best to use the custom buttons for your most common uses, as opposed to changing them in the menu. it's made it much easier for me.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 45408, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "traderjay_toronto", "date": "2020-12-28 16:03:57", "content": "Reddit post image size limit /!/ I am relatively new to reddit and am wondering if there is a image size limit for posts?

Now, i'm going to preface this question by saying i have seen  others mentioning it before but haven't come to a conclusion on how to  fix it. It's the old importing/no previews issue. I'm no lightroom whiz  but i'm hoping some of you are when it comes to the technicalites. I'll  include a screenshot over on IMGUR and a link exactly what it is as well  as a video.\n\nIt's happened before and then the issue just seemed to go away on its own.\n\nSpecs:  i5 8600k stock OC/GTX 1080/16gb 2400mhz - it's a good computer and  doubt it would be the problem. I've only see this happen on my SD card  which connects through a CF/SD card reader through USB 3.1\n\nI'm using Lightroom version: 5.5 \\[968504\\]\n\nAnother  thing to note is that before i went out, i imported my photos this  morning so i know it worked then. I shut down my PC, came home and tried  to import the photos from today and this happens \\[see video\\]. Any idea  why this might happen? I'd love to know since this has been an extreme  hassle for a while and extends the time i need to bring a client their  photos.

I remember that was a very exciting period,  with many thoughts whether they will like them, if I'm good enough to do this, somehow I wanted so much to be inside, to learn and why not to get something out of this.  The answer came faster then I thought and it was a success, I was finally in YEY! I started uploading photos, doing all the keywords manually (I later found the keyword suggestion tool), titles, descriptions etc.. I remember it took me 9 hours for my first 70 photos ( English was my first stone to carry in this process). I had in total around 100 photos and I had big dreams about this, I started to read about the website, if they had a forum, if I can interact with other users; some of my questions remained to this day unanswered but baby steps, right? \n\n The website shutterstockjourney.com and my first sold picture \n\n Time passed and nothing happened, I continued to take photos, to go out when I had the chance to but somehow I had a bitter taste about this dream, I couldn't find the way to interact with other contributors (not yet), and all the learning process from the pro's resumed to the YouTube creators.
