Alas, it doesn't. We then proceeded to try and set up a shared folder on the network to which newly scanned documents would be created - the documents however are \"locked\", as in, *not inheriting the permissions to which the shared folder is set* (giving access to \"everyone\").\n\n&gt; Looking around the web we found the following idea : \n\nCreating an \"icacls\" batch file which would be run with task scheduler on a daily basis. This however still leaves us with the option of being annoying to the Main PC to which the scanner is connected to, as it loads up a \"scanning document\" loading bar every time someone scans something.\n\n&gt; We looked around for more options and found other possible solutions :\n\n* 1) **USB Switch Box** (in case we decide to only use this scanner between 2 PC's) - since the LiDE 220 does not have its own power supply, will it work if it is plugged into a Switch Box? Does anyone have any experience with such boxes and do they really work as intended with scanners?\n* 2) **Wireless USB sharing station** - will this somehow enable the scanner to be seen on the network since it will be shared over the USB station which would then be directly connected to the local Router which has internet access?\n* 3) **[Network Twain engine](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nttwain/files/)** - an open source online file, but we do not know whether or not this works?\n* 4) **USB Hub with LAN port** - same as with the Wireless sharing station, will this work somehow?\n* 5) **[SCANWORKS Cloud scan](http://www.scanworkssoftware.com/cloudscan.aspx)** - a tool which supposedly makes the printer available over browser, is this legit, or some kind of malware or virus?\n\nAny advice, help or comment is welcome and appreciated as we desperately need help in making this scanner somehow useful to at least 2 PC's at the same time without having to move it around. **Thank you very much!**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/81sbc1/canoscan_lide_220_scanning_issues/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "canon", "result": true, "Selector": "[idea, creating]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "CanoScan LiDE 220 scanning issues /!/ Greetings,\n\nWe purchased a LiDE 220 and were told that the IJ Scan Network tool would find the scanner on other PC's on the same network.
