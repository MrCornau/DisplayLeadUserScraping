Most of the time at the long end of barrel, that's where I generally prefer to shoot, the AF will either keep hunting forever (15-20 sec). If I set the focus limiter, it doesn't make any significant difference. \nBut more importantly, there are numerous times when the AF simply doesn't work. It's like the AF motor doesn't budge and then out of nowhere it'll eventually focus after maybe 10s or 2min. \n\nI have tried in excellent light conditions. Minimum as well as maximum aperture. AF single point/shoot as well as Services. Tried at different Metering methods (although I use manual exposure pretty much all the time). Also tried different focus points too and manually clicking on the focus point in the screen as well. \nCamera is fairly new and has latest Canon Firmware. The Tamron is having 5x s/n so it should ideally ship with updated firmware from Tamron for EoS R. \n\nMy few questions are:\n-are there EoS R system users out there having same issues ? How bad is it ? \n-I need to check with Tamron ASC to see if they can replace my unit or else issue a refund (very challenging if you're in India). \n-does the usb dock offer any help ?\n-I don't think the autofocus is usable at all unless I pre-focus close enough to the subject. When you do that, it acquires a pretty solid AF and is fast. And that seems the only way to use AF on this lens so far. \n-Is Tamron liable to issue refund/fix ?
