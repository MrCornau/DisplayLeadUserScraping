I've been reading a lot of tutorials on the internet and the conclusion I got was: set the aperture to the max possible, do the math to get the correct shutter speed (500 / FL) and use an High ISO. I have:\n\nCanon EOS 700D\n\nCanon EF-S 18-55mm 3.5-5.6f\n\nFirst of all, with this setup, will I be able to get decent photos from the space? Or it's just not the right tools to do this kind of shot?\n\n[This is how my photos look so far.](https://imgur.com/a/Zup8Zs5)\n\nAs you can see, there is a orange/red-ish tone in all of them, and I can't be sure of what is causing that. My bet is the street light closer to me that has that tone, but it's considerably far from the camera (25-30 meters) and it's in the opposite direction of my shot, so no \"direct\" light is going into the camera. But could this be it? What do you guys think? And how can I improve my shots?\n\nAnother thing, on all the tutorials I've read they always state that I should use a high ISO, but if I do that, the image gets too bright. The brightest image I have in the album was with ISO 3200, but it gets too bright and too much grain. What should I do to compensate this?\n\nAppreciate any tips!",

I wrote some arcticles about music in my social page (and then turned out they are good), and than wrote to one journal about hip-hop and started working in it. I visited some concerts as a press. And once i went for a 7 days music event. I wanted to make some content for my journal, so i took my dad's camera (nikon d5100 kit) and rolled. I cant say how i liked making photos. I didnt feel that alive for my hole life. And i started learning things about photo. \n\nSo, as i said, after my school i left to Poland to study. I still prefered my journalism 'hobby' over photo, i thought it will be more realistic to be a good journalist than a good photography guy for me. Turned out, that i can choose 'press and photography' and i was ducking happy. I'm on my 3 year now.\n\nFor this time, i've been learning photo a lot. I know pretty much about all photography theory stuff. I worked as a photographer in a tour company. We visited Europes cities and i was taking photos of people who were with this tour comp. But it was only 1 day per week. Salary was good - almost 50$ per day (i would mention, that its pretty good for poland, here on average work u get 4$ per hour. And i worked only 2 hours while that people had an excursion). But i couldnt live on 200$/month.  \n\nAlso, i managed to do photo sessions several times, just answering people who wrote in social medias that they are searching for photographer. But it was really rare (3 or 4 times over 2 years).\n\nCurrently, Im working on an average work so i can pay my rent, bills, food etc. But i dont want to work here. I cant find a work in photo-industry either. There are ONLY TWO work ads right now. Both from gigant firms, that wont even see my portoflio in those hundreds portfolios. \n\n  \nAlso im still visiting some concerts as a photographer, but i do it for free. Just to listen some music i like and to do some shots for my portfo.    \n\n\nI want to get money and do photography, but i just cant find those tip to get into industry. In future, Im pretty sure i want to do business and open my photostudio, but i dont have enough money for now. Im pretty suffering because of it. I dont even know whether my photos are good or no. \n\nRight now im trying to win some contests. First i found Gurushots. I tried it and than understood, that 90% photos there are trash (*thats not about quality of photos - there are porn photos from someone's home archives, screenshots from movies lol, and etc*). Then i found Shuttout.

      "selftext": "Dear Flickr Pros,\nFirst, and above all else: thank you. Thank you for being a part of our community. Thank you for caring about Flickr. Thank you for supporting Flickr. Thank you for being a Flickr Pro.\n\nTwo years ago, Flickr was losing tens of millions of dollars a year. Our company, SmugMug, stepped in to rescue it from being shut down and to save tens of billions of your precious photos from being erased.\n\nWhy? We\u2019ve spent 17 years lovingly building our company into a thriving, family-owned and -operated business that cares deeply about photographers. SmugMug has always been the place for photographers to showcase their photography, and we\u2019ve long admired how Flickr has been the community where they connect with each other. We couldn\u2019t stand by and watch Flickr vanish.\n\nSo we took a big risk, stepped in, and saved Flickr. Together, we created the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community: a place where photographers can stand out and fit in.\n\nAnd yet, Flickr\u2014the world\u2019s most-beloved, money-losing business\u2014still needs your help.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work improving Flickr. We hired an excellent, large staff of Support Heroes who now deliver support with an average customer satisfaction rating of above 90%. We got rid of Yahoo\u2019s login. We moved the platform and every photo to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the industry leader in cloud computing, and modernized its technology along the way. As a result, pages are already 20% faster and photos load 30% more quickly. Platform outages, including Pandas, are way down. Flickr continues to get faster and more stable, and important new features are being built once again.\n\nOur work is never done, but we\u2019ve made tremendous progress.\n\nFlickr still needs your help. It\u2019s still losing money. You, and hundreds of thousands of loyal Flickr members stepped up and joined Flickr Pro, for which we are eternally grateful. It\u2019s losing a lot less money than it was. But it\u2019s not yet making enough.\n\nWe need more Flickr Pro members if we want to keep the Flickr dream alive, and we need your help to share the story of Flickr.\n\nWe didn\u2019t buy Flickr because we thought it was a cash cow. Unlike platforms like Facebook, we also didn\u2019t buy it to invade your privacy and sell your data. We bought it because we love photographers, we love photography, and we believe Flickr deserves not only to live on but thrive. We think the world agrees; and we think the Flickr community does, too. But we cannot continue to operate it at a loss as we\u2019ve been doing.\n\nFlickr is the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community. It\u2019s the world\u2019s best way to find great photography and connect with amazing photographers. Flickr hosts some of the world\u2019s most iconic, most priceless photos, freely available to the entire world. This community is home to more than 100 million accounts and tens of billions of photos. It serves billions of photos every single day. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a priceless treasure for the whole world. And it costs money to operate. Lots of money.\n\nAs you know, Flickr is the best value in photo sharing anywhere in the world. Flickr Pro members get ad-free browsing for themselves and their visitors, advanced stats, unlimited full-quality storage for all their photos, plus premium features and access to the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community.\n\nPlease, help us spread the word. Help us make Flickr thrive. Help us ensure Flickr has a bright future. Every Flickr Pro subscription goes directly to keeping Flickr alive and creating great new experiences for photographers like you. We are building lots of great things for the Flickr community, but we need your help. We can do this together.\n\nWe\u2019re launching our end-of-year Pro subscription campaign on Thursday, December 26, but I want to give you a coupon code to share with friends, family, or anyone who shares your love of photography and community so they can enjoy the same 25% discount before the campaign starts.\n\nWe\u2019ve gone to great lengths to optimize Flickr for cost savings wherever possible, but the increasing cost of operating this enormous community and continuing to invest in its future will require a small price increase early in the new year, so this is truly the very best time to help everyone upgrade to a Pro membership.\n\nIf you value Flickr finally being independent, built for photographers and by photographers, we need your help.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nDon MacAskill\nCo-Founder, CEO &amp; Chief Geek\nSmugMug + Flickr\n\nPlease share coupon code 25in2019 or link below to give the gift of 25% off Flickr Pro now.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=25in2019",

Thank you for supporting Flickr. Thank you for being a Flickr Pro.\n\nTwo years ago, Flickr was losing tens of millions of dollars a year. Our company, SmugMug, stepped in to rescue it from being shut down and to save tens of billions of your precious photos from being erased.\n\nWhy? We\u2019ve spent 17 years lovingly building our company into a thriving, family-owned and -operated business that cares deeply about photographers. SmugMug has always been the place for photographers to showcase their photography, and we\u2019ve long admired how Flickr has been the community where they connect with each other. We couldn\u2019t stand by and watch Flickr vanish.\n\nSo we took a big risk, stepped in, and saved Flickr. Together, -----> -----> we !!!  created !!!  the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community: a place where photographers can stand out and fit in.\n\nAnd yet, Flickr\u2014the world\u2019s most-beloved, money-losing business\u2014still needs your help.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work improving Flickr. We hired an excellent, large staff of Support Heroes who now deliver support with an average customer satisfaction rating of above 90%. We got rid of Yahoo\u2019s login. We moved the platform and every photo to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the industry leader in cloud computing, and modernized its technology along the way. As a result, pages are already 20% faster and photos load 30% more quickly. Platform outages, including Pandas, are way down. Flickr continues to get faster and more stable, and important new features are being built once again.\n\nOur work is never done, but we\u2019ve made tremendous progress.\n\nFlickr still needs your help. It\u2019s still losing money. You, and hundreds of thousands of loyal Flickr members stepped up and joined Flickr Pro, for which we are eternally grateful. It\u2019s losing a lot less money than it was. But it\u2019s not yet making enough.\n\nWe need more Flickr Pro members if we want to keep the Flickr dream alive, and we need your help to share the story of Flickr.\n\nWe didn\u2019t buy Flickr because we thought it was a cash cow. Unlike platforms like Facebook, we also didn\u2019t buy it to invade your privacy and sell your data. We bought it because we love photographers, we love photography, and we believe Flickr deserves not only to live on but thrive. We think the world agrees; and we think the Flickr community does, too. But we cannot continue to operate it at a loss as we\u2019ve been doing.\n\nFlickr is the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community. It\u2019s the world\u2019s best way to find great photography and connect with amazing photographers. Flickr hosts some of the world\u2019s most iconic, most priceless photos, freely available to the entire world. This community is home to more than 100 million accounts and tens of billions of photos. It serves billions of photos every single day. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a priceless treasure for the whole world. And it costs money to operate. Lots of money.\n\nAs you know, Flickr is the best value in photo sharing anywhere in the world. Flickr Pro members get ad-free browsing for themselves and their visitors, advanced stats, unlimited full-quality storage for all their photos, plus premium features and access to the world\u2019s largest photographer-focused community.\n\nPlease, help us spread the word. Help us make Flickr thrive. Help us ensure Flickr has a bright future. Every Flickr Pro subscription goes directly to keeping Flickr alive and creating great new experiences for photographers like you. We are building lots of great things for the Flickr community, but we need your help. We can do this together.\n\nWe\u2019re launching our end-of-year Pro subscription campaign on Thursday, December 26, but I want to give you a coupon code to share with friends, family, or anyone who shares your love of photography and community so they can enjoy the same 25% discount before the campaign starts.\n\nWe\u2019ve gone to great lengths to optimize Flickr for cost savings wherever possible, but the increasing cost of operating this enormous community and continuing to invest in its future will require a small price increase early in the new year, so this is truly the very best time to help everyone upgrade to a Pro membership.\n\nIf you value Flickr finally being independent, built for photographers and by photographers, we need your help.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nDon MacAskill\nCo-Founder, CEO &amp; Chief Geek\nSmugMug + Flickr\n\nPlease share coupon code 25in2019 or link below to give the gift of 25% off Flickr Pro now.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=25in2019",

      "selftext": "Before I start, I will state that I do not believe either is 'better' or 'worse' than the other. I personally, am primarily a film user even on social nights (analog from photo to print or on cine film in the case of motion pictures, with scanning of final prints for further sharing or to recover photos that are hard to print in the darkroom via negative scanning), though prefer digital for action photography. This is all subjective, and is in no way an authority on anything ;)\n\n# Film Advantages for me\n\nMy reasons for choosing film as a primary medium (colour and black-and-white, darkroom all the way, apart from sharing and digital softcopy as backup/recovery and use digital action photography or extreme handheld low light photography where film falls apart) despite being the age of 24 born into the 'modern' time: I primarily take photos of social nights at houses/people with a lot of candid shots, landscapes, streets, and objects as an art form to give away to people, and have done odd jobs photographing events for people. \n\nI often use black-and-white, and gelatin-silver prints are just beautiful. It gets me off the PC for a while, and I can sit in the darkroom with an audiobook or music with my phone in a light-tight bag for this purpose. A time to zone out, even when doing prints on a paid basis for someone else and can do very good quality prints and can get my hands in there. I also love playing with chemistry, this is an added bonus. Watching the print appear in the tray under red-light is magical and this cannot be reproduced in any other way, no other process will match this in beauty. \n\nI have to think before I press the shutter, which is another reason why I like the darkroom. Even with digital, I also prefer manual focus. No other way to make gelatin silver prints even from digital masters at home on the cheap, whereas enlargers are very cheap. A darkroom setup will cost far less than a high end digital printer, and will enable you to do C-Type prints or gelatin-silver prints of insane enlargements with far lower costs. Ideal if you want full control over the process.\n\nI like the fact that film is forgiving when a shoe-flash is used, and it means I will use low ISO in poor lighting and will play around with flash filters etc, highlights are often perfectly retained with very little effort with negative film, split grade printing in the darkroom brings out highlights with ease and retains detail in the shadows, and is simple, quick and intuitive to do, on a film such as Ilford FP4+ and Ilford PAN 100. An example of this is a picture on a self-timer of me and my friend perfectly framed, with the handmade chessboard with us playing. The shadows and the black pieces and the white pieces with the highlights retain all their detail with ease and very little effort. I often develop in Ilford ID11 1+1, and mostly shoot 35mm with an SLR, though I have a couple of high quality compacts. I also use T-Grain films such as Tmax.\n\nI like that fun candid moments will appear only when we develop, giving an element of surprise for the others who may wish to see it. People end up with physical prints with social evenings from me. One of my good Chinese friends had a carefully crafted photo album when he left the UK for china at the end of his time here. \n\nAs for colour, I do shoot film for colour and process E6 myself, but mostly as transparencies. Nothing beats all gathering round a slide projector, and watching as your images have insane detail on the wall/screen. As transparencies are shot as-is, you compose the shot perfectly at the time. Very little post-processing is needed, short of playing with developer pH if you are playing around with that, or tweaking scans of the transparencies. Digital scanning if you want prints made of transparencies. \n\nTransparencies however are NOT at all forgiving with almost zero latitude, so your exposure is either spot on, or done for, especially if projection is your desired result. I shoot some colour negative film as well, and print RA4 in the darkroom, though with quite a bit of colour work, especially when I need to tweak the final image a bit, I adopt a hybrid workflow, scanning negatives and printing them digitally. \n\nHP Instant Ink has pushed the cost of creating good quality colour prints of A4 size or lower down at home. Using a flash or low-light social evenings with transparencies can be suicide unless you are very well-versed, and it would be advisable to bracket. I use Provia for this purpose, for it allows me to push +1 stop in processing with virtually no quality loss, and will allow +2 stops even, giving me a 400 speed high quality transparency film, which is enough if I shoot wide open. The discontinuation of Provia 400X was a loss, for this could give very good slides at 800 speed.\n\nWith big paper rolls, you can do it for as little as 4 pence a sheet, only your time and sanity calibrating colour filtration are needed. Hand-made RA4 prints in trays are satisfying. You can use a very dim orange safelight with a 7 1/2 watt bulb for colour papers or a calibrated lamp at 590nm wavelength at a distance, so your not in total darkness for colour prints. I also have a LED torch at similar wavelength.\n\nPaper cost is cheap, especially if you grab lots of 'partially used' paper boxes from people abandoning darkrooms or who have excess. Recently grabbed over 1000 sheets of different sizes for \u00a350. Chemistry is cheap, even ensuring all my fixer is only used for one session and replaced. \n\nI press the shutter, and it will fire instantly if it is armed, no quirks, no menus, no dying batteries from leaving a camera on constantly throughout the night. I can often focus from memory with little problems, and with a flash and a high F stop always gives me the focus I need and i will keep it set at an approximated setting if I think people are about to do something stupid. I find the lack of ANY delay whatsoever has given me candid moments that I may have missed otherwise, including a friend falling through a chair with her eyes crossed that happened so suddenly. The very act of turning a DSLR on or your phone app opening will often make you miss such a moment.\n\nSome digital cameras can be set this way, but I like the simplicity of leaving an armed camera within reach with no battery drain, and as such often carry a disposable on nights out to leave lying around and take many candid shots on my SLR. This quality enabled my friend to make me jump while carrying tea, and get the moment in perfect action with the water coming out of the cup (taken on a good quality disposable). Would not have been possible to hold a DSLR up without giving away what he was going to do. And 8x10 enlargement with good enough detail was possible.\n\nEquipment lifespan. Still am able to use the same film SLR as I was in 2010 when I first got into film.\n\nNegatives will always be view able, I suspect long before raw digital file formats of today become hard to open. I treat a negative as I would a digital raw file. It was my love for film that meant all my digital work is shot in raw, no questions asked, though for me to tweak the process. It has also made me careful even with a DSLR and I will seldom fill a card unless I am doing 4K video.\n\n# Film Disadvantages for me\n\nPointless for action photography when you try and take many. Reloading film during action will cause you to miss the action, 36 exposures (35mm) is not enough for an action session. A memory card can hold way more than that The high ISOs with high shutter speeds needed if in lower light will result in far lower quality on film unless you have good lighting, as film above ISO 400 - 800 can be very grainy and can look very nice if developed properly with a look you want, but unless your using medium format or large format will fall apart if you try and make big enlargements of such a film. The loss of Provia 400X was a blow here when it was discontinued. I am glad kodak bought back TMax 3200 however, for this was very good in poor light for 12x16 enlargements and may have me revisit film for this purpose.\n\nLow light performance of digital in terms of raw quality will outstrip film, and will probably run rings around it if you do not wish to use a flash. Trying to shoot an ISO 3200 film with the lens stopped all the way open and trying to focus a gathering with a very narrow depth of field is like walking on a tightrope, though is perfectly doable, and I have done it. A decent DSLR could give you better quality and an extra stop or two of speed if you require it.\n\nDust, dust, dust. Trying to get dust off a negative while printing it. A single tiny hair you did not see while preparing the print? Time to make a new one. I use a condenser enlarger, further compounding this problem. This is probably for me the biggest gripe. Digital is less stressful in this regard. And sometimes, my sanity can be tested. I now run an air purifier and ensure darkrooms are kept as clean as possible, but still... trying to remove dust from your negative is a nighmare straight from the depths of hell. Black-and-White films (apart from C41 ones) cannot make use of digital ICE due to the silver content when scanning, though you can correct for this in photoshop.\n\nNegatives are fragile. You must care for them and handle them with care if you want to make more gelatin silver prints. Digital media is far more robust. Use digital for backup high-resolution scans, always. I keep all mine filed, and have often had to go back to certain negatives more than once when people want more prints for someone else.\n\nDigital is a one-time purchase for equipment and software bar paper and consumables or lab printing, and if you are not to worry about printing most of your work, is probably the way to go unless you enjoy film workflow for other reasons. My Nikon DSLR has given flawless service bar needing a new battery. Film has on-going costs, but these are not too bad if you process at home and scan at home.\n\nScanning in good quality is time consuming if you have many photos. Digital can have a more streamlined workflow, if you need to do a high quantity of good quality pictures, as you need not prepare every print once you have calibrated your print.\n\nSharing with the world, need I say more? The very act of sharing photos here is a hybrid solution even if film is used.\n\nNot as small as the smallest digital cameras if size really does matter, though a lightweight disposable can be good, but unless you want it for the candid value, your smartphone would probably do better if you have a flagship model or reasonable model.\n\nHP Instant Ink and other similar services have started to close the gap on the cost magins, though premium digital papers are still expensive. I do not use no-name or cheap digital paper, I want the print to be stable long-term so when people view memories made by me decades later, it will still look as good as the day we shot it. \n\nThe need to carry multiple cameras if you wish to shoot both colour/black-and-white at the same event. Extra weight.\n\nNo video capability on still film cameras, if you need quick access to high quality video, a DSLR will give you this option.\n\nSome film stocks can be hard to come by. A discontinuation of a favourite film stock is heartbreaking if you have not already stocked up, ebay prices will then go into the stratosphere. Provia 400X was one such example, and I am resigned to the fact Fuji will discontinue Provia 100F, which is my favourite for colour work due to my liking of transparencies. My freezer has quite a bit of it. \n\nDifficult to find people who understand a darkroom process and digital post may be more time efficient depending on the skill of the operator, thus for most professional work unless you want your own darkroom, digital is the way to go.\n\n# Summary\n\nFilm being my favourite, I have room for both Digital and Film in my work. Both can be fun in their own way, depending on the workflow you want. As being sat in front of screen is not something I enjoy too much for long hours, especially as I do a lot of writing and thus spend a lot of time in front of a screen, I like the darkroom as a getaway from that.\n\nDigital has advantages mentioned above that film cannot compete with in my opinion, though to be both are simply tools in your box that you may use as you wish, and other experiences may differ from mine. As silver gelatin prints, and project able transparencies are often my end goal, film therefore suits me. Projectable colour cine film is also a fun addition.\n\nA digital softcopy/backup is essential for your good work, regardless if you wish to share it or not. I often scan my prints over my negatives, as I have to do very little correction.\n\nJust had too much time on my hands today!\n\nSo what do you prefer guys, and why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

There are 3 layers of this foam with gaps between them.\n\nIm pretty happy with the results, but I think there might be better materials out there than the foam I am using. Can anybody else suggest materials that have worked well for them to diffuse flashes?\n\nHere is the setup: https://i.imgur.com/L1kxdXV.jpg\n\nExample photo: https://i.imgur.com/rXvej0x.jpg",

I already have [some examples on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/Down-Flower/gallery/64806497/Photo%20Manipulation), but I feel I would like to practice more before considering the option. So, I request from you, some photos that are faded, crinkled, torn, discolored. Maybe even with an unsightly image, like an ex boyfriend that you want removed. Anything like that. And they can be photos of anything. Scan them to your computer if possible before submitting.

Not sure if this belongs here, please suggest better subreddit if not. /!/  Hi guys, I'm thinking of opening up commissions for the first time, but I need to practice first. My main focus will be photo restoration. I already have [some examples on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/Down-Flower/gallery/64806497/Photo%20Manipulation), but I feel I would like to practice more before considering the option. So, I request from you, some photos that are faded, crinkled, torn, discolored. Maybe even with an unsightly image, like an ex boyfriend that you want removed. Anything like that. And they can be photos of anything. Scan them to your computer if possible before submitting. If not, please let me know that it's a photo of a photo, and of course please detail the work you want done to it.  \n\n\nFor now, I am providing this restoration and editing service completely free of charge and you can quote me on that.

But one photo, in particular, is now raising eyebrows after sharp-eyed readers noticed something strange about it.\n\n&gt;\u201cPlease do some research on a subject before misrepresenting the true night sky,\u201d writes a commenter named Greg Stevens on the Facebook post. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong these are nice \u2018picture\u2019 but some of them have had the clone stamp used to create a false Milky Way and this should have been made clear before publishing.\u201d\n\nHer response, where she blames and un-blames a nameless somebody else:\n\n&gt;I am late to this discussion as I am attending my father\u2019s funeral. First, I want to say that I am not much for technical expertise. For me, it\u2019s not about the equipment. For these pictures I developed a fairly simple formula and memorized it, varying adjustments occasionally to suit the light. I also usually take my time producing work, but this work under starlight was the exception. With three back to back trips and a book deadline I enlisted the help of an intern seven years ago. During her 6 month term she helped to batch process images and she also hand-stitched the panoramic shot in question. I got back in touch with her to ask her about this process. She remembers stitching the images together one by one, lining up the tree branches by using the transformation tool to line each shot up. I believe the problem stemmed from the distortion of the wide angle lens used. She claims she did not use the clone tool. To be clear, I am not passing the blame on to her. My name is on it and I take full responsibility.",

But one photo, in particular, is now raising eyebrows after sharp-eyed readers noticed something strange about it.\n\n&gt;\u201cPlease do some research on a subject before misrepresenting the true night sky,\u201d writes a commenter named Greg Stevens on the Facebook post. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong these are nice \u2018picture\u2019 but some of them have had the clone stamp used to create a false Milky Way and this should have been made clear before publishing.\u201d\n\nHer response, where she blames and un-blames a nameless somebody else:\n\n&gt;I am late to this discussion as I am attending my father\u2019s funeral. First, I want to say that I am not much for technical expertise. For me, it\u2019s not about the equipment. For these pictures -----> -----> I !!!  developed !!!  a fairly simple formula and memorized it, varying adjustments occasionally to suit the light. I also usually take my time producing work, but this work under starlight was the exception. With three back to back trips and a book deadline I enlisted the help of an intern seven years ago. During her 6 month term she helped to batch process images and she also hand-stitched the panoramic shot in question. I got back in touch with her to ask her about this process. She remembers stitching the images together one by one, lining up the tree branches by using the transformation tool to line each shot up. I believe the problem stemmed from the distortion of the wide angle lens used. She claims she did not use the clone tool. To be clear, I am not passing the blame on to her. My name is on it and I take full responsibility.",
