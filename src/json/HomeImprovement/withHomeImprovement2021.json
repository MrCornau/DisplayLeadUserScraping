I'm not from here originally, so I had no idea what a \"seismic retrofit\" was either before we bought our first house last Fall and saw it called out on the home inspection. In short: most of the wood-framed houses in this area were built without sufficient side-to-side (\"shear\") strength on their lower (\"cripple\") walls to withstand the forces of a big earthquake. They can slide off the foundation or collapse completely. Not good. Over the years, structural engineers have come up with ways to retrofit existing houses with plywood and some special metal connectors to add the strength they need.\n\n([Read more about seismic retrofits and \"shear walls\" here](http://www.shearwalls.com/)\u2014 I can also recommend the book sold on this site as a good DIY resource)\n\n# Why did I do this (myself)?\n\nRetrofitting your house in this way is, surprisingly, completely optional.

I heard numbers ranging from $25,000 - $45,000 for this sort of thing if you went with a full service contractor. So most of the houses we looked at buying simply didn't have the work done. Chalk this up as one more crazy thing about buying a house in this area.

I was able to do it all while comfortably standing up and could load tools and materials in at ground level through the garage.\n\n# What did I have to do?\n\nImgur album here shows some of the process: [https://imgur.com/a/8Qeg57U](https://imgur.com/a/8Qeg57U)\n\nThe basic process involves the creation of several strong \"shear walls\" throughout the floor plan of the house. Constructing these requires:\n\n* Drilling holes through the existing mudsill and into the foundation for anchor bolts\n* Installing anchor bolts with structural epoxy to tie the mudsills to the foundation\n* Installing metal connector hardware to tie the floor above to the walls below\n* Installing additional stud framing within the designated shear walls\n* Installing metal hold downs to tie the framing into the foundation within the shear walls\n* Cutting to size and nailing plywood to the face of the shear walls\n\nThe engineering involved to know exactly how many shear walls are needed, where to place them, and the details of their construction is not really a DIY process, and I needed to have plans drawn up by a real licensed engineer in order to get money back from the city, so I hired that part out. Note that many houses can use a free set of standard plans called [\"Plan Set A\"](https://abag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/plan-set-a.pdf) which gives conservative guidelines for many homes, but I could not use it because the cripple walls in my house are too tall.\n\nUnfortunately the engineer's plans came back with one additional complication: he specified a new foundation footing to be poured in the middle of the house so that one of the interior walls could be constructed as a shear wall. Just anchoring it down to the concrete slab would not suffice. So I had to cut open the slab, excavate down 24\" for the footing, and pour new concrete.
