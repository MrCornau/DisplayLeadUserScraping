So I'm looking for a way to temporarily disable a lock in a way that will keep it stuck for a while. First of all, I'd like to explain why I'm doing this so that none of you would think I'm some thief or criminal.\n\nUnfortunately, my family shares the house with my mum's uncle and aunt. The house is split into two apartments, ours which is on the ground floor and theirs on the first floor. The uncle is a crazy old fart who keeps imagining that someone is entering our yard all the time, stealing his stuff, etc. He also likes to mess with us so he sometimes removes light bulbs in the stairway which both apartments share so that we can't turn the light on, deliberately tests his home alarm at 7 AM at weekends, puts threads around his doors to see if they'd been opened while he was gone. The guy is basically Kevin from Home Alone movie, only 80 years old.\n\nLately, he also started banging stuff on the floor in the evening to make us think there's another earthquake (our city had a couple of stronger ones in 2020, the first time after 100 years). Since we share a yard, he also started to lock the fence door on purpose, claiming he saw someone stealing in his part of the garden (completely unnecessary since we literally have nothing valuable outside, all the tools are locked in the garage or basement).  This wouldn't be such a big problem if he wasn't doing it just to annoy us 95% of the time. For example, he sees me going to the store from his window - it's weekend morning, tons of neighbours in the street, broad daylight. When I leave the house the door is perfectly unlocked. When I come back with hands full of groceries, he, OF COURSE, locked the door in the meantime and I have to struggle with the stuff and fiddle to find the key.  Another example: Sometimes I come home late, something like 11 PM and find the door unlocked. The next morning the door is locked when I go to work at 7 AM. Since he's retired that means that he only got up to lock it before I leave, knowing I'll yet again have to rummage my bag for key and possibly miss the bus which stops just in front of our house!!!\n\nSO BACK TO THE TOPIC\n\nI am looking for a way to disable a lock just for a day or couple hours. It has to look like it happened accidentally or like something that can be blamed on neighbourhood kids. It would be ideal if it was something that I could do real quick before leaving for work, pour something into the lock to make it freeze or something. I just wanna give him some work and annoy him a bit, nothing big and unfixable. Since the temperature will soon be dropping below freezing, I've been thinking about getting the chewing gum stuck in a keyhole in the evening and leaving it to freeze until morning (the fence is low and I can easily jump over it if necessary). a\n\nSo if anyone has some better idea how to make this prank I'd be grateful.
