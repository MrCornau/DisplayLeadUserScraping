And thinking about going back to school /!/ Hi yall - looking for some advice and coming from the opposite perspective of a lot of posts I see on here. I currently work for one of the major giant tech companies doing computer vision work. Several years ago this would have been my dream job and I do feel incredibly fortunate as I feel I've lucked into some positions and roles that a lot of folks really want. The problem is I just don't love it like I thought I would and I'm thinking about getting a PhD. From a lifetime earnings perspective, I already know that's a terrible life choice, but life isn't just about making money and I want to do something I'm passionate about. Right now I just feel like I'm stuck doing a bunch of hyperparameter tuning and kicking off a zillion experiments. I don't have as much time to implement new architectures and interesting ideas from papers I read - partly because I'm one of the lower people on the totem pole. Also there are a lot of research ideas I want to pursue that we don't have immediate customers for mostly because we may be a couple years of work away from something really useful. The problem is, I don't want to just be a green grass chaser and give up my current salary to do something that I also don't love. Even if I decide it makes sense to go back to school, I'm not sure how to go about it as a lot of programs require recommendation letters from academic faculty, rather than industry colleagues.
