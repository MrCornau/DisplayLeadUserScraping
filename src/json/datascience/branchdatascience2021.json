Moreover, individuals from different backgrounds became interested in following a career as data scientists. Therefore, providing a quantitative guide for individuals and organizations to understand the skills required in the job market would be crucial. This paper introduces a framework to analyze the job market for data science-related jobs within the US while providing an interface to access insights in this market. The proposed framework includes three sub-modules allowing continuous data collection, information extraction, and a web-based dashboard visualization to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of data science-related jobs and skills. The result of this work shows important skills for the main branches of data science jobs and attempts to provide a skill-based definition of these data science branches. The current version of this application is deployed on the web and allows individuals and institutes to investigate skills required for data science positions through the industry lens.\n\n## Method\n\n### Overview of data science skill tracking system\n\nThe figure shows an overview of the proposed system. Each of these modules will be described in more detail in the following. As it can be seen in this Figure, this system heavily relies on cloud computing structures that provide stable facilities for continuous tasks with scheduling to collect, analyze, and present its findings dynamically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ja61cyk7g871.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6044688fe26178a0022bb19896a7f45b9c64d985\n\n### Data Collection Sample\n\nThis shows samples of the returned fields for queries on data analysts. For a framework like the one presented, it is not feasible to use a local machine for data collection as it requires to work continuously for a long period of time with no interruptions (such as internet disconnection or power outage, etc.). Such a machine and maintaining its connectivity would cause a lot of hassle and scrapy cloud services solve this problem by understanding the data collection framework. It allows to create periodic jobs to continuously collect the data using this platform. This module runs its data collection spiders every week and samples job postings on the web periodically. The results of these queries are then delivered into a mysql database on Amazon web services (AWS) for further processing that will be explained in the next section.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/730j1q5m7g871.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea6d4798cae91bd0e61ca515494c883d56d67ca3\n\n### Interaction graph of visualization components\n\nThe effect and interactions between these components are complex. Figure shows these interactions in our dash model. As it can be seen the spatial and temporal aspect of skills could be investigated by using these components. Other components would be added as the work continues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kqodcfn7g871.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66d03e66d4eb226f2dd6323aebc124bcb5ff6758\n\n### Top 20 results based on no. job by states and company\n\nThis Table shows the top 20 companies during this period. Despite the expectation that tech sector dominate the field, it appears that other sectors contribute to this market significantly. Namely, consultant and advisory section (e.g. Booz Allen, Deloitte)and financial institutes(e.g JPMorgan, Wells Fargo) and government organization contribute significantly to this market along with the tech sector.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p85utw8o7g871.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e95b15d43045b194660983296a6f092e4433d308\n\n### Top skills for the three main tracks\n\nThis Table shows the top 20 skills in each job posting category. The result in this table clearly shows the difference between these main tracks of data science. While machine learning engineer job postings mostly shows a domination of skills such as programming, machine learning, cloud, and big data technologies, a data analyst mostly needs skills for data retrieving (e.g. SQL, Excel,database), and Visualization (e.g Tableau, Power BI).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/434pusrp7g871.png?width=971&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef20eeac233a97c50544d1b6f575a8d4480dc173\n\n### Temporal insights of data science skills\n\nLeft Figure shows this comparison between top programming languages mentioned during this period.As it can be seen, the top language is python following by R and Java. This indicated not only python is the most dominant language but the trend and the gap shows it appears to be in demand in future in comparison to others. Similarly, a comparison between deep learning framework is presented in right Figure. The result shows that tensorflow followed by pytorch are the most mentioned deep learning frameworks. Also H2O\\~(an R based package) is mentioned much less which indicates the overwhelming attention to python for deep learning. As it can be seen, the framework allows temporal insights to this job market and based on their general importance, such insights can be added to the interface designed for users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper introduces a framework capable of collecting and analysing of spatial and temporal aspects of data science's job market using available tools within data science toolbox. The framework provides a free front-end interface developed using plotly dash for this market. The result provides a quantitative guide for individuals and organizations to recognize the most important skills and concepts in this domain based on industry perception. Possible extension to the work here includes sector analysis of job posting and improving on skill extraction technique. Other temporal insights will be added to the interface based on the importance of the information they can add for individuals using this interface.\n\n## Error and Comments:\n\nSend an email to

Increased O 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin.\n\n Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them.

It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.\\[1\\] Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\\[2\\]\\[3\\] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.\\[4\\] In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine \u2013 see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.'''\n\n\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#Predict on text data with T5\n\npipe.predict(data)\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n| Predicted summary| Text |

decompression sickness (the \u2019bends\u2019) are sometimes treated using these devices. increased o 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin.\n\n oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. increasing the pressure of o 2 as soon as possible is part of the

calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. it has two major -----> branches !!! , differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. these two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.\\[1\\] infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz.\\[2\\]\\[3\\] today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.\\[4\\] in mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. the word calculus (plural calculi) is a latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine \u2013 see calculus (medicine)). because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. it is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.'''\n\n\\]\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n\\#predict on text data with t5\n\npipe.predict(data)\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n| predicted summary| text |

I haven't finished the degree yet, but I'm far enough into it that I can give an honest assessment for those interested in enrolling.\n\n# First, the good stuff:\n\n* Eastern University puts their students first. The professors, administrators, and admissions staff at EU have it together when it comes to solving problems and interacting with students. They usually respond to my emails within an hour and give helpful feedback.\n* EU is *super* military-friendly. I'm using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to fund my studies. If you have 100% GI Bill, then you get a degree for free and pocket *at least* $15k in stipends. Even if you only have 60% GI Bill like I do, you'll still net around $6k. At Eastern, you only need to take *one class* at a time to qualify as a full-time student, so you can collect that $894/month stipend while only enrolled in a single class. They also offer a $30 per credit discount for veterans and active duty personnel. If you're using tuition assistance while serving, the *whole program* will only cost you $500 out of pocket, which is an *insanely* good deal for a graduate degree.\n* Everything is self-directed. No weekly modules. If you burn the midnight oil, you can finish an entire seven-week course in just a week or two! That's quite convenient if you're a full-time working professional with an unpredictable schedule.\n* The professor's videos give a clear description on how to use programming languages. I enrolled with *zero* programming experience, but they hold your hand through the whole thing and explain in detail how it all works at a theoretical level. I usually have the instructional videos open in one window and my Python editor open in another so I can pause and play around with it. It's an effective way to learn.\n\n# And, there are a few drawbacks:\n\n* Academically, it's not super challenging. For example, all the assignments can be retaken until you get the grade you want. Also, as an online program, it's possible for an unscrupulous student to cheat their way through, although I have no idea why someone would spend all this money on a degree to learn data science and then just \"coast\" through the program. If you want to gain proficiency with Python, R, statistics, etc., you'll have to practice writing code and crunching numbers on your own in addition to the class assignments. They do, however, provide you with all the learning materials you need to gain proficiency.\n* The student account website isn't the most user-friendly. Simply signing up for a new class is a drawn-out, cumbersome process that took me a while to figure out. The learning management system they use, Brightspace, isn't the most efficient either.\n\n# The bottom line:\n\nI know this sounds cliche, but **you'll get out of this program what you put into it**. If you only do the bare minimum to pass each course, you can pay all this money just to get a fancy diploma, but lack the data science knowledge to succeed in the real world. If you go the extra mile and take time to master the material on your own, you'll have a strong enough foundation in data science to get into the industry, gain experience, and build a successful career in a lucrative field. EU's program is a convenient and affordable option for working professionals who want to branch out into data science and have the motivation to work for it.\n\n# And now, I'll answer a few Frequently Asked Questions:\n\n**How much time per week would I need to put in as a student?**  \nIt varies depending on how much time you need to practice and how many classes you take. Each course is seven weeks long. I've been taking one course per term while working full-time as a civil engineer, part-time as a national guard officer, and taking care of my 9-month old daughter and I still have had plenty of time to finish each class with a few weeks to spare. If you plan ahead each week, it's possible to balance this program with a full-time job.  \n\n\n**Eastern University isn't as prestigious/high-ranking as (for example) UT-Austin or Georgia Tech. How will employers judge a degree from EU?**  \nI wouldn't worry too much about university rankings. Once you're in the industry and have experience, no one cares where you got your degree. You'll also find that many data scientists are completely self-taught and have degrees in unrelated subjects. Some of them don't have degrees at all! For example, my brother attended a bottom-tier, open-enrollment university and studied computer science for a few semesters before dropping out. Even though he never finished his degree, he became proficient at writing code and now makes six figures as a software engineer. All you have to do is get good enough at writing the code to pass a technical interview to make yourself marketable.  \n\n\n**Do I even need a degree for this career field? Isn't it possible to learn data science simply by watching YouTube videos?**  \nYes, it is possible to learn data science on your own, but the structure of a degree program makes it easier to keep a consistent study schedule. It also gives you something palpable to list on a resume when you start applying for jobs. As I've stated earlier, many private sector tech companies are loose on degree requirements, *however* government and military jobs stipulate certain degrees for their applicants. I currently work for DOD as an engineer, and every time I apply for a new position within our department, I have to submit my transcript along with it. An MS in Data Science can help you land a federal job as a data engineer, operations research analyst, statistician, etc. \n\nIf you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mmvd91/eastern_university_ms_in_data_science_my_review/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "datascience", "result": true, "Selector": "branch", "selectorShort": "branch", "MarkedSent": "eastern university - ms in data science | my review /!/ so i'm currently enrolled in [eastern university's online ms in data science](https://www.eastern.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-data-science). i haven't finished the degree yet, but i'm far enough into it that i can give an honest assessment for those interested in enrolling.\n\n# first, the good stuff:\n\n* eastern university puts their students first. the professors, administrators, and admissions staff at eu have it together when it comes to solving problems and interacting with students. they usually respond to my emails within an hour and give helpful feedback.\n* eu is *super* military-friendly. i'm using the post-9/11 gi bill to fund my studies. if you have 100% gi bill, then you get a degree for free and pocket *at least* $15k in stipends. even if you only have 60% gi bill like i do, you'll still net around $6k. at eastern, you only need to take *one class* at a time to qualify as a full-time student, so you can collect that $894/month stipend while only enrolled in a single class. they also offer a $30 per credit discount for veterans and active duty personnel. if you're using tuition assistance while serving, the *whole program* will only cost you $500 out of pocket, which is an *insanely* good deal for a graduate degree.\n* everything is self-directed. no weekly modules. if you burn the midnight oil, you can finish an entire seven-week course in just a week or two!

When i first started at this clinic i was a research coordinator for one of the studies and had not yet started grad school, but told them I had plans to in the future, which they encouraged.\n\nWhile I was working as a coordinator, I entered a Neuroscience PhD program at that same local university, and since then I've been permitted to work remotely for my job half of the time in order to accommodate the requirements of my degree. I'm in my third (out of 5) year of the PhD program. The clinic has been very flexible and accommodating of my PhD work. I still have to work full time but I can do some of that work from the lab or at home. Part of the reason they've been so flexible is because my PhD advisors are on the same grants as the clinic and we do a great deal of collaborative research together.

/!/ i'm (36f) a data manger at a very large (international) research clinic and i manage the databases for two large nih grant-funded research studies on dementia and alzheimer's disease - these studies involve collaboration between the clinic and the local university - the clinic does research with the patient population and the university does complementary research with animal models and fluid biomarkers from the clinic patients. when i first started at this clinic i was a research coordinator for one of the studies and had not yet started grad school, but told them i had plans to in the future, which they encouraged.\n\nwhile i was working as a coordinator, i entered a neuroscience phd program at that same local university, and since then i've been permitted to work remotely for my job half of the time in order to accommodate the requirements of my degree. i'm in my third (out of 5) year of the phd program. the clinic has been very flexible and accommodating of my phd work. i still have to work full time but i can do some of that work from the lab or at home. part of the reason they've been so flexible is because my phd advisors are on the same grants as the clinic and we do a great deal of collaborative research together. however, when this \"promotion\" to data manager happened at the clinic, i did not receive a salary increase and my salary is prettyyyy bad for the field: about $3k net per month in a relatively expensive city. \n\ni struggle with asking for more because they have been so accommodating of my schooling. they seem to have the mentality that i'm just a grad student so they don't need to pay me like an adult (again i'm friggin' 36 years old, so i'm very much an adult. i do look young, and i think people just assume i'm like 25. cool most of the time but not for salary negotiations). but there are several reasons why i think it would be reasonable to ask for more:\n\n1. the average pay for this position is almost twice what i make, and my responsibilities and experience have both increased quite a bit since i started with the clinic.\n\n2. we received \"merit increases\" of 1.5% this year, which is the only raise i've had in the last 3 years. this doesn't even keep up with inflation, and the housing market in my city has exploded with homes prices being about 20% higher than last year.\n\n3. my split time at the clinic and university may actually be an asset to the clinic. we have two large databases we are trying to maintain for these studies, and none of the data from the university collaborators has been integrated into these yet. so by spending half my time at the school and maintaining relationships with the scientists there (i have very good relationships with most of them), i'm well situated for getting this data into our database and creating a full central repository for our studies. i have the technical knowledge of all of these -----> branches !!!  of science that other employees at the clinic and other potential applicants simply will not have. i didn't have much database knowledge when u started but that had been easy to pick up. my manager had expressed his desire for me to learn some of the back end coding as well as some statistical analysis and i plan to do that once we have all the databases fully set up and integrated. \n\nso, i have informally broached the subject once with my manager and he said we should discuss it with the budgeting team, since my pay comes from grant funds and we would have to figure out if there is money available to increase my pay (from my previous experience i'd guess this shouldn't be a  problem). my manager doesn't really directly deal with pay issues, but his approval would be necessary. as far as actually getting the increase to happen, this would be more likely the role if my supervisor.  i would honestly stay with this company for life if they would just pay me what i'm worth. i have a meeting this friday with my supervisor and plan to be much more assertive about requesting a pay increase. my questions are:\n\n1. do you have any general tips for effective salary negotiations. do you see a specific strategy that you think would work in these circumstances?\n\n2. from your experiences in this field do you think i can demand much more? \n\n3. if so, how do you successfully navigate asking for a large salary increase?\n\n4. if they're not willing to increase my pay, would it be difficult to find another job that would accommodate my phd work? \n\n\ntl;dr please help me get a raise!!! i haven't had one in years and my pay sucks for what i do. i'm a data manager doing a neuroscience phd and my friend who makes sandwiches in denver makes more than i do \ud83d\ude3f", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 1, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/q6sgdt/tips_for_salary_negotiation/',)", "identifyer": 5593372, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "HoomanGroovin", "date": 1624544559000, "content": "How to pathway into data science industry?

Keep in mind that this wasn't a small startup, this was a huge Company (&gt; 10k employees).\n\nIt started when I applied for the position online, they responded after over a month, once I already had several offers. What was interesting was that they were the only company that called me as their first response and did not send a mail, which was a surprise but not a deal breaker to me. They wanted to make a short Teams interview, which I accepted since I wanted to have the Interview Training, but would only consider them if they would be a really great fit.\n\nSo far so good, we arrange an interview for the following Monday at 1 pm in the call.\n\nAbout 3 Hours after the call, they send me a Teams link via Mail, which was written pretty unprofessionally, and looked like they they hadn't put much thought in it. What I immediately notice was that the Teams Link they send me was for 11:30 am on Monday, not 1 pm like we had agreed upon, which was really strange. So I send them a mail asking when the Interview **really** is, and that I would be fine with both timeframes, but would like to know when. I get a response back about 2 hours later, saying that the other employee that would be present can't get to it at 1 pm, so they decided to move the Interview. I immediately see the red flag, they had just moved the Interview, without talking to me first, and didnt even think of telling me. I shrug it off and told them it was fine, since I was not planning on taking the job anyways.\n\nFast forward to Monday 11:30 am:\n\nI join the Teams Meeting, they start out with a little small talk/chit-chat. And we proceed to the Interview. They talk a little about what they do (at max 2 minutes) and then ask me to introduce myself, which I do and then we just do a standard interview which goes great for the most part. What they really emphasized at multiple points, was that they wanted to have an Intern for \"A long time\" so they were really straight forward, asking me for how many years I will study CS (probably so they can know for how long they can get away with paying me less), and proceed to talk about how they \"Keep their Interns for a long time\".\n\nThen one of them starts to list all the people in their branch, which was weird, since he didn't list a single Data Scientist (The role that the internship was for), which made me suspicious. Then, in the middle of the Interview I get to ask some Questions, so I ask what they will expect from the intern and what kind of task he be responsible for. When they answered I immediately thought \"Wow, that sounds alot like a Python Developer Role, not Data Science\", which made sense since they kept asking for my python skills, which as itself is not a problem since I am very comfortable with my Python knowledge, but it made me really sceptical, so I keep asking more specific Questions until im am certain of it. Since I was 100% sure that this wasn't a DS Role and I was not worried of not getting the Job, I ask \"Why did you call the Job listing Data Science when it sounds alot like a Python Developer Role?\". The answer was not what I thought, one of the Interviewers straight up told me to my face that they \"knew it was not a DS role, but decided to call it that anyway since its such a great buzzword, and they would get a lot more applicants that way\" (this is as close to a 100% quote as I can recall, so this is not exaggerated) , which really made me speechless. After that I just decided to play nice until the Interview was over, but had already decided that I was not going to take their offer, if they would make me one.\n\nFast Forward 2 Weeks:\n\nAfter they had told me that they would get back to me by the end of the Week, they didn't, and after two weeks I receive an Email that they had decided for another applicant (that poor dude). My guess is that they smelled that I didn't want to take the job anyways and if I did, I would not stay for long since it became pretty clear that I knew they were full of shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas this happened to any of you?

Learn about her role, what she does, and in particular how there are different branches of research at Facebook AI.\n\nThe cool thing about working at Facebook AI as an applied researcher is that you not only have a big impact on the research community through the work you do, but you\u2019re also able to have a big impact on Facebook\u2019s product direction and the millions of users on the platform.\n\nHope you enjoy the interview.\n\n\\-------\n\n## Can you tell me a bit about what you work on at Facebook?\n\nI work at Facebook AI, particularly applied research, as a Research Scientist, developing computer vision models for AR use cases. Our models eventually go from research to production.\n\nA lot of our work also revolves around data - so it\u2019s not just modelling. For example, in computer vision, we need to figure out what data we train our models with, what is important for the user, and how to annotate this data (for ex: what\u2019s the timeline). So a lot of this work usually involves collaboration with data scientists and data engineers.\n\nSince our models eventually go into production, we also work closely with product managers to fine tune different use cases and implementation practices.\n\nI\u2019m based in Menlo Park, California, USA.\n\n## What set of skills is your team seeking for and how can someone join your team?\n\nThere are many different roles that Facebook AI hires, such as these categories:\n\n* Research Scientist and Software Engineer with ML and deep learning background.\n* UXR, Product designer, product manager\n* App developer as we have prototype team\n\nWe either directly hire people into our teams, mostly Research Scientists or we hire from boot camps where people are hired into facebook but not positioned at a particular team. At facebook, most are hired without team selection.\n\nDirect hires into teams are likely high stake engineers or researchers with particular research backgrounds that the teams are early looking for. So in this case, the recruiter would reach out to published researchers in the field in which Facebook is looking to hire.\n\n## Is your team focused on theoretical research, applied research or both? Can you give us some examples of what type of work you are doing and who you collaborate with?\n\nCompared with FAIR labs who work on pure research goals with a \\~5 years vision, our project is often &lt; 2 years long, and each project is started with particular use cases in mind such as product surfaces where our models will be launched on, deployed in cloud or on-device. Our work consists of both research and MLOps and our time is split into 3 chunks (1) data collection and data annotation, (2) modeling, and (3) work cross-functionally with product teams to scope proper use cases.\n\nResearch that is conducted under FAIR labs will often not even have a use case. But for us, we know that there is a real-world use case that our research needs to satisfy. So for example, within computer vision, our image detection model might have the specific use case of trying to identify fraudulent ads in mind.\n\nIt\u2019s cool to get to work both on the research side and the production side. The beginning of a project is obviously more research heavy, and then towards the end we collaborate more and more with other stakeholders.\n\nThe contrast between both types of tasks can be challenging at times. This is because when you do research, it\u2019s a different mind state to when you have to actually identify and map out use cases that real world users will be impacted by. The latter is more of a product engineering or product management type task.\n\nSo you get to talk to all kinds of different people, like some who are actually creating apps that users interact with, others like UI designers who are crafting the user experience, etc. I find all of this really enjoyable.\n\n## Tell me a bit more about some of these projects you\u2019re working on.\n\nOne of my projects is related to object detection based on different user personas. This is a novel and challenging research project that doesn\u2019t have too much current literature in the academic space, so it\u2019s exciting.\n\nThis is a project that we\u2019ve already secured 2 or 3 different use cases for and we are currently in the research phase.\n\n## Do you enjoy the research part more or the product use case part more of a project?\n\nEach project has different time periods. During research mode, as I mentioned earlier, you don\u2019t really want to do too much cross-functional collaboration because you\u2019re heads down reading academic papers and doing a lot of computational heavy work.\n\nBut during the planning stage, so even before the research has begun, there\u2019s a lot of room for discussion with other colleagues and you\u2019re able to bounce ideas off each other. This process can be really fun too.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to remember that the research we do is very useful for real-world users, so there\u2019s an opportunity for big impact. There\u2019s also an opportunity to shape the product direction of the company.\n\n## How is work life balance like at Facebook?\n\nI will say that remote work due to the pandemic has often blurred the line between work and free-time because there\u2019s often no end to research (there\u2019s always something you can do!). And all of us enjoy our work, so it\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap of overworking and burning out.\n\nI think that as an intern, in general, you skew more towards the work side of things because you\u2019re trying to prove yourself and get a return offer. So interns at companies like Facebook and Nvidia often do a lot of overtime.\n\nBut overall, it\u2019s important to remember that different people have different working styles. Some people derive a lot of meaning from their work, so they often don\u2019t see the long hours they spend working as a \u201cbad thing\u201d. This is especially the case with smart researchers you work with at Facebook AI - these are individuals that are at the top of their fields and love to learn.\n\nOur managers do often ask us whether we\u2019re ensuring that we have a good work life balance in place, but we never know how to answer that question because we\u2019re so engaged with our work!\n\n## What is your favorite thing about working as a Research Scientist at Facebook?\n\nMy favorite thing has to do with the impact that I can have. Both the impact for the research community and the impact on the product side are huge - they\u2019re equally exciting. I also don\u2019t want to just join a pure research team because I\u2019ve come to enjoy the production side of our projects as well.\n\nSomething that\u2019s pleasantly surprised me about working at Facebook has been how open the culture is. Your managers are really invested in your personal growth and want to make sure you find your work meaningful. It\u2019s also really common to discuss career paths with your managers so that you\u2019re always headed in the direction you want.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve really enjoyed growing in so many ways outside of research (which was what my background mainly consisted of). You have to work with different people, manage conflict, improve your communication skills, and be a team player. These all areas I\u2019ve grown in tremendously.\n\n\\-------\n\nThat's it, hope it was helpful.

I don't know about #2, but I think #1 maybe be true, because I know a couple of people (SWE and DS mostly) who left, went private, and came back because they discovered that they cared more about reasonable workloads and good PTO than making 30-50% more money &amp; getting bonuses. And honestly, I may too,  but for me it's primarily the location. \n\nI realize the answer is probably \"it really depends on the company and it really depends what part of the government\", but any general takes on this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mxvzwl/do_you_think_there_is_a_stigma_against_us/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "datascience", "result": true, "Selector": "branch", "selectorShort": "branch", "MarkedSent": "do you think there is a stigma against (us) government employees trying to get data science jobs in the private sector? /!/ i work for the government as a data scientist, as my first (and so far only) post-masters job. i like my job, but i don't like where i have to live to do my job at my specific -----> branch !!!  of the government. i may change my mind over time, but i think maybe in two or three years when i have more on my resume, i may go back to the private sector (preferably a big and more stable company, not a startup) so i will be able to go back to where i'm from (which is a big us city for tech and ds so that shouldn't be a problem). however i do hear a fair amount of chatter amongst ds people both inside and outside the government that there is somewhat of a stigma against government employees amongst big tech corps when looking to hire programmers &amp; ds, primarily for two reasons: 1, that gov employees get too used to working exactly 40 hours/week less willing to put up with being pressured/forced to do unpaid overtime frequently, and 2, that gov handles ds and swe very differently than faang/etc and that the skill set is too different. i don't know about #2, but i think #1 maybe be true, because i know a couple of people (swe and ds mostly) who left, went private, and came back because they discovered that they cared more about reasonable workloads and good pto than making 30-50% more money &amp; getting bonuses. and honestly, i may too,  but for me it's primarily the location. \n\ni realize the answer is probably \"it really depends on the company and it really depends what part of the government\", but any general takes on this?", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 18, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mxvzwl/do_you_think_there_is_a_stigma_against_us/',)", "identifyer": 5596676, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "jimkoons", "date": 1628091736000, "content": "Don't know what direction take now concerning my carreer path. /!/ I'm a 33 yo data scientist/engineer/analyst that works for a finance company (debt collection).
