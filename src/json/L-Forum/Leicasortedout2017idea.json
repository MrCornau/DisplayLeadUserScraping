You captured several bullet points worthwhile to discuss, I will reply to a few of them: I see that prices for high end enlargers are rising since 1-2 years - and I am not referring to the old or nearly broken down ones. I refer to large Beseler ones which fit 4x5\" negative size and enlarger lenses as well matching this negative size. There is clearly a demand now - I heard that there is at least one company out there here in the US which specializes to buy these kind of enlargers and ship them over to Europe due to low availability there. This business wouldn't exist if there wasn't any demand. I am teaching in selected areas of photography (at the East Coast of the US), and I have started since last year to include film development and printing from negatives in some of my courses - and I was surprised to see how much interest this captured. Especially younger amateur photographers start shooting with film again and learn the old techniques. This is still a niche of course, but it is a slowly and steadily growing one. I am part of several photography groups - one of them is a fine arts group with a mix of professional and hobbyists. About 20% in this group shoot film including small, medium, and large format. Age-wise, this 20% is a broad mix of people in their 30s to > 60s. But all film shooters do this as a hobby, not as professional photography. All professional photographers which I personally know shoot digital (even online I see that some do weddings now back with film photography to provide something \"special\"). Regarding film, several companies mentioned above announced to make film, but as you said the quantity is very limited at this point. Same did just a week ago a Russian company which was even mentioned on dpreview (also with very small quantity). Nevertheless, it sets a sign - all this wouldn't be done if there is no seen demand in film in the market. Also look at the profitability numbers of Fuji - big part of it was related to their traditional film-based instant camera and regular film business. It is still a long way to go before film gets a lot more profitable, but the industry is in the beginning of a recovery IMO. There is still an excess of film cameras to choose from, especially SLRs can be obtained for fairly low prices. As I said, film is still a niche and likely not profitable enough yet for camera manufacturers to vest in bringing new models out since the photo market in general is struggling. I don't think that prices for M film Leicas go up due to lower availability since they might break down now - most of them can be still fixed. There is clearly higher demand in them which moves prices up for higher end camera gear - best of luck finding now a Leica M6 in EX condition below $1K online. But this was the case over 2 years ago. APUG is still there, only the address changed with the digital merger. But let's be honest - do you think that most readers were actual subscribers? It was a freebie for most participants, so it is tough for the owner of the site to make business from a well run online forum. Still, nothing has changed in its content - you can still opt out of seeing the digital part if you like. I don't find this change a biggie. The enlargers I see for sale or for free aren't broken one. They are not something made in fifties, either. My 4x5 Omega 5D XL is in totally working and clean order costs me ... 100 CAD and nobody wanted it for months before me. Toronto Ryerson University is closing all darkrooms, yet, they are teaching photography, but digitally. Dozen of high end enlargers was dumped on dumpster recently in another Canadian large city at one of the Atlantic province. I'm not part of any photography group. In fourth largest by population area in North America I see less than dozen people per year who are actually using film cameras as me, on streets and events. Prices of film M Leicas are not going up, they are going down and steady for five years. I don't remember M6 to be even close to 1K$ for last five years. It was how M2, M3 where priced, not they are sold well under 1K$ and after CLA. M7 has dripped in price significantly. Only Leica made old lenses prices are going up because of interest in them by digital cameras users and collectors. Leica stopped repairs of some M6 exposure electronics. Some basic parts like diodes are not available anymore. In my area two Leica technicians passed away in 2016, only one left and he is re-fixing my M4-2 since March 2017 and not taking any new repairs. In USA basically three independent people left. One is Ye who if can't fix something complicated sends it to DAG. And then Sherrie with some not so positives reports growing. Yes, SLRs are still for sale. But many of them now needs CLA or repairs. And those are units with up to thousand parts in them. It is not economically viable as business and parts are not available from manufacturers anymore. Russian company is typical internet bias, dpreivew already recognized and deleted it. I know this as insider. It is one Moscow guy who has assess to coating machine and chemicals. Then I was in Moscow for two weeks in late 2016 I wasn't able to buy it from him. The operator of coating machine was sick. I was offered two rolls of his film by another film user, yet, he told me, be aware - coating is reported to have holes. It is one person not for profit afar, he makes very small quantities of film missing anti-halo layer. Sounds like gone for good Polypan F 50, isn't it?

If he quits and three remaining in GTA stores with chemicals on shelfs quits, the only option I'll have is to drive to BH in NY. Or do my own chemicals or ask another film buddy in Moscow. Also one guy show who does film chemicals and ships them to North America. Sounds like plenty of choices --img-- , but it is how niche products are exists.

Also one guy show who does film chemicals and ships them to North America. Sounds like plenty of choices --img-- , but it is how niche products are exists. This is what film has become and this is where film is going to stay. Our opinions differ here, and it might indeed be affected by regional differences in the market. I can only tell from my area here at the US East Coast close to NYC and back in Germany. In Germany the big majority of drugstores still accept and use outside labs to develop submitted film (also B&W!). B&H does not home-deliver liquid chemicals anymore (e.g. stopper solutions) due to liability reasons in the shipping process. Others do - e.g. Freestyle in CA. But I have no trouble getting powder-based packed chemicals like fixer or Hyper Wash from B&H, too. Regarding enlargers, I have seen Beseler 45MXT models going online for $500-1000 in very good condition depending on head type and accessories. Prices on Craigslist went up for these models in the past few years. Regarding Leica M6, you see more common prices in the US market now around $1200 but not below $1K anymore. Also the prices for M7 have not decreased. Servicing of Leica cameras is a big issue in general here in North America. But it seems the few third party repair services make a nice income from it.... In practical terms, I have no limitations getting film and paper for film-based photography (plus chemicals) - even 4x5\" film negatives are offered in a good variety still. Most 35mm film I can get as 100' roll, too. Even if film remains a niche next to digital, it is a lot of fun to keep going with it --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/276485-film-scanners/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-3354690", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "276485-film-scanners", "result": false, "Selector": "[idea, made]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "here is not shostka or svema -----> film !!!  made, either, for years, i have no idea where this scam is coming from on the market.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 100066, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "adan", "date": "2017-01-08 01:26:00", "content": "You can blame it on Leitz's Oskar Barnack. Who had the weird idea of using motion-picture film (35mm with sprocket holes) for still pictures, and making his still pictures (24 x 36mm, aspect ratio 1:1.5 or 2:3) cover the space of TWO motion picture frames ( approx. 18 x 24mm, aspect ratio 1:1.33 or 3:4 - with minor variations). https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/35_mm_Full_Frame.svg/300px-35_mm_Full_Frame.svg.png 35mm's 1:1.5 ratio was a minor format, especially for commercial photography, until the 1960s. By which time the photo paper industry was long-established, and not about to throw out all their existing standards for paper and equipment for just one of many picture shapes. A \"half-5x7\" - 3.5 x 5 inches - was considered completely adequate for drugstore prints from \"miniature\" 35mm negatives. Since then, there have been some industry concessions to the Barnack format - 4x6 and 8x12 machine prints. Me - I print full-frame almost all the time (35mm or 120), with white borders of whatever size. Once the picture is matted and framed, who cares how big the hidden border is? In the darkroom era - 6x9 on 8x10, or 8 x 12 on 11 x 14 or 12 x 18 on 16 x 20 (or 7x7 or 10x10 or 15x15 from 6x6).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/268054-help-me-understand-why-photographic-paper-isnt-115-ratio/?tab=comments#comment-3181365", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "268054-help-me-understand-why-photographic-paper-isnt-115-ratio", "result": false, "Selector": "[idea, making]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "who had the weird idea of using motion-picture -----> film !!!
