For those who like the idea of APS-C, it is worth remembering that Leica only makes two interchangeable lens mounts - the S mount and the M mount. In the past, they have used the M mount for a smaller sensor (the APS-H in the M8), and it is possible they will do so again (though why, when they already have access to a purpose built full frame sensor). I would have thought that generating production numbers of those sensors would be a priority for Leica - the more cameras using the CMOSIS sensor the better for all of us - more product, more support, more innovation. Also, Leica is on record saying they will not produce a new line of lenses (I know they have said a lot in the past, so it has to be taken with a grain of salt). It seems to me that Leica needs to play to its strengths (very fine M lenses and a good full frame sensor that can deal with the register distance of the M mount) - this means they more than anyone can make small lenses and small cameras of very fine quality.

They need to move away from that camera, and the issues it presents from an quality control perspective. What they need to do is to let go of their traditional idea of a camera (keep producing and upgrading the M camera, with the rangefinder), and produce a good quality M mount electronic camera that actually capitalises on what Leica is good at, and has state of the art electronics.

It's so strange that they produce the X2 and X-Vario (which apparently only distinguish themselves with image quality; and that is questionable, depending who you talk to) with APS-C sensors and fixed Leica glass, and the next camera is the M(240) - I'm assuming the M-E is actually out of production (that camera was just an opportunity to use up sensor inventory so they can force the rest of us with CCD sensors to the next iteration of the M(240) when our cameras crap out).

I will reopen this thread in 1-2 years and stick now to DD-X --img--  I just saw this thread for the first time and must say I couldn't agree more with Tobey Bilek's (and others too) posts here: to experiment with film developing when you're starting out is not a very good idea. To master simple basic developing already is quite something to learn. Because you will need to build up experience in printing as well, to realise how it works and how it works best for you. It is only then that you will notice when you've agitated too little, or too much - or when you have not gotten your temperatures right - or when certain photographing conditions deserved a bit stronger development. We all have our own ways, that's fine of course. To me 'experimenting' with developing would mean to shoot test films only. I would never risk important shots. I developped my first film in 1977, in Rodinal. Yesterday I developped my most recent film, in Rodinal (Adox). In between (maybe 3000 films) I never used anything else. I like Rodinal because it is always fresh, so it always works the same providing you always do the same. I guess that means that I find experimenting with film developing never a very good idea, regardless at what point you are in photography. Hmmmm, how conventional.
