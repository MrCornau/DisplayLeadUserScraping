Speaking of Lizars, I have a Lizars of Belfast Falling Plate camera (1890-1910) on its way to me. The camera type interests me because J. M.

His was a Houghton model, I believe. 51 minutes ago, UliWer said: You remind me of my father's camera. He got it as a gift second hand, but was never happy with it. It still has a film in it, as I wanted to try if it still works, but I forgot about it, and too many Leicas were in its way. I should finish the film soon. It has a 1:2.8/5cm Tessar - which I found a rather weak lens (compared to the 1:3.5 version) on the Contax. Perhaps I will look at it less critically with the Super Baldina: --img--  They are a nice enough camera, but probably unnecessarily complicated to operate for such a small camera. With a lot of earlier lenses f3.5 versions were better than the f2.8 or f2 versions. My father\u2019s camera came with an f2.9 Meyer Gorling lens. My Welta Perfekta also has a lovely Meyer Gorling lens. We should not judge the German lenses of the 1930s by \u2018reputation\u2019. A lot of the lesser lenses easily match the Zeiss and Leitz offerings. I have another Super Baldina camera with a Schneider Kreuznach f2 Xenar and it does not produce better images than my father\u2019s camera with its Meyer Gorling.

The main problem would be lenses. Leica doesn't have any experience in medium format (or larger) lenses to cover a true panoramic format, neither I'm guessing any designs ready for production. It would necessitate a brand new lens lineup, at considerable prime premium over M lenses (easily 5k+ per lens). In the current market, I doubt they'd ever recoup the costs of developing the lenses alone, if they sell just a couple dozen per year. Honestly if someone where to make a panoramic camera, it would be Fuji. They have a huge experience in panoramic cameras (Xpan, 617) as well as medium and large format lenses. Also experience building many different camera form factors in medium format. They pretty much built anything under the sun: 6x7 rangefinders, 6x9 rangefinders both fixed lens and interchangeable, 645 rangefinders and AF rangefinders, 6x8 SLRs, bellows cameras, not to mention their panoramic models like the 617 or Xpan (TX). Will they do it? I believe not but I'd like to be pleasantly surprised. For now the easiest route to panoramic seems to be a medium format camera (preferably 6x7 or larger), with an adapter for 35mm film. This is trivial to do with no modifications and $5 in plastic 3D printed parts, if you don't mind unloading the roll in the changing bag once it's finished. Alternatively, a panoramic back. It's a shame that those cost as much as the camera itself due to rarity, but even the exorbitant $300, say for a bronica panoramic back, seems like a steal next to XPan prices. And another route seems to be simple, 3D-printed or CNC'd medium format bodies with large format lenses. A light-tight black box with a transport mechanism and a helicoid, you mount a ubiquitous 90mm super angulon, and you're good to go for 6x12. The main complications in a body is the focusing mechanism and shutter. With a shoe mounted external RF (can be had for $30), and the shutter in the lens, those are solved.
