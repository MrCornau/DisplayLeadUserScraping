I was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. I put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of positions by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so I bit. Shooting Leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and I have shot with every mainline production M I can think of, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M4-2, M4-P, M6, M6TTL, M7, MP, M-A, M8, M8.2, M9P, Monochrom, M-P240, M246, and M262. Still, the screen-less Leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. I have had the chance to shoot my M-D for one day at Universal Studios Hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in Orlando, Florida. During this time, I averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. I shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. I attached the new 35mm/2.0/ASPH/II lens and an E39 UVa and didn\u2019t look back. The camera shoots like an M7. It meters like an M7, focuses like an M7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that I developed with my M7. The big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable ISO dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an M7 without changing rolls of film. Having any speed film from 200-6400 ISO at the twist of a dial is very handy. The rest of the body works like an M7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. All in all, an excellent handling design. O.K., there is one tiny new item I need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. Luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. The shutter sound is discrete like an M should be, very much like the one in the M262, which has the current best M digital shutter. Several aspects of performance warrant discussion. First and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. The default compressed DNG files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. The second area worth note is the metering. The pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cClassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. Metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. The solution is what I term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. You simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. Using this approach, I achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. The slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. The continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. Battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. These numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. I did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and I would up with a dead battery one morning. I would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. The M-D comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. I would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. This is no MP black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the Kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. Other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. It wrote every single image I took to SD card without error, something no other M digital I have owned can claim. It really is that good. If I were to make two changes, I would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current Off/S/C/Timer. I did overachieve and put the camera into Continuous mode when I wanted Single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. Oh, and did I mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital Ms I\u2019ve purchased since 2006? Not a speck of dust! I did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named Kevin who has made a career out of photography. He loves his M\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of Canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. I explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. I caught him chimping the ISO dial a few times, and when I commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and I need to get me one of these (M-D).\u201d Kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and I would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. This, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. The M-D is up to the task. So, who should buy this camera? This is a little bit hard to define. The camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable. It should be durable enough to last for decades. I would expect the batteries and SD cards will be the lifespan-limiting commodities, not the M-D. If you want a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d Leica M digital for still images only, and have at least some skill with M cameras, this is an excellent selection, and could be your only M. If you need to work at the limits of M capabilities, lenses wider than 28 or longer than 90 (subjective), shoot macro, hold cameras overhead or away from your eye for perspective or safety,, shoot at f/0.95, or need to capture short video clips, then a \u2018240 may be a better tool, but don\u2019t forget the lessons the M-D and prior film M cameras teach us.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/261262-a-few-comments-based-upon-two-outings-with-the-leica-m-d-type-262-camera/?tab=comments#comment-3056848", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "positions", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": " leica has created a digital version of their m7 film offering. i was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. i put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of -----> positions !!!

I'd like to share my small experience in lens coding. Now I have only two lenses: CZ C Sonnar 1.5/50 ZM and VM Color-Skopar 35/2.5 PII. Initial preparations took some time. I saw native Leica coded lenses and many DIY codes. Also I read some folks noticed some hand-made codes aren't readable by new cam bodies. So I decided to discover this topic deeply. I have M9 cam with straight reader. As well known M240/M262 have curved form reader. So I started to make drawings based on vector images from manuals and then moved to camera mount photos. I decided they're more real. I analyzed both type reader areas and found optimal point size and position to be read with both shapes of readers. I printed some amount of drawn mount templates on hard photo paper in a digital print service. The template had exact outer radius to fit with Leica and Zeiss lenses and lock mark. It's enough to position the template precisely on lens mount. Template has been cut out and temporary mounted to lens mount with double side stick tape. Then I started to drill slowly and accurate small holes with 1mm bit by fingers. The hard paper allows to avoid bit slipping in the very beginning. Then I removed the template and had noticeable holes. It's possible to continue with 1.5mm bit. During metering I measured an optimal diameter for point as 1.7mm. But 1.5mm bit OK as well due to relatively low diameter precision and a fluctuation during drilling. After I applied electric screw driver at low rotation rate and small drill time of each hole. I finished with 2mm bit in my fingers to make hole edges smooth. Sonnar was the first and very simple task due to it is recommended to code it as lux 50 asph. So it has only 1 left bit hole. That's it. The hole has been filled with black matte paint made by Revell I usually use to paint my railway models. --img--  Another deal was with Color-Skopar. Voigtlaender designers in some reason decided to put screw right at the end of 6-bit code --img--  After that I made a gutter from the screw hole towards mount edge. There's two black points so it is OK to just have fully painted gutter (hasn't show on the photo). Now Skopar is being read as Summarit 35/2.5. --img--  That's all. I still don't know if they will be read correctly with M240/M262 bodies. But I'll test it when I'll reach my buddy with such kind of cam.

Whem you switch on the camera and the SF 24D, independent of order, first the letter \"A\" will flash on the screen of the SF 24D. Then, the only action to take is: Half press the release button. This will initiate the first data transfer between your (and mine) very well-liked XVario and the SF 24D. ...And you will see the results on the back Screen of the SF 24D. Remember: Flash exposure corrections have to be performed on the SF 24D, the corresponding menue on the XVario will not show up. How long should it take? In my earlier attempts, I pressed the shutter halfway for at least long enough for the camera to acquire focus. On most of those attempts, I held it for a few seconds longer. Here's what I tried just now: Fresh batteries in camera and flash Flash set to TTL/GNC mode Press (and hold) shutter halfway. This results in flashing \"A\" on camera display, as previously described. Focus acquired by camera instantly. Hold shutter at halfway position for two minutes and 45 seconds. Display continues to show only the flashing \"A\". After 2:45 minutes, the flash display goes blank, as if it has an auto-off function. Immediately switch the flash to Manual mode, just to make sure the battery hasn't died. Charge indicator lights up and flash fires with shutter. Repeat this entire test; same result. Something is just not working right. I bought the flash used from a seller on FM forum. He's indicated that he'll refund my money if it's really defective. I'm trying to establish that fact, that it's not me overlooking something or that it's not the camera. Leica has not been able to offer any real help. Another thing: there's what appears to be an indicator light, labeled \"o.k.\" to the right of the display panel. What is that for? I've never seen it lit, under any circumstances.
