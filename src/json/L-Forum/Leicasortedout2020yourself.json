There is a very accurate dust detection feature with instructions in your camera's menu. A blower will just blow the dust about, and will do nothing for oil spots or 'attached' dust.

The first step is to purchase some top brand and genuine swabs of the right size (get plenty) and liquid (or use uncontaminated IPA). In my experience, new Leica's need a wet clean early in their life as you seem to get an initial few oil spots that don''t repeat. You can then research and buy genuine products for subsequent 'dry' cleans, such as the gel pad sticks as used by Leica in the factory and 'static' brushes.

The main thing is to not use too much cleaning fluid. First, I use my Giottos Rocket Blaster dust removal blower bulb to any remove loose dust. Next, I use Photographic Solutions Type 3 Sensor Swab (the 24mm wide sensor swabs) and I put three evenly spaced drops of Photographic Solutions Eclipse Optic Cleaning Solution on one edge of the swab, turn it over ans apply two evenly spaced drops to the reverse (other) edge of the swab.

Andy, the solution is to use the FB system.
