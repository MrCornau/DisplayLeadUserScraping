Nowadays we know that , for maximum quality, we need a multi-pass sharpening workflow. If you apply single-pass sharpening you are attempting to account for image source, image content and output process in a single round of sharpening. Mulitipass sharpening takes account of the sometimes contradictory requirements of the different steps in sharpening. To begin with we need a content optimized master image that can be used in further processing to apply creative sharpening and the finally sharpening for specific output. I will take the case for ACR/CS5 because that is what I am used to. Always work at 100% or larger! The object of this capture sharpening is to create an artefact-free ( as far as possible) optimally sharpened file to process further. The image content can be divided in three types: high-frequency images ( think of a landscape with plenty of leafy trees, large amounts of small detail) and low-frequency images ( portraits with smooth skin) and mixed images. The three require different approaches. The main tool here is the radius slider: The higher the frequency, the lower the setting 0.5 to 1.0 Low frequency images require settings between 1.0 and 1.5 That is about the maximum you can use. Typical amount settings would be 15-30 for M9 files, 5-20 for M8 files. The obvious problem is the mixed image. Think eyes and eybrows/hair in that low-frequence portrait.. There are several approaches. 1. Set the radius to 1.0 and try to correct in Photoshop 2. Set for low frequency in sharpening and use the correction brush on areas that need more detail 3. Make two smart objects for different frequencies and blend with a layer mask in Photoshop. You can (in ACR 6.0) create an edge mask using the masking sider. Enlarge to at least 100% and hold the ALT key whilst sliding. You can see where the sharpening will be masked. Then you can bring back detail by using the detail slider in the same way. It is not a simple slider, because it influences a number of parameters. Never mind what it does, the results are quite visible. Then you can switch back and use the clarity slider to enhance your settings. Don't forget you have local control with the adjustment brush. When you are in Photoshop you can sharpen creatively by enhancing areas. You can either use the sharpening brush or make a layer, (over)sharpen it, use a layer mask and play with opacity. In general, always sharpen on a layer, to work non-destructively. There is also the trick of setting USM to a radius of 50 and threshold to 1, using the amount slider for control (normally around 20) to get midtone contrast enhancement to bring out extra detail, but I digress When you have the image to your taste you flatten it and go to output sharpening. For printing you can use your Scott Kelby technique (*) and learn the optimum setting by trial and error or you can delve into the theory and set the sharpening haloes mathematically. The avantage is that you have an optimally sharpened image to start with so you won't have any nasty surprises. (*) Use Unsharp Mask to taste and go to \"fade unsharp mask\" in the edit menu and fade 100% on Luminosity Lightroom works a bit differently, but I do not have the expertise to explain that clearly . LR addition by Marquinius Lightroom works mostly like you describe. When you are used to the ACR (the RAW editor upon opening a photo in photoshop), you'll get used to LR in a jiffy. For sharpening you have the same tools, to be found under DETAIL. What I do (in simple steps): 1) I import a photo in LR with the standard primary sharpening (very low, just to get rid of the softness resulting from RAW). 2) I work the photo until it's \"perfect\" (all conversions, editing, even side stepping to CS, whatever) BUT (and this is important) WITHOUT any further sharpening. 3) I make a virtual duplicate of the edited photo 4) I start my sharpening on this virtual, following the same logic Jaap just described. In this way you always keep the unsharpened image separate from the sharpened ones: printing for screen asks for a different approach the sharpening for print (and for print you can even go to small print/big print, soft paper, toned paper, whatever). You use the unsharpened photo as a starting point. Of course you could make a snapshot and return to that point every time you want to sharpen for a different output, but the you'd overwrite previous efforts. Follow-up question: How do I prepare an image for display on this forum? Answer: My favorite technique is to set the crop tool to 960 px wide (and 640 px high if desired) and crop the full image. Then add Unsharp Mask at maybe a 15-30 amount at radius 1.0 and threshold 0 for a bit of sparkle. Go to Edit, fade Unsharp Mask, choose \"Luminosity\" in the pull-down menu.

This solved my M9 back focusing very quickly and your instructions were very well detailed. Just another helpful tip though it may sound obvious. Do not use the camera display to check image tests, download them to your PC and check. The camera LCD is just not up to snuff to zoom in and calibrate. Brett - --img--  I know this is not for everyone and that's not what I'm saying - my aim in posting is to share the work I have done and the successes I have had with my own adjustments. It is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. It is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. That's all. So Jamie - this is the explanation I posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. As adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. You will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (A) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. A) is the focus throw adjustment. If you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. If you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. As you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. By moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you INCREASE the total available focus throw. By moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you DECREASE the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. Right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. From my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) Infinity is very important. Step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today I've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. Don't accept the nonesense I was spouting before about it not mattering. It really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) Now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. I found text to be excellent. Note whether you now have front focus or back focus. If you have front focus (like I did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. So you need to shorten the arm by loosening (A) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise. (If you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) Now, recheck infinity. It will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. But this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) Repeat step 2. You will see that the focus point has altered. Whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general I made positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) When you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. On my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) I did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. When my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range. I suppose that if this were not the case or if your lenses varied then you'd need to get them recalibrated, or maybe accept a compromise setting. Hope that's helpful.
