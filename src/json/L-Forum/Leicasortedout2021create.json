I don't think in color or B&W when creating an image. I compose for intent and interest then look for objects to support one, the other, or both. I use post editing to either confirm ( save the images), deny (delete the images) that support my original intent/interest and then edit characteristics/objects in the frame to further support my original intent/interest to include the use of color or B&W. If I am lucky, sometimes original intent/interest gets shoved aside when some unintended takes center stage. Most human beings see in some sort of color so the idea of \"seeing\" in B&W seems artificial/forced emotions to me and I don't think I would change any fundamentals of composition if I shot a monochrom vs color camera. OTOH, I'm all for exploring new techniques and different approaches and who knows if one fine day I find an M10M in my hand and I feel forced to think in B&W whatever that phrase means that I read so often.

I've study enough M9 photos to come to a conclusion that the new spec sensor seem to render differently - more modern, up to date, contrasty. So I thought to myself, I can probably just lose out some cash if I can't deal with the corrosions. Turned out that I just can't put down shooting the M9, much more so than the M240 when i first got it! It has all the quirks - dimmer VF, slower shot to shot time, frustrations shooting in dim indoors (choose between motion blur or noise). The shutter didn't bother me, it sounds very old school and I love the discreet mode where it simulate film shutter in two steps - shutter fired, recock shutter. Like people mentioned, the shutter sometimes take few seconds more to recock. The sensor sometimes just give up sucking lights at certain low light condition - it was pretty dark to the eyes anyway but M240 can brighten up the scene just fine. The image quality? Just so good. Shooting with M240 brought the journalist side of me, wanting to document the reality, in relatively fast pace. With the M9 however, it brought out the artistic side of me. I shot the below scene which I normally won't with my M240 - flat afternoon tropical sunlight. The M9 rendered with admirable saturated colors which the M240 will have more \"grey\" mixed into the colors, resulting in \"dirtier\" look. I tried to create a preset or profile for the colors, but in the end I realized there's something special about M9 in terms of the tonality, or the contrast curve of it. It's at the same time flat, and pops. More film like, if you will. The M240 often render more gritty, dirtier look, or more accutance, shaper, whatever. Best of all, I found a few China based sources that will replace the M9 cover glass for cheaper fee - with the caveats of not telling you which glass they used.

After all, one could argue that this whole film is a commentary on Nostalgia. I'm in Owen Wilson's team. I was born in the time of digital, and yet I missed shooting of film, even though I had never shot on film in my life before. For years, like many millennial instagramers, I tried to emulate film. I did everything, from adding a whole lot of grain, to buying presets and plugins. I must say that today, with Nik Collection, I manage to create images that 99% of you could not tell if they were shot on an M3 or an M10R... BUT, I DONT LIKE THE RESULTS. HERE IS WHY. In the process of searching for the film look, there obviously came a time when I bought a film camera. At this point, I realised three things. 1. I realised that the only way to get a real film look is to shoot on film. No digital camera in the world will change this. I can definitely trick people into thinking my digital photo is a film photo, but I myself will always know the truth, and it will never be/feel the same. 2. I realised that I actually much preferred the latitude of digital files, that they had a charm of their own, and that I could push my vision in more directions with digital than with film. That's when I gave up trying to emulate film, and I think it was a total liberation in my photography journey. I embrace the digital look now, and it was a turning point for me to find my style(s). 3. I realised that the pleasure of shooting film is NOT to end up with a final image that is grainy, that has little latitude in post processing, that does not compete with the DR standard of 2021, that constrains me massively at night.... the beauty of film IS SHOOTING FILM. It's picking your stock, loading it into your camera, leaving the house without checking if your battery is full, being limited to a few shots, being forced to slow down and thin, the feeling of cocking the shutter, pressing it and not being able to review your photo. Go home, wait for your rolls to come to life, and feel like you created something from scratch when you see it. This is the beauty of shooting film. The beauty of imperfection. The beauty of slowing things down, and giving them more value. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand why some people like the look of film and have a hard time finding soul in their digital files. It's very different. All I'm saying is that in my case I learned to love both, and it's a great freedom not to try anymore to make the cat a dog and the dog a cat. I love cats and dogs. I have many digital bodies, many film bodies, and I love them all for what they do. It's ok to be nostalgic, but it's also good to give in to the time we live in and embrace it. If you don't believe me, watch Midnight in Paris again.

Different lenses definitely do have a different look - but I agree with you that anthropomorphising one's feelings about those characteristics always ends up being pretty arbitrary (one man's 'clinical' is another man's 'creamy' it would seem!). Clinical certainly is used derogatorily - and I absolutely agree with you that it is the photographer's job to create character, personality and soul.

I prefer shooting in 'raw', so I get to work on the colors as I wish to. I love both the viewfinders - the Fuji viewfinder feels like it's designed better to show me as much information as I wish to see, but the Leica viewfinder shows me all I really need to see. For me, both are just a starting point - the images go through Photo Mechanic, and then into PhotoLab4, and then I adjust as needed. For a simple walkabout camera, I prefer the Fuji. For taking specific photographs, I prefer the Leica. The Fuji seems to guarantee I will get good photos. The Leica allows me to get good photos, if I do my part. The Fuji will improve on the lighting, as needed. The Leica will accept whatever the lighting happens to be, and it's up to me to find a way to improve it if possible. The built-in flash, connected to the computer, is an awesome tool. I doubt if a future Leica M will have something as nice. My Fuji images never really need much more than cropping. My Leica images can be that way too, if I do my part. Everything else being equal, I most often prefer the results from my Leica, even if it does take more care in capturing an image. Fuji is proud of his films. But fuji films were developed for the local market. In Japan, the rich had a white skin color. People working in the field had a darker skin color. Therefore, the white balance on fuji was made using magenta. In the West, skin with a tan was considered a sign of health. Kodak made a white balance using warm tones. I did a comparison of different films with digital fuji. Hundreds of presets. The color of digital fuji is bullshit. I created 100,000 frames of fuji on a 50mm 2.0 lens. Then I attached an old 50mm zuiko lens. The lens is 50 years old. Zuiko won. The creator of Olympus was inspired by a leica. Even the lens schemes are similar. The image of Fuji looks like porridge. A lot of XA. Even in small textures. The picture is flat.

Allow to answer to you point by point where I think it is necessary. 1 hour ago, Harpomatic said: Of all your Instagram posts I can\u2019t see how which equipment you are using makes any difference to the final image other than you enjoying the use of it: all images, including the desert boys shot in what, 2008? have exactly the same post processing that lowers the contrast, almost giving a haze look. I can\u2019t tell if you shot those images on an iPhone or a Hasselblad medium format camera. They all look the same. Which is a strength, you have a visual identity, and can pull it off across equipment. But not once, on your feed, I wondered what it was shot on. Exactly my point. What I buy should upset someone. The only important thing is that it makes me happy. I share my experiences for others who consider to buy the same thing than me, just like I've enjoyed in the past reading experience from others who owned some stuff before me and helped make my decision. Is not that the point of a forum ? To share ? What I cannot stand is when someone tells me I should not buy something because he, without having tried it, believes it is an unnecessary purchase. Only I get to decide what it necessary, and my joy of use is necessary. That being said, some gear helped me in the process of getting to the result I wanted, and even if the end result look different, it has made that process (that only me lives) more enjoyable. I do see a difference in my work from 2008, or the photos I recently posted on my story highlight (check the one called Colombia). It does not matter that it's just me, and not someone else, that sees the difference. I do see it, it makes me happy, and it's all worth it. 1 hour ago, Harpomatic said: Also, no difference between the drone footage and the handheld video footage in image rendering. The drone has no Leica camera or lens on it I assume? Nope. It's just a Hasleblad \ud83e\udd2a 1 hour ago, Harpomatic said: Now, this is just flaunting your affluence. People use these figures as house deposits. Was there a need to tell us that? The price of it? You could have made your point just saying that you bought a very expensive one. But no, you just spent $7.5k on the APO and now $19k on another 35, and you say that in the same post. Why? What does that demonstrate? I think you might have missed the point on my message here, or at least the context in which I said it. When I bought the APO, I created a page that is now 30 pages and that I think some people enjoy. At no point I said, I bought an APO for 7.5K. I just said I bought an APO that I love, and everyone knew the price it costs, but that doesn't matter. Then, someone (who I repeat, has not even tried the lens) comes to tell me that I am over hyping the APO and that it is a useless purchase and that it will not in anyway improve my photography. A debate starts, and people start telling me that I deserved the \"attack\" because I am showing off my gear. I even received a DM from another forum member telling me that it's my fault for showing off that I buy expensive gear. It's a Leica forum, for god's sake !!!!!!! Everything is expensive. I don't go and tell Monochrome owners that they could have avoided spending 9K on a camera, and that they should have bought a Fuji and turn on the BW jpegs !!!! Everyone buys what they want, what they enjoy ! So in this context, I said it was a pity that I now feared of taking about a lens I just bought because it is 19K. The lens in question is a Summilux 35 AA. I've wanted that lens for a while and finally got it. I was going to start an image thread about it, but I know I hesitate, because I fear that the same thing than the APO happens. I never said the price of the APO, yet I got targeted for buying an expensive lens. If I say that I now bought, just a week after a double A, everyone knows that the lens doesnt sell for under 20K anymore. So all I'm saying is that it's a pity I have to hide because someone is expensive and it bothers people. In the times we live in, there is this new concept that money is dirty and shameful. We're not allowed to display wealth anymore, because it offends the people that have less. I find this ridiculous. I am not writing about my APO or my AA to prove to a bunch of internet usernames that I'm rich. I am writing about it because I thought we all shared an interest around a luxury brand. I see people here using their 20k equipment to shoot photos of their 150k Porsches, and it does not seem to bother anyone. Let me tell you one thing. I was not always rich. And when I used to see people buying themselves nice things that they loved, all I wanted was to work harder to do the same one day. It inspired me and motivated me. Sad to see that to some people, in this day and age, it is offending. 1 hour ago, Harpomatic said: Am I envious? No, I admire people like you that have success in life and can get to the point of spending without worry. Well done, again I should learn from you and make a success of myself. If I\u2019m not there is my fault, envy does not get into the equation. But: flaunting your money is plainly a \u201clook at me\u201d attitude. Please respect those people that have different means and still inhabit these forums. Oops, I read a bit too fast. You're saying the same thing than me. Glad to see I'm not the only one. And no, I'm not saying \"look at me\". I'm saying \"Guys, I love my APO, I love my Steel Rim, I love my AA. If you too are considering to buy, here's what I think, here are some photos I made with it, and feel free to ask me anything\". I don't care that you look at me. No one even knows who I am.

You don\u2019t really know who your audience is. But you have a really large one. Actually, I am here and on instagram for two different reasons. The half a million followers on instagram happened without planning it. I came on instagram because it's a great place to show your work to family, friends, and the world. It started like this for me. Before instagram, when I started photography, if I wanted to show my photos to friends, I had to invite them over to my computer, or print a book to show them. To show the world, I had to get into galleries. Well, Instagram is such a great platform to express yourself. I love it and support it. It changed the lives of many artists, in a good way. Not all of the 600k photos I took in my life were meant to be seen by others. Many were just for me, or my family. For memories. Others I am proud of and like to display for others. Nothing wrong with that. I used to receive in average 500 comments in each photo I posted. 450 of these comments were gear related. So decided last month to turn off comments from instagram. I thought people were missing the point to discuss gear on my photos. To me, it was more of a place to constitute a portfolio. I now prefer for people to see my photos, think what they want, but not discuss in public under the photo. It didn't bring anything good, I thought. Here, on a gear forum, I like to discuss gear. There is a place for everything. Gear is not always what matters. But on gear forum, it is, unless it is an image thread. 1 hour ago, Harpomatic said: let\u2019s respect each other and have consideration If the person with who I got in this little argument (sorry I forgot his name) had respected the purchase of my gear and not reduced my opinion to dust, I would have show respect too.

A snippet of my last campaign can be seen below. These gigs are mostly one-man-band endeavours that I really enjoy (often, travelling and tons of hiking involved). In March, I bought the SL2-S for such projects. Why the SL2-S and not a Sony, Canon or Panasonic camera? First, I'm a skin tone aficionado; and I have a clear idea of what sky blue should look like. For me, Arri is the only manufacturer who nails that convincingly. Their price tag is prohibitive, plus there are millions of other reasons why not to carry such a camera with you. Overall, after looking intensively over half a year into the primary Japanese cameras, I ended up with Leica because Leica's take on colours closely matches my idea of colour. Plus, the SL-line feels unbreakable and shows no issues with inclement weather (following my star, I tend to take my gear to unpleasant places without much thinking). Secondly, I needed a zoom lens that renders particularly dimensional images, helping to draw the audience into the video's story. I've worked with Canon's and Nikon's offerings in the 24-70 area. I find that they don't have much of a personality besides being sharp. However, the 24-90 Elmarit SL zoom tics the dimensionality box impressively, showing some character. Still, it sports the usual AF-based, dreadful fly-by-wire focusing that makes manual focussing a woeful experience, albeit the adjustable focus-throw settings help a bit. But after some time, I adjusted to the 24-90's manual focusing and stopped complaining. But why is the focus peaking turned down when the camera isn't rolling but works in its full glory (almost too much) when shooting? That should be fixed in a firmware update. I use Leica's L-log because it offers the broadest dynamic range, leaving no questions. It took me some time to figure out what exactly L-log is. Long story short: L-log is a 10 bit-optimised log curve living in the large HDR Rec 2020 colour space. That's why, without the Rec 709 LUT, the colours are way off in regular SDR HD. But for the best colours and best dynamic range, working in the camera's native colour space Rec 2020 is advisable (could also be ACES). Most NLE support that large colour space; after all, it's the future's video standard. On the footage side, the Sl2-S delivers footage like a little cine camera. The best dynamic range with a subtle texture can be obtained at ISO 800, my go-to ISO setting for almost everything. At ISO 6400, the footage looks still pretty good. In that area, the SL2-S outperforms Arri and any other cine camera I know. Deliberate underexposed by two stops, video sequences with ISO set at 800 can be brought back without any colour shifts and noticeable noise. Four stops underexposed will show some colour shift in the footage and noise. At 6 stops, the video image is grainy, shows pronounced colour shifts and isn't usable anymore. That is pretty remarkable. I've shot this video with the SL2-S, including the stills. A few easy to spot stock scenes are included. As I would do with an Arri Alexa, the exposure factored in the sky's bright highlights: A wish list for the next firmware update: In L-Log, focus peaking when idle as pronounced as when rolling Braw or ProRes Raw recording via HDMI Improved AF-C (in its current state, it's unusable in video mode) When thinking about a future SL3-S, I could imagine this: 6K/4K ProRes 444 and ProRes Raw internally Snappy and harmoniously moving AF-C, mimicking manual focus pulls ACES IDT and a 12 Bit log curve similar to Arri C-Log. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/326478-video-and-stills-sl2-s-as-a-hybrid-camera/?tab=comments#comment-4312074", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "326478-video-and-stills-sl2-s-as-a-hybrid-camera", "result": true, "Selector": "i create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": " from time to time, -----> i !!!  -----> create !!!  social media campaigns on landscape conservation and climate protection. a snippet of my last campaign can be seen below. these gigs are mostly one-man-band endeavours that i really enjoy (often, travelling and tons of hiking involved). in march, i bought the sl2-s for such projects. why the sl2-s and not a sony, canon or panasonic camera? first, i'm a skin tone aficionado; and i have a clear idea of what sky blue should look like. for me, arri is the only manufacturer who nails that convincingly. their price tag is prohibitive, plus there are millions of other reasons why not to carry such a camera with you. overall, after looking intensively over half a year into the primary japanese cameras, i ended up with leica because leica's take on colours closely matches my idea of colour. plus, the sl-line feels unbreakable and shows no issues with inclement weather (following my star, i tend to take my gear to unpleasant places without much thinking). secondly, i needed a zoom lens that renders particularly dimensional images, helping to draw the audience into the video's story. i've worked with canon's and nikon's offerings in the 24-70 area. i find that they don't have much of a personality besides being sharp. however, the 24-90 elmarit sl zoom tics the dimensionality box impressively, showing some character. still, it sports the usual af-based, dreadful fly-by-wire focusing that makes manual focussing a woeful experience, albeit the adjustable focus-throw settings help a bit. but after some time, i adjusted to the 24-90's manual focusing and stopped complaining. but why is the focus peaking turned down when the camera isn't rolling but works in its full glory (almost too much) when shooting? that should be fixed in a firmware update. i use leica's l-log because it offers the broadest dynamic range, leaving no questions. it took me some time to figure out what exactly l-log is. long story short: l-log is a 10 bit-optimised log curve living in the large hdr rec 2020 colour space. that's why, without the rec 709 lut, the colours are way off in regular sdr hd. but for the best colours and best dynamic range, working in the camera's native colour space rec 2020 is advisable (could also be aces). most nle support that large colour space; after all, it's the future's video standard. on the footage side, the sl2-s delivers footage like a little cine camera. the best dynamic range with a subtle texture can be obtained at iso 800, my go-to iso setting for almost everything. at iso 6400, the footage looks still pretty good. in that area, the sl2-s outperforms arri and any other cine camera i know. deliberate underexposed by two stops, video sequences with iso set at 800 can be brought back without any colour shifts and noticeable noise. four stops underexposed will show some colour shift in the footage and noise. at 6 stops, the video image is grainy, shows pronounced colour shifts and isn't usable anymore. that is pretty remarkable. i've shot this video with the sl2-s, including the stills. a few easy to spot stock scenes are included. as i would do with an arri alexa, the exposure factored in the sky's bright highlights: a wish list for the next firmware update: in l-log, focus peaking when idle as pronounced as when rolling braw or prores raw recording via hdmi improved af-c (in its current state, it's unusable in video mode) when thinking about a future sl3-s, i could imagine this: 6k/4k prores 444 and prores raw internally snappy and harmoniously moving af-c, mimicking manual focus pulls aces idt and a 12 bit log curve similar to arri c-log. --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 28375, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Slender", "date": "2021-01-26 08:38:00", "content": "A recapitulation of tips to improve battery life on SL2 I learned and use when on long walks and dont need all bells and whistles on: Use those batteries for a dozen of cycles, and they get better.

As long as you are ok with the size/weight of the SL 24-90 I think you will be very pleased with it as a general purpose lens. I sold it in favor of the primes, but also because at least in my case 2-3 hours was my max with that lens in terms of comfortable carry. With regard to your earlier question about my intentions with SL2 and SL2-s combo. I've just received my SL2-s. It was not an easy decision in that I sold my Q2 (a camera I loved) in order to purchase SL2-s. I intend to keep both SL2's. One of the key factors that led me to adding the SL2-s to SL-2 is so I can use use them independently in their respective areas of strength, or simultaneously in the field when traveling or when shooting landscapes. I often find myself shooting in windy or unseasonable conditions. The last thing one wants to be doing under those conditions is changing lens if one can possibly avoid it. I learned a long time ago when shooting wildlife in Africa, Yellowstone and elsewhere that there is no substitute for having two cameras with different lens mounted and at the ready. During golden hour for example lighting conditions change very fast so fumbling with lens changes is not recommended. Also during long exposures which can involve many minutes including noise reduction, I like to have a second camera so I can be taking different compositions during that narrow window with optimal lighting. Also as you mention having a backup particularly when one is traveling is a high priority. While it may be rare, if anything goes wrong and camera needs to go back to Leica its weeks if not months before one is back in action with that camera. Re TL lens use I'm not using them as much as I anticipated, but that's mostly because I'm not traveling. Since you travel a lot with your wife (love the fact that you're able to do so over extended periods of time) I'd be surprised if you don't find yourself using them very frequently. The lens pair very nicely with SL's in general and the IQ on almost all of the TL lens is excellent. Last but not least I strongly recommend you check out the Sigma I series lens. The Sigma 45mm F2.8 is my absolute favorite city/travel walk around lens. When I'm not shooting landscapes, that lens is permanently attached to my camera. I will be receiving the new 35mm F2 this week and can't wait to put it to good use. I may ultimately sell the 45mm in favor of the faster 35mm ( 35mm & 45mm probably too close to keep both). Thank you for this post it has been very helpful in understanding how you came to make the decision to purchase the SL2-S. I think in some ways it has helped me in clarifying my criteria for making my choice. You like many others on this site are accomplished photographers ( I did take a look at your website, there are some fabulous images there!! )and recognize that different tools are necessary for different jobs. This is especially true as you increase your skills and require more specialized tools ( as you said above ). I am not really coming from that place, I am still pretty early to the game, but working to get there. I think at this time I am interested in trying the SL2 or the SL2s while I am not really going anywhere to see if I will like shooting it more than the A7R4 and prefer the images I create with it. When we are traveling I just use what I have and stick with it till we get home. I do have some concerns about the size and weight of the 24-90. You are probably right that I would not choose to use it for a six hour tour of a city but it might be the perfect lens to leave mounted as we are driving around and something of interest presents itself as it always does. Our camper is large enough that I can carry pretty much anything I want ( within reason ), if you are curious you can checkout our instagram @Moabout. I am not sure about the TL lenses. I really need to investigate the third party full frame solutions. I agree though, at first review they are smaller and lighter and the IQ is very good. I have always been impressed by the 35 1.4 and the 11-23. If I end up with the SL2 I will definitely check them out.

By the way this is one of the reasons that I really love the Leicas, its the people on this forum, their collective wisdom, willingness to question there assumptions and share their experiences. I am not sure I have come to a conclusion yet but I thought I would summarize where I am and what I have learned from you all. I have re-read ( if that is a real word ) your comments regarding the noise of the SL2 in comparison to the A7R4 and have looked more closely at the SL2-S. I have also looked at a lot of the images I have taken with my Sony and for a vast majority of the images, noise is not really the issue. Sure there are a few which are taken towards the end of the day where the noise is an issue but this is by far the minority and I probably could have done a better job in managing the ISO, Aperature and Shutter speed to improve the result. Your comments have forced me to realize that it is me that is the problem not the camera. I am not sure why I focused on this as much as I did, maybe it was all the excitement over the SL2-S. When I think about my path, Fuji XT-2 -> Leica Q -> Leica CL -> Sony A7R4 -> Q2 -> M10P -> M10-R I think I have realized that I just like the look of the photos that I have created with the Leica gear. My wife and I have not traveled for over a year and in that time I have spent a lot more time taking pictures with content that I am less excited about. But, I have found that I love the way my M10 can turn a seemingly everyday object into something that is more, the colors, the depth of the image, etc. Maybe this is all hogwash but that is what I think. I really enjoy shooting the M10 and as I said like what I see coming out of it but it is not flexible enough for me as the only camera I would use when we travel. I really like to have flexibility and speed that a mirrorless camera brings to the table when we are traveling, one minute we may be banging along a dirt road and see something that we want to take a snap of, other times we are taking in the sights, sounds and smells of a new city. I want try the SL2 to see if it can bring the same type of image quality/look as my M10 brings but in a mirrorless/ILC/EVF equipped body. I may have eluded to this in my original post, but it is clearer to me now. it's not about the noise or the megapixels its about creating images when we are traveling that have that look. I don't get the look or the same feeling when I use my Sony, Thats it.... NicholasTs last post help clarify for me that each of the cameras has specific tasks which they do better. At first I thought well obviously, the SL2 is the more general solution, it came first, has higher resolution with the ability to crop, and good dynamic range. The SL2s is the more specialized solution as it excels at Low Light and Video. But , I have read the comments of other SL2S owners, like LocalHero1953, suggest that in fact the SL2S is actually the better all around camera (for him) , faster, better autofocus, cleaner more natural looking images, etc. I guess I could easily make the argument that the SL2 with it higher resolution sensor is really the specialized camera it just happen to come first. This may have be driven by the perceived need to offer a higher resolution sensor like the rest of the manufacturers and provide a really clear reason to upgrade from the SL. First I am sure this is all painfully obvious to a lot of you, and I am sorry to have dragged you through my thinking but I felt obligated to explain where I was as a result of your combined input and effort for which I am grateful. So I am going to noodle on this a little more in order to determine which of the two cameras is the best place to start to replace my A7R4 for general travel photography, for ME.

Adam As others have said, raw files are always converted ... better word: rendered ... to JPEG or TIFF for printing in any form. How are you editing and viewing your CL photographs at present? If you're using Lightroom, either CC or Classic, and viewing them directly on screen, you may not realize it but LR is converting the raw/DNG files to a viewable RGB format for you on the fly. It has to do this in order to display them. When you Export your finished, edited work from LR, it is always output as some RGB format ... PSD, TIFF, or JPEG ... unless you specifically tell it to output a file to DNG or 'original' formats for archive/storage purposes. Thus, there is no \"loss of quality\" when you convert DNG files to JPEG or other export format ... The goal of editing your photos in LR or any other image processing app is to render the DNG raw files into the suitable form and look that you want for display or sharing, or printing, or inclusion into other works for printing and distribution. You edit (render) the DNG files to look the way they ought to look for whatever the display or distribution format is needed. If you want to make a photo book using the Blurb.com \"print on demand\" services, there is in fact a standard module in LR for that which will allow you to edit and complete your book layout using your DNG files just as you have them in Lightroom.

In case you missed it, my article here might help you get the best from your Leica CL https://david2008.photium.com/my-way-with-the-leica Nice user review overall. A minor editorial nit ... Near the top of the article, you wrote: \"The CL incorporated the new Leica L-mount which was first introduced on the Leica.\" That should be \"... Leica T\". It's interesting to hear how others set up their CL for use to suit their needs, expectations, and (presumed) comfortable workflow. I use my CL body rather differently from others, I suspect, in that I do not use any TL or SL lenses on it at all. I bought the CL body-only to allow me a digital, TTL viewing/focusing camera when I sold the SL and my SL lenses. At the time, I was using my M-D typ 262 most of the time. What I didn't realize when I bought it was that the image quality and the versatility of the CL were so good, and that it was enough smaller and lighter, that I would soon sell off the M-D 262 body as well. The CL is now my default \"leicht kamera\" that I naturally grab whenever... I already had/have a full complement of both Leica M and R lenses. My camera is always set up with the Leica M Adapter L fitted and my standard 'walking about' lenses are M-mount (usually a wide, a normal, and a modest tele). When I'm doing more specific things, I switch to my R lenses using the Leica R Adapter M stacked onto the M Adapter L. This gives me access to prime lenses in focal lengths from 10mm up to 360mm, plus macro lenses in 60 and 100mm. I can alternatively stack a Nikon F->M-mount adapter for use with a 600mm reflex mirror lens too, occasionally. Using the camera this way means that I am limited to manual and aperture AE exposure modes and have no auto focusing. That works well for my photography: I've never missed the AF and have only found limited desires on rare occasion for Program and Shutter priority operation. The 'control panel' view added in fw 4.0 release does nothing for me since all the same information is available on screen anyway with the info display active and the center button on the four-way controller hides it if I so desire without needing to give a precious programmable button. I have the FN and dial buttons configured with my most used control options (ISO setting, peaking color, etc) ... normally, I use FN set for Self-Timer and right dial button set for ISO. I wish there was a way to eliminate the control panel view since now I always have to press the MENU button twice to get to things I am actually looking for, which are in my Favorites menu. But that's a small nit. I use the User Profiles a good bit. I created my general personal profile first, with coded Leica M lenses in mind, and then developed the rest of them from that to quickly set up the camera for either a specific lens choice (R lenses or uncoded lenses like the Voigl\u00e4nder 10mm), or for a specific activity (copy work with the Macro-Elmarit-R 60mm, etc). I have the EVF-LCD switch set as an option on the right dial button, but honestly I only rarely change it from Automatic. In the field when shooting, I normally get 500-800 exposures on a charge, way more than I usually make in a session, so changing it for battery consumption reasons is somewhat unimportant to me. I find that I use this facility most when I'm doing things on tripod or copy stand and either want to lock the camera to the LCD or to the EVF so that it is not autoswitching the viewfinder all the time and being an annoyance. ISO setting is my usual choice for the right dial button, I switch it to focus peaking when I'm doing macro/copy/table top work because there are many situations when I need peaking to be either a different color or OFF in those situations. The FN button defaults to the self timer, since a wired remote cannot be fitted and it is often too much of a pain to fire up Leica FOTOs and link the camera just for a remote release for one picture; I use the self timer often for single shots where I don't want to have to try to hold the camera still and jig it into a stable position somehow. In copy work I switch it to control the exposure compensation, or white balance, etc, whatever I find need to control manually more of the time. My biggest issue with the CL as it is today is the same issue I have with any EVF/LCD camera: on a bright sunny day, the EVF or LCD brightness competes both with sunlight and with my 'transitions' darkening eyeglasses. The only workable solution so far has been to always have a floppy wide-brimmed hat available so that the sunglasses lighten up a little and the camera is shaded from the sun, minimizing dazzle. This works remarkably well. And I wish the CL had a remote release socket and accessory wired remote. \ud83d\ude31 Otherwise, I'm very happy with the CL body and have considered buying a second body as backup... I've not really needed a backup yet, though, in three years using the CL a lot. I guess when a good example comes up and I feel a little flush, I'll grab it.

I\u2019ve been shooting digitally for 20+ years and shooting Leicas for 10+, including the fantastic M9M. Recently, tho, I acquired a beautiful 1955 vintage M3 and have been shooting it a bit. In Miami, where I live... What a coincidence. I also live in Miami, and decided a few months back that I was going to start using my M3 again in addition to my M10. I've got an Epson V500 Photo Scanner, which I'm using on an Apple Mac Mini, and since Epson's software doesn't run on the latest MacOS, I switched to VueScan - which I've been learning. I just posted a new thread in this forum yesterday, asking for advice on the VueScan software. https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323709-can-i-store-multiple-recipes-for-vuescan-so-i-dont-need-to-go-through-and-select-all-the-settings-when-i-change-from-scanning-negatives-to-prints/ For processing the negatives, I've been using \"DarkroomAndDigitalFilmDeveloping\", a very professional lab, that used to be on Lincoln Road in Miami Beach. They have a wonderful reputation, and one look around their shop and I knew I could trust them to do a good job. https://darkroomanddigital.com They do professional processing, scanning, printing, mounting, and just about everything - but the rates for developing my film were more than reasonable. They can also scan the film, but I wanted to do this myself, since I already had the Epson and VueScan. Nothing about scanning was obvious - I eventually figured out the VueScan settings, and got good \"TIFF\" images onto my computer where I process them in DxO PhotoLab4. I was satisfied with the results, but I have a lot more to learn. I posted a link to a file I created for my VueScan settings in the post I made earlier today. I need to do a lot more research to find out if those are the optimum settings. With no response to my other thread, I wondered if Leica film users were using different forums, but then I found this thread. Good to know there is some interest here, and maybe a place to get answers. I finished shooting my last roll of film in the M3 this morning, and I'll drop it off for processing Monday afternoon. By the time I get the negatives back, I hope to understand the scanner settings better. For now, I'm just shooting B&W, keeping things simple. Previously, I was shooting on Ilford Delta 100 film, but just ordered a few rolls of Tri-X.

Back then I couldn't afford to be shooting in color, and my one attempt at making a color print was barely passable. I don't think my flat bed scanner would be adequate for creating images like what Ansel Adams created, but he used 4x5 or 8x10 negatives.

Oh well, that's just me. If I were creating images to be printed in a large format, where people might walk up to them from a foot away and view the detail, that would be a very different story.

I've gotten a lot of wonderful information in a different topic here, which was created by someone who is using different equipment. From all the responses there, I think it's better to forget about making a perfect scan, and instead learn the process. Most of my \"instructions\" came from this write-up: https://crawfordphotoschool.com/digital/bw-neg-scanning.php The way I interpret what he is saying, is it is most important to configure the scanner to get as much information as possible from the scan. I think he is saying that I should create a \"flat\" image, with minimal contrast, and the \"blacks\" should not appear black, along with the whites not appearing white. The reason as I understand it, is to avoid \"clipping\" where information from the negative gets lost - as it would in over-exposure or under-exposure. Since ALL the information will be included in my scan, I can then \"bring out\" the desired image in my image processing software. I opened VueScan, and modified my settings to match what he shows in that article, and after reading the explanations that follow, I think I now know the reason for these settings. (I see now that I was making lots of mistakes in the past in my scanner settings - so many mistakes. I thought the scanner settings were intended to get a nice looking image.

I scanned one image to test this. It took much longer to capture the scan than with my old settings, but the image came out looking like the examples on his website. It's now saved as a 124 meg file.

I don't know what you mean by the National Geographic - seems like they went to great pains to get good, high-quality images, and if I remember right, 35mm was excluded for a very long time because it wasn't up to the quality. Advertising of course was fake, along with the claims. Fake or not, it was effective. Parents bought what their kids were attracted to on TV.... and I remember when I got my very first color TV. I went back to the store and bought another, to give to my parents. Color accuracy was the last thing on my mind - quite irrelevant. Things were now in color, and black&white TVs were being replaced. Family holidays and Kodachrome? Not in my world. People went into the store and asked for color film, slide or print. I'm sure you're right that the brilliant, bright colors were appreciated more than washed out pastels would have been. I think I remember asking for \"Kodacolor\" film, but that wasn't for 35mm. I didn't avoid color because of the color - I avoided it because I didn't know how to deal with it in my darkroom. 99% of my shooting was b&w. My one attempt at doing color worked, but it was SO much hassle. Cibachrome if I remember correctly. My parents were happy with b&w of course, as that's what they grew up with. As to a godsend of being able to remove telephone poles growing out of someone's head, yeah, books talked about that, and the photo magazines, but nobody other than me and my brother cared.

I have three generic C1 catalogs: One exclusively for my Leica M10, one for Xiaomi smartphone photos, one for general use. As many of you said, it's useful and fantastic to keep your raw files. It's not the same using an already existed Jpeg for different purposes, or export a new Tif file, or whatever special conditions you want/need. If you exported for example years ago some photos with a horrible sepia look (\ud83d\ude2c), but you still have the DNG's, you can bring back to life your pictures again, giving maybe a more appropriate look according to your needs. An exhibition, an essay. Possibilities are so many once you have the DNG. And it doesn't matter if you are an amateur or Pro. In the doubt, keep. Then decide if necessary. I suggest you keep all the DNG you edit. Especially if your # of digital photos is around 2kish. For example, I have a folder where I keep my daily random photos with my M10 (not events or work). It's about 35GB with 1350 DNG files. It's not bad at all. And I can do whatever I want with my photos. Thanks for the insight to your workflow. I\u2019m still settling into using Capture One, but currently it looks like: 1. Import my DNG files into my C1 catalog (I take so few photos and only for pleasure so no point complicating my life with sessions or multiple catalogs). I don\u2019t shoot JPEG. I import the files into a \u201cwork in progress\u201d folder while I\u2019m culling/working on them. 2. Leave a few days. Go back and look afresh and delete the ones I don\u2019t like or didn\u2019t quite work (most of them!) 3. Edit the remaining files and allocate to folders in the catalog (I organise by theme - eg \u201cLandscape\u201d, \u201cTravel\u201d, \u201cFamily\u201d etc rather than by date shot) 4. Export the few I think are good enough to merit potentially showing to others using a C1 preset to create a JPEG sharpened for screen viewing which goes into a folder on my MacBook Pro for which I\u2019ve set an rule for it to be automatically added to Photos. The remaining edited DNG not converted to JPEG and imported into Photos remain in C1 (for now) - I may delete them later. I\u2019ve not decided what to do about printing - my printer (Canon 9500 Mk2) just died, partly because I haven\u2019t been using it enough. Don\u2019t know whether to replace it, rely on a printing service, or stick with just viewing on screen.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/312468-do-you-delete-your-rawdng-if-not-why-not/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4114149", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "312468-do-you-delete-your-rawdng-if-not-why-not", "result": true, "Selector": "i create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "58 minutes ago, dennis said: my workflow shooting in dng culling w/ photomechanics. the outtakes, bye-bye forever. i just keep all dng (and, of course, jpegs) delivered. if assignment (or work), -----> i !!!  -----> create !!!  and keep a c1 catalog, plus the #ish dng and jpegs. editing w/ capture one and export using jpeg mini plugin. if personal, family, street photography, etc. (not work), i have the same workflow (i keep both files), but they are stored differently. i have three generic c1 catalogs: one exclusively for my leica m10, one for xiaomi smartphone photos, one for general use. as many of you said, it's useful and fantastic to keep your raw files. it's not the same using an already existed jpeg for different purposes, or export a new tif file, or whatever special conditions you want/need. if you exported for example years ago some photos with a horrible sepia look (\ud83d\ude2c), but you still have the dng's, you can bring back to life your pictures again, giving maybe a more appropriate look according to your needs. an exhibition, an essay. possibilities are so many once you have the dng. and it doesn't matter if you are an amateur or pro. in the doubt, keep. then decide if necessary. i suggest you keep all the dng you edit. especially if your # of digital photos is around 2kish. for example, i have a folder where i keep my daily random photos with my m10 (not events or work). it's about 35gb with 1350 dng files. it's not bad at all. and i can do whatever i want with my photos. thanks for the insight to your workflow. i\u2019m still settling into using capture one, but currently it looks like: 1. import my dng files into my c1 catalog (i take so few photos and only for pleasure so no point complicating my life with sessions or multiple catalogs). i don\u2019t shoot jpeg. i import the files into a \u201cwork in progress\u201d folder while i\u2019m culling/working on them. 2. leave a few days. go back and look afresh and delete the ones i don\u2019t like or didn\u2019t quite work (most of them!) 3. edit the remaining files and allocate to folders in the catalog (i organise by theme - eg \u201clandscape\u201d, \u201ctravel\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d etc rather than by date shot) 4. export the few i think are good enough to merit potentially showing to others using a c1 preset to create a jpeg sharpened for screen viewing which goes into a folder on my macbook pro for which i\u2019ve set an rule for it to be automatically added to photos. the remaining edited dng not converted to jpeg and imported into photos remain in c1 (for now) - i may delete them later. i\u2019ve not decided what to do about printing - my printer (canon 9500 mk2) just died, partly because i haven\u2019t been using it enough. don\u2019t know whether to replace it, rely on a printing service, or stick with just viewing on screen.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 110072, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "MikeMyers", "date": "2021-02-09 17:51:00", "content": " If I use the \"Unfollow\" tool in one thread I created, does it also un-follow me for other threads?

But the real question is, can the final result be the same ? I know, I'm not the first one to try to replicate the film look on digital. But that's what this thread is about. Can one copy the film look in a digital file? Will it ever be as satisfying ? @Steven By \"final result,\" are you referring to a photographic print, or to a digital file that will be viewed on a screen? This is JMHO based on my own experience - what I think of as the final result would be a photographic print; I think digital can come close to replicating the look of film but perhaps will not produce the exact same result as film. All is contingent on the level of skill of the person doing the digital processing. I have come to think of film as a medium I would use to create a specific body of work with a specific visual fingerprint. Digital would be my go to for day to day shooting, in the interest of convenience and monetary savings. Film is still a viable medium, but it is much more labor intensive (developing and printing) than digital, and is more costly (film, paper and chemistry to develop both) compared to the production costs of digital (SDHC cards). Of course, film cameras are less costly than top of the line digital cameras that wear any camera maker's name, even when you compare the price of a new Leica MA to that of a new Leica M10-R or M10 Monochrom. When you go looking for a nice used film M, the price gap grows even wider. Again, this is JMHO based on my own experience and viewpoint.

I was surprised to find that the M8's version of the images didn't need much editing, other than my own limitations. All my images needed straightening, and cropping, as the photo in my mind was \"within\" the photo captured by the camera, and I concentrate so much on the part of the image I care about, that the camera sometimes gets tilted. For the image I posted last night, I un-did some of my changes - what you see below is closer to out-of-camera, other than for my two main corrections (straightening, and cropping) and adding a watermark. Also, the more I use the M8.2, the more I enjoy the images it creates. DarkTable seems to bring that out naturally, if I don't mess it up by changing things that don't need changing! Meanwhile back at DarkTable, I will go into their forum (or a training video) and learn if I can create my own \"menu\" of DarkTable tools, including the ones I find I want/need the most. I'm also confused at the DarkTable histogram - after I did the adjustments the way I thought I was supposed to do it, I decided I preferred the camera's captured histogram more. I am very happy about the \"reset\" function - if I don't like what I've been doing, I just go to the \"History List\" and click on the first correction, and I'm able to start all over again. Something else I need to evaluate - I have a choice of importing the images into DarkTable, or editing them where I put them after my import from Photo Mechanic, (with more descriptive folder names and file names). Then, suppose I took 50, or 150 images. Normally I would review them in Photo Mechanic as I ingested them into the computer, and would be left with only 5 to 15 of my bestimages. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for the M8 cameras, as they create tiny jpg images embedded in the raw files. The experts at PhotoMechanic taught me a way to create larger jpg previews, which makes the images easier to review. My improved way to do this, was to use PhotoMechanic to \"ingest\" all the images, then go to the folder where they were stored, and use Apple's tools to review them, using Apple Finder and \"Gallery Mode\". I would then delete the bad photos. Later today, I will see if I can do this in DarkTable, view the images in a large size, and delete the bad images. If I can figure out how to do this, I'll post the information here. If someone here already knows this, please post how to do it. Another project for later today is to look for existing Leica Presets for the M8.2 camera, and perhaps my lenses, and see if I can create a Preset within DarkTable to make those corrections automatic when I open DarkTable. I haven't needed it yet, but I also need to find out how to use DarkTable's noise corrections. If I'm forced to use the M8.2 at higher ISO speeds, I'm sure I'll need this. I'm just starting out, but I already enjoy DarkTable a lot. My choices are DarkTable, Raw Therapee, Lightroom, and Photoshop. I still have my other editors including those I used in the past for the M8 images, but I enjoy the \"flow\" of editing with DarkTable.) Maybe by 2022 I'll be at home with it. --img-- --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/312878-darktable-and-leica-presets/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4323689", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "312878-darktable-and-leica-presets", "result": false, "Selector": "i can create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "meanwhile back at darktable, i will go into their forum (or a training -----> video !!! ) and learn if i can create my own \"menu\" of darktable tools, including the ones i find i want/need the most.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 107805, "year": "2021"}], "name": "Leicasortedout2021create"}
