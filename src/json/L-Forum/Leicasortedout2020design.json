Both made of silicon. CCD's a cheaper to make than CMOS but use more power than CCD and have slower readouts. Early CMOS sensors used a lot of the sensor space for the circuits so pixel size was smaller which means noise was greater (smaller photon wells = less dynamic range). CMOS sensors cost more to design but are less expensive in the long run. For a long time now, when you look at the chip under a microscope, you can see the pixels are edge-to-edge. And with Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors, now even more so. When you buy glass from Schott (and I do), you can specify, within reason, whatever thickness you want. If Leica/Kodak/Truesense/On Semi wanted to by 0.5mm glass, it isn't a problem. And they could have easily added coatings to change the UV and IR response. It's not that big of a deal. Plenty of companies that offer coating services and you can model some pretty complex response curves. And if they had added the coatings, they wouldn't have had the 'corrosion'. Maybe the datasheet specified coatings, but, at least for a lot of cameras, the coatings aren't there. We were the first company that figured out how to re-purpose a consumer camera for vegetation remote sensing by making a filter that passed plant absorption (blue or red light) to one color channel and a plant reflection channel (NIR) to another color channel. Plants reflect the NIR because the longer, lower energy wavelengths don't have enough energy to support photosynthesis. So if you look at how a plant is absorbing and reflecting light, you can determine things like biomass, plant health, etc. We also knew how to measure the camera spectral response so we knew how the RGB channels opened and close in the visible and NIR. It turns out that the red channel is open in the red and stay open throughout the NIR while the blue and green channels don't open up until around 800nm. So we designed a filter that passed visible blue and green light, blocked red light, passed NIR from 680nm to 800nm and then blocked light above 800nm - and that was one filter on one piece of glass. That way, only the red channel saw NIR. Once you had a picture with that information, you could run the picture through a computer program to calculate things like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/313260-sensor-corrosion-analysis-and-fix-merged/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-4046433", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "313260-sensor-corrosion-analysis-and-fix-merged", "result": true, "Selector": "we designed", "selectorShort": "design", "MarkedSent": "r: brian \"ccd's are much more sensitive to ir than a cmos sensor, roughly 10x. \" nope. 100% wrong there. both made of silicon. ccd's a cheaper to make than cmos but use more power than ccd and have slower readouts. early cmos sensors used a lot of the sensor space for the circuits so pixel size was smaller which means noise was greater (smaller photon wells = less dynamic range). cmos sensors cost more to design but are less expensive in the long run. for a long time now, when you look at the chip under a microscope, you can see the pixels are edge-to-edge. and with back side illuminated (bsi) sensors, now even more so. when you buy glass from schott (and i do), you can specify, within reason, whatever thickness you want. if leica/kodak/truesense/on semi wanted to by 0.5mm glass, it isn't a problem. and they could have easily added coatings to change the uv and ir response. it's not that big of a deal. plenty of companies that offer coating services and you can model some pretty complex response curves. and if they had added the coatings, they wouldn't have had the 'corrosion'. maybe the datasheet specified coatings, but, at least for a lot of cameras, the coatings aren't there. we were the first company that figured out how to re-purpose a consumer camera for vegetation remote sensing by making a filter that passed plant absorption (blue or red light) to one color channel and a plant reflection channel (nir) to another color channel. plants reflect the nir because the longer, lower energy wavelengths don't have enough energy to support photosynthesis. so if you look at how a plant is absorbing and reflecting light, you can determine things like biomass, plant health, etc. we also knew how to measure the camera spectral response so we knew how the rgb channels opened and close in the visible and nir. it turns out that the red channel is open in the red and stay open throughout the nir while the blue and green channels don't open up until around 800nm. so -----> we !!!  -----> designed !!!  a filter that passed visible blue and green light, blocked red light, passed nir from 680nm to 800nm and then blocked light above 800nm - and that was one filter on one piece of glass. that way, only the red channel saw nir. once you had a picture with that information, you could run the picture through a computer program to calculate things like ndvi (normalized difference vegetation index).", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30229, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "BrianS", "date": "2020-09-16 00:00:00", "content": " 49 minutes ago, jaapv said: Which would not be a problem - The user would need to use IR cut filters in front of the lens, which is no hardship. The only drawback would be the need to use flat field correction for certain WA lenses. We've used Hot Mirror filters for years, with our M8 and with some lenses on the M9. I have about 12 of them. The M8 drew much criticism over the need for external filters and the IR problem. Leica/ONSEMI avoided this completely by using BG55 glass, which is much more stable environmentally than S8612. The protective coating of the S8612 as used in the M9 did not stand up to the job of preventing corrosion. Dan claims that the Data Sheets published for years, revised a few times- are all wrong- that the M9 sensor's cover glass has no protective coating at all. If that had been the case, as per the S8612 Data Sheet- the corrosion problem would have been much worse than it was. Schott states that unprotected S8612 glass will corrode after a few months. My M9 went 7 years. Dan's article on MaxMax labeling Kodak and Leica as \"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid\" does not identify the glass, which is specified in the Datasheet. The Data Sheet also states that the cover glass is provided by Schott, and the performance of the cover glass in the Data Sheet is from Schott. I believe the Data Sheets from Schott and Kodak/TrueSense/ONSEMI. I work with groups that make custom glass, and make custom sensors. To state that silicon sensors are all the same was just way too much. A couple of years ago one of my coworkers needed to make a low-cost VNIR sensor, I went through the data sheets for a number of CMOS and CCD COTS sensors. The IR had been bred out of the CMOS sensors of the time, Hamamatsu CCD's had 10dB higher sensitivity in the IR. All were Silicon sensors. Same with ONSEMI CCD's without IR absorbing glass, better IR- but the emphasis had been placed on Visible. The spectral response of my DCS200ir is about the same in IR as Visible. Kodak started using Indium Tin Oxide to extend blue response. Once again- follow a technology for 40 years, you pick up some things. I hack lenses, known for converting Sonnars to Leica mount and adjusting Jupiters. That's lens hacking for relaxation.From working in an Optical Research Lab for over 40 years. I'm a Lens Hacker, but had two optical engineers work for me to design the real stuff. Kodak came to us for IR technology back in the 80s. Seemed fair that I give them a call in 2009 and ask for a Monochrome M9. I actually asked for a full-spectrum M9, told them I'd buy 6 of them. It would have been under $50K for all of them. Way cheaper than Sensors Unlimited stuff. The Kodak Engineer told me that had a meeting with Leica coming up, and they would discuss it. Kodak had wanted to do a Monochrome M8 to pick up where the DCS760m had failed- due to a banding problem. Preaching to the choir. Once I got the M Monochrom, I had to get the shim for an F1.5 J-3 and Sonnar within 0.01mm. I have about 20 5cm F1.5 Sonnars and J-3's in my collection. Past 100 lenses in Leica mount now. For the M Monochrom: the shims are optimized for different color filters. Deep color filters shift the focus towards infinity, enough to have to adjust the shim. 0.1mm is far off for a lens. I no longer do lens work- Skyllaney in the UK offers the service professionally. Gone are the days that I'd convert a Sonnar to Leica mount for $25 and left-over parts. Some of those Sonnars that I converted sell for a lot these days. All a clever plan to shoot with and take apart hundreds of lenses.

Worked fine for the \"wet\" stage (once I designed a quick-assembly/quick-breakdown wooden table for the trays, that fit onto a standard bathtub's corners, and another table that would fit over a standard sink/toilet to make another flat workspace for the enlarger). But no space for controlled drying - had to give up using fiber paper. Never could print larger than 11 x 14. But even then, wet-printing was a PITA. Mostly, I gave up B&W altogether and shot color slides.

The \"accessible\" printers and paper for digital prints were pretty much cr*p for the next decade - but I trusted in the future, and now we have fiber-gloss papers, archival inks that match or exceed the lifetime of wet materials, and table-top printers that can produce 16x20s in 1/15th the space of wet trays/racks.
