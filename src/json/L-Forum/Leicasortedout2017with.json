Have you found this to be so? Do you see an ACTUAL change in the picture's artifacts on the back screen as you stop down from wide open? Thanks, Albert --img--  Hello Albert, What I was referring to was the personal problem I have with using the back screen handheld because of my close-up eyesight not being that great. To see the rear screen clearly, I need to hold the camera at almost arm's length. To be able to compose, focus and shoot with the rear screen, I would need to mount the camera on a tripod. Hence the Viso 020 is a better solution for me. However, the Thambar is such an unruly beast in that the flare or glow at wider aperture is often really quite intense and makes focusing and even composition more difficult. I read the instructions for the original Thambar that someone linked here and I think anyone seriously contemplating this lens give it a read. In those instructions, it was pointed out that these problems I am talking about are obviated with the use of a rangefinder camera as you are not looking through the lens. This is a good point, but then again, makes visualizing the effect of the Thambar impossible. I don't remember if they made a short mount to use the Thambar lens head on a PLOOT reflex housing, but perhaps they did. Bottom line, I think I need to spend a lot more time with the lens and the M10 to come up with something workable in how I use the lens. This is one tough lens to get comfortable with in use. Top marks to the OP on his input and images taken with the new Thambar. They have been quite instructive and helpful in my own approach to this most difficult Leica lens. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/279589-thambar-crazy/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-3413790", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "279589-thambar-crazy", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "lik- derleicaman said that you need a tripod to be able to appreciate the optical abberancies on the m10's screen... have you found this to be so? do you see an actual change in the picture's artifacts on the back screen as you stop down from wide open? thanks, albert --img--  hello albert, what i was referring to was the personal problem i have with using the back screen handheld because of my close-up eyesight not being that great. to see the rear screen clearly, i need to hold the camera at almost arm's length. to be able to compose, focus and shoot with the rear screen, i would need to mount the camera on a tripod. hence the viso 020 is a better solution for me. however, the thambar is such an unruly beast in that the flare or glow at wider aperture is often really quite intense and makes focusing and even composition more difficult. i read the instructions for the original thambar that someone linked here and i think anyone seriously contemplating this lens give it a read. in those instructions, it was pointed out that these problems i am talking about are obviated with the use of a rangefinder camera as you are not looking through the lens. this is a good point, but then again, makes visualizing the effect of the thambar impossible. i don't remember if they made a short mount to use the thambar lens head on a ploot reflex housing, but perhaps they did. bottom line, i think i need to spend a lot more time -----> with !!!  the lens and the m10 to -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  something workable in how i use the lens. this is one tough lens to get comfortable with in use. top marks to the op on his input and images taken with the new thambar. they have been quite instructive and helpful in my own approach to this most difficult leica lens. --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 12082, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "NB23", "date": "2017-05-31 17:04:00", "content": "At 2.5 it's already intriguing.

If I am to be serious for one minute, I'll answer you this; First of all, the \"king of bokeh\" is the King of nothing, and especially not bokeh. If it absolutely had to be the king of something, it would be the king of size. Maybe. I would call it the overhyped King. Second of all, aren't you tired of the Leica glass overglorification? I am. Sure, I play the game, often tongue in cheek. But in reality, there is no real optical gain to plain old minolta glass, for example. That's what my 20x24 darkroom prints tell me. Actually, some prints made with an old 28-70mm f2.8 Nikkor zoom are so glorious, one would swear it was shot with Leica. Do you see what I did there? I tricked you. How can one swear it's shot with Leica glass, anyways? It is because of the overhypification. Like if it was automatically better. We could verse into deep philosophy but let's spare us the bullsheet. The fact is that its all an illusion that we nourish and nurture. We want our Leica glass to be better. The fact is that in real life, you'd probably choose my Nikon prints to be the Leica prints, and my Leica prints to be the Nikon prints. And that's because you fed yourself the bullsheet (like most people) that a Leica print must necessarily look better. Now about the 2.4 vs 2.5, yes there was a lot of discussion about it. But it seems that you weren't there. The immediate conclusion was that it was a marketing move. And it was. Because in real life, there is no way a manufacturer can manufacture a 0.1 difference (in absolute terms, not in f-stops terms). And indeed, the lend wasn't changed. So tes, in other words, it was only marketing. In conclusion, all this lens talk is mostly bullshiite. I do not accept stuped terms such as micro contrast, macro contrast, foot print, finger print, and so on. Who created those terms? I can come up with my own expert words that mean absolutely nothing: median-contrast, multi-gamut, dryness of the image, chroma-transition between warm and cool colors, edge dimensionality (i.e. the edge dimensionality of Leica glass is, in average, 1.4 points better than Canon L glass, according to blabla measurements. The edge dimensionality is an advanced method of measuring micro contrast. It is the Micro-contrast of the Micro-contrast itself.). It is maybe my experience of having shot over a few million shots, and having printed over 20,000 prints, or maybe simple common sense, but all this is only blabla. The more I thibk about it the more I am certain: the Leica experience is a fondling experience.

Actually, some prints made with an old 28-70mm f2.8 Nikkor zoom are so glorious, one would swear it was shot with Leica. Do you see what I did there? I tricked you. How can one swear it's shot with Leica glass, anyways? It is because of the overhypification. Like if it was automatically better. We could verse into deep philosophy but let's spare us the bullsheet. The fact is that its all an illusion that we nourish and nurture. We want our Leica glass to be better. The fact is that in real life, you'd probably choose my Nikon prints to be the Leica prints, and my Leica prints to be the Nikon prints. And that's because you fed yourself the bullsheet (like most people) that a Leica print must necessarily look better. Plenty of over-glorification out there in the WWW. Plenty of hype as well. Perhaps we all need to take a chill-pill every now and then --img--  Now about the 2.4 vs 2.5, yes there was a lot of discussion about it. But it seems that you weren't there.The immediate conclusion was that it was a marketing move. And it was. Because in real life, there is no way a manufacturer can manufacture a 0.1 difference (in absolute terms, not in f-stops terms). And indeed, the lend wasn't changed. So tes, in other words, it was only marketing. In conclusion, all this lens talk is mostly bullshiite. I do not accept stuped terms such as micro contrast, macro contrast, foot print, finger print, and so on. Who created those terms? It is about bull-shite as its about marketing and advertising to sell what you don't need. Though I am still teaching and in the studio we still teach 32, 22, 16, 11, 8, 5.6, 4, 2.8, 2, 1.4, 1.2 etc half-stops, third-stops, full-stops et al. Then we relate this back to digital. Same with shutter speeds. I can come up with my own expert words that mean absolutely nothing: median-contrast, multi-gamut, dryness of the image, chroma-transition between warm and cool colors, edge dimensionality (i.e. the edge dimensionality of Leica glass is, in average, 1.4 points better than Canon L glass, according to blabla measurements. The edge dimensionality is an advanced method of measuring micro contrast. It is the Micro-contrast of the Micro-contrast itself.). It is maybe my experience of having shot over a few million shots, and having printed over 20,000 prints, or maybe simple common sense, but all this is only blabla. The more I thibk about it the more I am certain: the Leica experience is a fondling experience. Just like sex: all about fondling and only fondlig. Gotta love this comment. The only thing I'll add is that we still teach - live, breathe, sleep get to your your camera as if your camera was the extension of your eye.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/190811-the-king-of-bokeh-killed-by-its-father/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-3287919", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "190811-the-king-of-bokeh-killed-by-its-father", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": " if i am to be serious for one minute, i'll answer you this; first of all, the \"king of bokeh\" is the king of nothing, and especially not bokeh. if it absolutely had to be the king of something, it would be the king of size. maybe. i would call it the overhyped king. i would agree with this summation, especially the price second of all, aren't you tired of the leica glass overglorification? i am.sure, i play the game, often tongue in cheek. but in reality, there is no real optical gain to plain old minolta glass, for example. that's what my 20x24 darkroom prints tell me. actually, some prints made with an old 28-70mm f2.8 nikkor zoom are so glorious, one would swear it was shot with leica. do you see what i did there? i tricked you. how can one swear it's shot with leica glass, anyways? it is because of the overhypification. like if it was automatically better. we could verse into deep philosophy but let's spare us the bullsheet. the fact is that its all an illusion that we nourish and nurture. we want our leica glass to be better. the fact is that in real life, you'd probably choose my nikon prints to be the leica prints, and my leica prints to be the nikon prints. and that's because you fed yourself the bullsheet (like most people) that a leica print must necessarily look better. plenty of over-glorification out there in the www. plenty of hype as well. perhaps we all need to take a chill-pill every now and then --img--  now about the 2.4 vs 2.5, yes there was a lot of discussion about it. but it seems that you weren't there.the immediate conclusion was that it was a marketing move. and it was. because in real life, there is no way a manufacturer can manufacture a 0.1 difference (in absolute terms, not in f-stops terms). and indeed, the lend wasn't changed. so tes, in other words, it was only marketing. in conclusion, all this lens talk is mostly bullshiite. i do not accept stuped terms such as micro contrast, macro contrast, foot print, finger print, and so on. who created those terms? it is about bull-shite as its about marketing and advertising to sell what you don't need. though i am still teaching and in the studio we still teach 32, 22, 16, 11, 8, 5.6, 4, 2.8, 2, 1.4, 1.2 etc half-stops, third-stops, full-stops et al. then we relate this back to digital. same with shutter speeds. i can -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  my own expert words that mean absolutely nothing: median-contrast, multi-gamut, dryness of the image, chroma-transition between warm and cool colors, edge dimensionality (i.e. the edge dimensionality of leica glass is, in average, 1.4 points better than canon l glass, according to blabla measurements. the edge dimensionality is an advanced method of measuring micro contrast. it is the micro-contrast of the micro-contrast itself.). it is maybe my experience of having shot over a few million shots, and having printed over 20,000 prints, or maybe simple common sense, but all this is only blabla. the more i thibk about it the more i am certain: the leica experience is a fondling experience. just like sex: all about fondling and only fondlig. gotta love this comment. the only thing i'll add is that we still teach - live, breathe, sleep get to your your camera as if your camera was the extension of your eye.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 19806, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "mmradman", "date": "2017-01-20 14:24:00", "content": " We know that some long R lenses can work on Leica S, focus distance is limitation in some instances due to inserted adaptor but also in some cases infinity focus can be achieved - adopted APO Telyt 280mm f4 or other lenses with APO 1.4 extender and LeiCo adaptor http://www.lei-ko.de/fotografie/Fotografie.html I also recall seeing (tried searching without success) either here on LUF or somewhere else on the web (Fred Miranda maybe) R lenses used on MF digital back with pretty coverage, some vignetting using wide like 19 mm and 28 mm but rapidly improving with longer lenses.

The autofocus is preferable for my workflow, because it takes each image in turn within the batch, and continues without user intervention - I'm a lazy scanning person. I'm unhappy that Silverfast simply stops and then subsequently crashes when it first encounters an autofocus problem - I'd rather it failed gracefully: skipping a frame with an informative error message, and then continuing with other frames, so the user could come back to failed frames afterwards, and manually focus if necessary. Usability isn't a strong point of the software. Incidentally, 95% of my photography is color film (almost always Portra 400 these days). Black-and-white scanning hasn't ever been a problem for Vuescan - the 16-bit monochrome files scan in just 3 or 4 minutes. Anyway, I'm trying to get some perspective on this: currently using a high-end scanner and two separate applications for a workflow that really mostly outputs just family photography...
