I'm not necessarily wishing for an OVF that never needs adjustment. Rather, I am looking for a tweak to the current system as I don't want to go full EVF in the M. All I want is the sensor to know when the rangefinder patches align and light up the frame lines red, green, blue, or white when that happens. Then you get best of both worlds. How do you propose Leica do that? The rangefinder patch images are completely independent of each other and not aligned at all - until they pass through the viewfinder (where the are combined) and to your eye - which is the \"sensor\" that determines they are aligned. You can move your eye a mm or so \"off-center\" and the images will dis-align themselves - which shows how critical positioning is. Thus a \"sensor\" to do what your eye does also must be placed directly in the middle of the camera eyepiece to work. Which will mean that looking though the viewfinder, you won't see your subject - you'll just see the sensor. Rough schematic of the M RF/VF - you see the subject (red line) by looking through the eyepiece lens (bottom left) and a split block of glass with a silver \"semi-mirror\" coating diagonally through it. You also see a secondary view of the subject from a different angle (yellow line) reflected from the semi-mirror surface.

Which is exactly how the Leica rangefinder views the world - through two different windows a few inches apart. It simulates just the \"rangefinder patch\" of dual overlapped images in the Leica RF.

Be mentally prepared to pay fair market value for a camera without problems. You may have to be patient to find a clean, problem-free example, but when you do, you know what the fair market price is and will be prepared to pay it. Ebay Completed Listings and collectiblend.com are two good sources for looking at prices. Expect to pay a mid-range price. Buying used can save you money, especially if you are expert in the make and model you seek. Knowing the issues, wear-and-tear items, etc. allows for a thorough inspection and assessment before you buy. Not having this knowledge is setting you up for the occasional, \"buying someone else's problems.\" I don't know if you are part of a local photographic equipment community like here in Los Angeles, but you will label yourself quickly by low-balling your offers.

Apparently some report they've had their M9's for years and still see know signs of corrosion while others had two (and possibly more) replacements of the original type of sensor, and each sensor of theirs showed corrosion. What a M9 showing no corrosion but having the original sensor should sell for, I have no idea and don't want to venture a guess as opinions vary. What I do believe (based on my using more than one M9 and follow the market), is that a M9 with a new non corroding sensor, in most cases will not be selling for $1900 at this point in time, unless its in what KEH refers to as BGN condition and even then will probably cost more. On average, a nice M9 (M-E) with new non corroding sensor in approx. \"9\" excellent condition might be around $2500-2600. A 9+ in Excellent + with new non corroding sensor somewhat more, and a beautiful \"10 condition that perfect, boxed and complete with new non corroding sensor would fetch the most. Depends on how nice a body you seek and of course buying location. Low number of shutter actuations of course play a role in price too. This excludes the M9-P, which will fetch a premium about all these prices. So like any item (lens etc.), condition and completeness will play a role in price , so generalities of lowballing it really doesn't apply in my opinion.

L Nonsense. The only thing you will do is increase the weight and make the rig more unwieldy. Full Frame is a handicap, not an advantage. A good MFT camera with the DG Vario-Elmar 100-400 is fantastic as well, but the CL with a long zoom and handgrip will beat any FF offering in practicality of use and IQ. (The latter if you you use the 90-280 (or 105-280). Forget about tripods. I do use a chest pod (an old Rowi one) It is very handy to keep your camera aimed. If the Safari vehicle is suitable, a bean-bag is handy. Take it empty and fill on location, or use a Polistyrene filling for weight. I am just back from Tanzania - Selous and the only lens I used was a Vario-Elmar-R 105-280. The focal length was ample, the image quality stunning.

My issues using the system were (I suspect) actually with the SL2 camera\u2019s flash implementation. I also have experience in studio work plus location work and have used Broncolor, Bowens, Multiblitz, Elinchrom, in the studio while Canon, Nikon, Metz and Leica/Metz Leica/Nissin, on location. My experience with Nissin is the i40. I am on my third one, not because I think they are wonderful but two stopped working on shots. The third one is still in its box! The build quality is not as good as Canon/Nikon, I am sure you will agree with that and the roter dial on the back can be moved off a setting too easily. I found out the hard way! The i60 seems to be a bigger version of the i40. The Nissin MG10, I have to admit that I have no experience with that flashgun. However it is a hammerhead flashgun so not easy to use with modifiers. But with Leica/Nissin that is it. If I shoot events I need on camera flash which will give me HSS, I would like TTL. Most importantly I need flashguns that are reliable. For me the Nissin is not. The systems I would like to see with 3rd party support for Leica are Godox and Profoto. (By the way, I am not involved/endorsed working for or have any relationship with these manufactures). Look at the range from Godox: 850ii, 860ii plus V1 (with a round head) for on camera flash and these are just the ones with lithium-ion batteries. Plus these flashguns have built in triggers to control off camera strobes. AD200, AD400, AD600, and an about to be released AD1200 for off camera strobes. These are just the battery powered range BUT you have to buy from a retailer for warranty cover not from Amazon or eBay. Profoto: A1X for on camera flash. B10 and B10plus (a small 500 watt second flash), B1X (a bigger 500 watt second flash). Again these are just the battery powered range. BUT a very expensive brand with great backup. So who needs this range of flash. Think a wedding photographer, sports photographer \u2013 not shooting a live sports events, portrait photographers, wildlife photographers. The list is endless so for the SL to be used by pro photographers Leica needs to get the flash implementation sorted out. Canon and Nikon can both use all the above flashguns with HSS and TTL. Sony can also plus they are now market leaders because the have the cameras where Canon and Nikon do not. The SL2 looks like a brilliant camera but for a pro it is crippled by not been able to use the strobes needed for the job. By the way, it is not snobbery to want to use the correct tools for the job.

I think you will find that M lenses under 90mm are going to give significantly worse peripheral performance than on the SL ... and the wider you, the worse it gets. Even the WATE is not completely immune. I tried the following this morning, Voigt 10mm, Voigt 12mm (old version), WATE, MATE, 21/3.4, Zeiss 35/1.4, Apo 50/2, Noct 50/0.95, 75/2, 90/4, wide open (f2 for the Nocti) The Voigt 10mm and 90/4 are perfect and all the rest have varying degrees of often fairly obvious peripheral smearing..... even the Apo 50/2 seems to be affected. On the worst it starts within the outer 1/3 of the frame. The R and SL lenses are unsurprisingly fine ...... I did have initial concerns about the SL 16-35 wide open on the S1R in the periphery ......but I think this was due to slight differences in location of the focal plane and the fact that the increased resolution shows up OOF areas more easily. This may also be a factor in making the problem more obvious on the M lenses. This is from JPG only ..... but I doubt RAW conversions are going to be much better. Peripheral colour casts are not particularly evident although there is vignetting. The only caveat is that it is blowing a gale still and the photos I took in the garden have some subject movement .... but there were enough static elements to be fairly confident in the results. I'm not bothering to post them as I can't be bothered to process/crop/label etc etc. The last time I did this I got in a right old muddle. Bear in mind these are fairly rough and ready quick tests ...... but the fact that appearances of the files is fairly consistent throughout the whole group makes me reasonably confident I am not imagining things. I'll do a selection of tripod based SL 16-35/24-90 based direct comparisons when the weather improves tomorrow. If performance of the 16-35 is not as good as on the SL then the camera is going back. The timed 60sec limit on exposure makes use for landscape a nuisance ..... having to use Bulb, extrapolating the exposure and then manually timing things is hardly 21st century photography. The only definitely compatible remote release is a crappy one like on the SL and equally overpriced. LENR is active up to 60 sec in Leica fashion but can be disabled .... I will have to check what the difference is in terms of image quality. Quite what happens beyond 60 seconds using bulb is unclear ..... . More testing to do.

My phone keeps Bluetooth on all day, in addition to telling the phone network where it can be reached every few minutes, and keeping track of its location. My M10-D can only keep its wifi on for an hour. I think the key to low power networking is smarter software, which has to be on both ends of each connection.

High picture quality made possible by the first LUMIX full-frame mirrorless camera Unprecedented picture quality and high descriptive performance The LUMIX S1R incorporates a new 47.3-megapixel CMOS sensor without LPF (Low Pass Filter) to realize high resolution and descriptive performance. This sensor adopts an aspherical lens for the on- chip micro lens to enhance light condensation. Together with the optimum design to concentrate more incoming light onto the photodiode, it achieves both high resolution and highly efficient light condensation performance. This results in the realization of the industry\u2019s highest level of 47.3-megapixel resolution* in the full-frame mirrorless cameras at high S/N ratio and maximum ISO 25600 high sensitivity. The large amount of digital signals is processed by the new high-speed, high-performance image processor Venus Engine to render images with breathtaking description in both photo and video. * As a Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera, as of February 1, 2019. High image quality, high sensitivity performance The LUMIX S1 employs a 24.2-megapixel CMOS sensor. The new Venus Engine, which is exclusively tuned for the full-frame camera, and its Multipixel Luminance Generation and Intelligent Detail Processing realize natural, high-resolution expression while suppressing color moir\u00e9. Three- dimensional Color Control improves the color reproduction of both bright and shadow areas. This results in natural, true-to-life images from low to high sensitivity. Taking advantage of sufficient light condensation, the LUMIX S1 boasts a wide dynamic range and reproduces sharp images with exceptional clarity. Noise is minimized even when shot at maximum ISO 51200 high sensitivity. It is an ideal camera to use especially in low-light situations. An AR coating applied on the sensor of both LUMIX S1R/S1 minimizes ghost and flare even in backlighting. Combination with the high-quality LUMIX S Series lenses based on the L-Mount further enhances the potential of the camera. Plus, the LUMIX S1R/S1 integrates the Body I.S. (Image Stabilizer) for powerful handshake correction. Panasonic developed an algorithm that precisely calculates shake information acquired not only from a gyrosensor, but also from the image sensor and accelerometer sensor. This enables more accurate shake detection and compensation, making it possible to use a 5.5-stop slower shutter speed*1. Combining the Body I.S. (5-axis) in the camera and the O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) in the LUMIX S Series lens, the 5-axis Dual I.S. 2 compensates for larger movements that were conventionally uncontrollable. Maximizing both O.I.S and B.I.S. is highly beneficial in telephoto shots and in adverse situations, such as in low-light or with one-handed shooting with a 6-stop slower shutter speed*2. The 5- axis Dual I.S. 2 works for both photo and video recording, including 4K. The Body I.S. compensates for camera movement even when other L-Mount lenses without O.I.S. are used. Taking full advantage of its high-resolution sensor, the LUMIX S1R/S1 provides a High Resolution mode that faithfully reproduces precise details to be saved as beautiful, highly realistic RAW images. Eight consecutive images are automatically shot while shifting the sensor using the Body I.S. (Image Stabilizer) mechanism and synthesized into a 187-megapixel equivalent (16,736 x 11,168-pixel) image for LUMIX S1R and 96-megapixel equivalent (12,000 x 8,000-pixel) image for LUMIX S1 by the new Venus Engine, which boasts high-speed signal processing. This mode is suitable for taking natural landscapes or fine arts with delicate details. This magnificently high resolution photo is ideal for landscape photography of stationary subjects using a tripod. However, it can also be used in situations where moving subjects are included in the scene, by switching the sub mode. The HLG*3 Photo mode is a whole new style of photo expression that Panasonic proposes. It provides a wider dynamic range to reproduce light and shadow with more natural contrast. The HLG Photos can also be produced as an HSP file*4 with compressed high-brightness signals in stunning 8K resolution (7,680 x 4,320 in 16:9, with LUMIX S1R) or its full resolution (5,888 x 3,312, in 16:9, with LUMIX S1) in addition to JPEG/RAW files. It excels in the expression of lights, such as sparkling starlight or glaring sunlight. The user can playback these vibrant images on the latest Panasonic HLG-compliant 4KTV via HDMI cable connection or other HLG-compliant devices. It is also ideal for photo presentations by photographers. The high-precision shutter unit offers the highest shutter speed at a maximum 1/8000 second to capture spur-of-the-moment, fast moving subjects and to use a high-speed lens with a fully open aperture even outdoors for impressive defocusing. The external flash can be synchronized with the industry\u2019s fastest shutter speed of a maximum 1/320 second.*5*6 *1 Based on the CIPA standard [Yaw/Pitch direction: focusing distance f=50mm, when S-X50 is used.] *2 Based on the CIPA standard [Yaw/Pitch direction: focusing distance f=200mm, when S-R70200 is used.] *3 \u201cHLG (Hybrid Log Gamma)\u201d is an international standard (ITU-R BT.2100) HDR format. *4 \u201cHSP\u201d is an HDR picture format using HLG format video technology. *5 The guide number decreases when the shutter speed is set to 1/320 of a second. *6 As a Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera, as of February 1, 2019. 2. High-speed, high-precision AF system Panasonic has achieved a high-speed AF with its advanced control technology over the major devices - lens, sensor and imaging engine. The lens and sensor communicate at a maximum 480 fps. Combining the Contrast AF with DFD technology, the LUMIX S1R/S1 realizes an ultra high-speed, high- precision AF of approximately 0.08 sec*1. The LUMIX S1R/S1 also boasts high speed burst shooting at 9 fps (AFS) or 6 fps (AFC). With its high subject tracking performance, the LUMIX S1R/S1 never loses the target subject. As a camera that excels in low-light shooting, the LUMIX S1R/S1 boasts -6EV*2 luminance detection performance with Low Light AF thanks to the higher sensitivity and optimized tuning of the sensor. The face/eye detection technology makes it possible to capture people in crisp focus, the Eye AF even detects the pupil of the eye and precisely focuses on it for impressive portrait shooting. The LUMIX S1R/S1 also incorporates Advanced AI Technology that detects specific subjects - humans and fast-moving animals, including canidae, felidae and birds. The camera keeps tracking these subjects even when they turn their back to the camera. For more continuous burst shooting, 6K PHOTO*3 makes it possible to capture unmissable moments at 30 fps by extracting the frame with the best timing out of a 6K burst file (in 4:3 or 3:2 aspect ratio) to save as an approximate 18-megapixel equivalent high resolution photo. The 4K PHOTO enables 60-fps high-speed captures in approximate 8-megapixel equivalent resolution. In 6K PHOTO /4K PHOTO, three exclusive modes can be chosen from depending on the situation; 6K Burst/4K Burst, 6K Burst (Start/Stop)/4K Burst (Start/Stop) and 6K Pre-burst/4K Pre-burst. Users can choose the most suitable burst shooting mode in addition to the regular consecutive shooting mode in full resolution depending on the situation. *1 11EV, at wide-end with S-R24105 (CIPA) in LVF120 fps setting. *2 At ISO100, F1.4, AFS *3 6K PHOTO\u2019 is a high speed burst shooting function that cuts a still image out of a 4:3 or 3:2 video footage with approx.18-megapixel (approx. 6000 x 3000 effective pixel count) that the 6K image manages. 3. Operability from ingenuity for intuitive control The LVF (Live View Finder) is the key factor for completing the ultra high-speed response of the camera. The LUMIX S1R/S1 has the largest level of Real View Finder which boasts the world\u2019s highest 5,760k-dot resolution.* The 0.78x magnification ratio can be switched to 0.7x or 0.74x according to the shooting situation. Adoption of a high-speed, high-precision OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) for the LVF achieves smooth display at 60 fps/120 fps (switchable) and high-speed response with minimum time lag of less than 0.005 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast for exceptional visibility. With minimum distortion and high optical performance, this Real View Finder provides a natural view as seen with the naked eye. It is always sharp and clear from the center all the way to the corners. The 2,100K-dot high resolution monitor in 3:2 aspect ratio has adopted a triaxial tilt moving element to secure both durability and operational ease. It also has a touch control system. Live View Boost is another practical feature that makes it possible to check the composition even in total darkness by boosting the sensitivity just for live view. It also incorporates a Night mode that provides mild backlighting. It lets the user watch the subject comfortably even right after viewing the monitor while in a dark situation for a long time. The LUMIX S1R/S1 includes a largest-in-class Status LCD on the top, allowing users to check the settings at a glance. To make the camera just like a part of the photographer's body, the LUMIX S1R/S1 provides a firm grip, making it easy to hold for long periods. The control buttons and dials are located based on an ergonomic study to enable the user to concentrate on shooting. The adoption of an 8-directional joystick and refined UI (User Interface) also supports quick operation during shooting. In addition, illuminated buttons can be of help in low-light situations. An operation lock lever prevents unintentional operation, and the user can choose which operation to lock. * As a Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera, as of February 1, 2019. 4. Rugged design, reliability and expandability To be tough enough to withstand heavy field use, the main structure is composed of a magnesium alloy full die-cast front/rear frame.

(optical image stabilizer, 2-axis) in the lumix s series lenses, the dual i.s. 2*3 boasts even more powerful compensates for virtually any types of blur. equipped with a high-resolution real view finder, panasonic corporation 2019 triaxial tilt rear monitor and high performance shutter unit with high durability, the rugged design lumix s1r/s1 provides the professional photographers with high reliability. drawing on the vast expertise of the l-mount alliance with leica camera and sigma, various interchangeable lenses are available for the lumix s series. on the other hand, the lumix pro service*4 has also launched to support professional work globally. as a pioneer of the digital single lens mirrorless camera, panasonic has pursued innovations in technology under the vision of \u201cchanging photography\u201d. crystallizing all these digital and optical technologies, panasonic is committed to introducing an unparalleled full-frame camera system without compromise for professional photographers and videographers. *1 pal area only *2 as a digital single lens mirrorless camera, as of february 1, 2019. *3 5-axis dual i.s.2 can be used with the lens s-r24105 and s-r70200 as of february 1, 2019. *4 service is not available in some countries. 1. high picture quality made possible by the first lumix full-frame mirrorless camera unprecedented picture quality and high descriptive performance the lumix s1r incorporates a new 47.3-megapixel cmos sensor without lpf (low pass filter) to realize high resolution and descriptive performance. this sensor adopts an aspherical lens for the on- chip micro lens to enhance light condensation. together with the optimum design to concentrate more incoming light onto the photodiode, it achieves both high resolution and highly efficient light condensation performance. this results in the realization of the industry\u2019s highest level of 47.3-megapixel resolution* in the full-frame mirrorless cameras at high s/n ratio and maximum iso 25600 high sensitivity. the large amount of digital signals is processed by the new high-speed, high-performance image processor venus engine to render images with breathtaking description in both photo and video. * as a digital single lens mirrorless camera, as of february 1, 2019. high image quality, high sensitivity performance the lumix s1 employs a 24.2-megapixel cmos sensor. the new venus engine, which is exclusively tuned for the full-frame camera, and its multipixel luminance generation and intelligent detail processing realize natural, high-resolution expression while suppressing color moir\u00e9. three- dimensional color control improves the color reproduction of both bright and shadow areas. this results in natural, true-to-life images from low to high sensitivity. taking advantage of sufficient light condensation, the lumix s1 boasts a wide dynamic range and reproduces sharp images with exceptional clarity. noise is minimized even when shot at maximum iso 51200 high sensitivity. it is an ideal camera to use especially in low-light situations. an ar coating applied on the sensor of both lumix s1r/s1 minimizes ghost and flare even in backlighting. combination with the high-quality lumix s series lenses based on the l-mount further enhances the potential of the camera. plus, the lumix s1r/s1 integrates the body i.s. (image stabilizer) for powerful handshake correction. panasonic developed an algorithm that precisely calculates shake information acquired not only from a gyrosensor, but also from the image sensor and accelerometer sensor. this enables more accurate shake detection and compensation, making it possible to use a 5.5-stop slower shutter speed*1. combining the body i.s. (5-axis) in the camera and the o.i.s. (optical image stabilizer, 2-axis) in the lumix s series lens, the 5-axis dual i.s. 2 compensates for larger movements that were conventionally uncontrollable. maximizing both o.i.s and b.i.s. is highly beneficial in telephoto shots and in adverse situations, such as in low-light or with one-handed shooting with a 6-stop slower shutter speed*2. the 5- axis dual i.s. 2 works for both photo and video recording, including 4k. the body i.s. compensates for camera movement even when other l-mount lenses without o.i.s. are used. taking full advantage of its high-resolution sensor, the lumix s1r/s1 provides a high resolution mode that faithfully reproduces precise details to be saved as beautiful, highly realistic raw images. eight consecutive images are automatically shot while shifting the sensor using the body i.s. (image stabilizer) mechanism and synthesized into a 187-megapixel equivalent (16,736 x 11,168-pixel) image for lumix s1r and 96-megapixel equivalent (12,000 x 8,000-pixel) image for lumix s1 by the new venus engine, which boasts high-speed signal processing. this mode is suitable for taking natural landscapes or fine arts with delicate details. this magnificently high resolution photo is ideal for landscape photography of stationary subjects using a tripod. however, it can also be used in situations where moving subjects are included in the scene, by switching the sub mode. the hlg*3 photo mode is a whole new style of photo expression that panasonic proposes. it provides a wider dynamic range to reproduce light and shadow with more natural contrast. the hlg photos can also be produced as an hsp file*4 with compressed high-brightness signals in stunning 8k resolution (7,680 x 4,320 in 16:9, with lumix s1r) or its full resolution (5,888 x 3,312, in 16:9, with lumix s1) in addition to jpeg/raw files. it excels in the expression of lights, such as sparkling starlight or glaring sunlight. the user can playback these vibrant images on the latest panasonic hlg-compliant 4ktv via hdmi cable connection or other hlg-compliant devices. it is also ideal for photo presentations by photographers. the high-precision shutter unit offers the highest shutter speed at a maximum 1/8000 second to capture spur-of-the-moment, fast moving subjects and to use a high-speed lens with a fully open aperture even outdoors for impressive defocusing. the external flash can be synchronized with the industry\u2019s fastest shutter speed of a maximum 1/320 second.*5*6 *1 based on the cipa standard [yaw/pitch direction: focusing distance f=50mm, when s-x50 is used.] *2 based on the cipa standard [yaw/pitch direction: focusing distance f=200mm, when s-r70200 is used.] *3 \u201chlg (hybrid log gamma)\u201d is an international standard (itu-r bt.2100) hdr format. *4 \u201chsp\u201d is an hdr picture format using hlg format video technology. *5 the guide number decreases when the shutter speed is set to 1/320 of a second. *6 as a digital single lens mirrorless camera, as of february 1, 2019. 2. high-speed, high-precision af system panasonic has achieved a high-speed af with its advanced control technology over the major devices - lens, sensor and imaging engine. the lens and sensor communicate at a maximum 480 fps. combining the contrast af with dfd technology, the lumix s1r/s1 realizes an ultra high-speed, high- precision af of approximately 0.08 sec*1. the lumix s1r/s1 also boasts high speed burst shooting at 9 fps (afs) or 6 fps (afc). with its high subject tracking performance, the lumix s1r/s1 never loses the target subject. as a camera that excels in low-light shooting, the lumix s1r/s1 boasts -6ev*2 luminance detection performance with low light af thanks to the higher sensitivity and optimized tuning of the sensor. the face/eye detection technology makes it possible to capture people in crisp focus, the eye af even detects the pupil of the eye and precisely focuses on it for impressive portrait shooting. the lumix s1r/s1 also incorporates advanced ai technology that detects specific subjects - humans and fast-moving animals, including canidae, felidae and birds. the camera keeps tracking these subjects even when they turn their back to the camera. for more continuous burst shooting, 6k photo*3 makes it possible to capture unmissable moments at 30 fps by extracting the frame with the best timing out of a 6k burst file (in 4:3 or 3:2 aspect ratio) to save as an approximate 18-megapixel equivalent high resolution photo. the 4k photo enables 60-fps high-speed captures in approximate 8-megapixel equivalent resolution. in 6k photo /4k photo, three exclusive modes can be chosen from depending on the situation; 6k burst/4k burst, 6k burst (start/stop)/4k burst (start/stop) and 6k pre-burst/4k pre-burst. users can choose the most suitable burst shooting mode in addition to the regular consecutive shooting mode in full resolution depending on the situation. *1 11ev, at wide-end with s-r24105 (cipa) in lvf120 fps setting. *2 at iso100, f1.4, afs *3 6k photo\u2019 is a high speed burst shooting function that cuts a still image out of a 4:3 or 3:2 video footage with approx.18-megapixel (approx. 6000 x 3000 effective pixel count) that the 6k image manages. 3. operability from ingenuity for intuitive control the lvf (live view finder) is the key factor for completing the ultra high-speed response of the camera. the lumix s1r/s1 has the largest level of real view finder which boasts the world\u2019s highest 5,760k-dot resolution.* the 0.78x magnification ratio can be switched to 0.7x or 0.74x according to the shooting situation. adoption of a high-speed, high-precision oled (organic light-emitting diode) for the lvf achieves smooth display at 60 fps/120 fps (switchable) and high-speed response with minimum time lag of less than 0.005 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast for exceptional visibility. with minimum distortion and high optical performance, this real view finder provides a natural view as seen with the naked eye. it is always sharp and clear from the center all the way to the corners. the 2,100k-dot high resolution monitor in 3:2 aspect ratio has adopted a triaxial tilt moving element to secure both durability and operational ease. it also has a touch control system. live view boost is another practical feature that makes it possible to check the composition even in total darkness by boosting the sensitivity just for live view. it also incorporates a night mode that provides mild backlighting. it lets the user watch the subject comfortably even right after viewing the monitor while in a dark situation for a long time. the lumix s1r/s1 includes a largest-in-class status lcd on the top, allowing users to check the settings at a glance. to make the camera just like a part of the photographer's body, the lumix s1r/s1 provides a firm grip, making it easy to hold for long periods. the control buttons and dials are located based on an ergonomic study to enable the user to concentrate on shooting. the adoption of an 8-directional joystick and refined ui (user interface) also supports quick operation during shooting. in addition, illuminated buttons can be of help in low-light situations. an operation lock lever prevents unintentional operation, and the user can choose which operation to lock. * as a digital single lens mirrorless camera, as of february 1, 2019. 4. rugged design, reliability and expandability to be tough enough to withstand heavy field use, the main structure is composed of a magnesium alloy full die-cast front/rear frame. robust construction and a sealing for every joint, dial, and button make the lumix s1r/s1 not only splash resistant* and dust resistant* but also freeze resistant down to -

I initially thought that it was a 3.0 firmware option not to do focus and exposure lock by half pressing the shutter button. Apparently I was still using 2.0 on my old one. Then I realised that some times it worked properly. And then I found out that the shutter button (the inner button, not the ring that turns the camera on/off and selected shooting modes) rotates freely and when it is aligned on specific locations, then something strange happens: If you have half pressed and locked focus/exposure and then decide to fully press the button to take the photo, at the point that the button clicks, for a fraction of a second the contact of the button gets lost, the press gets released and if you still keep pressing it, it then makes contact again and it tries to refocus again.. This has many implications: You can't lock focus and exposure by half pressing the button in auto focus mode. When in manual focus mode some times you press the shutter button and it doesn't take a photo if you instantly release it - or the completely opposite: it takes 2 and 3 photos even when in single shot mode if you keep it pressed for a bit longer (we are always talking about a fraction of a second). This is very frustrating with electronic shutter as there is not a feedback that the photo was taken. I have ended up missing a large amount of shots because of this. And also when in continuous shooting mode, the shots get interrupted and instead of shooting 10-12 photos and stacking them in a single stack, it takes random amount of shots and creates random number of different stacks. It is obviously a mechanical problem and from what I can see something that has happened to other people, not just me. I don't know if I want to go through the nightmare of Leica's engineer expertise again and wait another 4 months just not to have my camera fixed. I will have a chat with my local dealer and I will probably sell it for good.. Issues like these should have been spotted on first place on brand new cameras of such a price before they get in the box. Also the fact that mine is a silver makes me feel that they may not even have a silver shutter button to replace it judging from their response to the previous problem I had...
