I was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. I put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of positions by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so I bit. Shooting Leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and I have shot with every mainline production M I can think of, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M4-2, M4-P, M6, M6TTL, M7, MP, M-A, M8, M8.2, M9P, Monochrom, M-P240, M246, and M262. Still, the screen-less Leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. I have had the chance to shoot my M-D for one day at Universal Studios Hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in Orlando, Florida. During this time, I averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. I shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. I attached the new 35mm/2.0/ASPH/II lens and an E39 UVa and didn\u2019t look back. The camera shoots like an M7. It meters like an M7, focuses like an M7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that I developed with my M7. The big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable ISO dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an M7 without changing rolls of film. Having any speed film from 200-6400 ISO at the twist of a dial is very handy. The rest of the body works like an M7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. All in all, an excellent handling design. O.K., there is one tiny new item I need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. Luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. The shutter sound is discrete like an M should be, very much like the one in the M262, which has the current best M digital shutter. Several aspects of performance warrant discussion. First and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. The default compressed DNG files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. The second area worth note is the metering. The pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cClassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. Metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. The solution is what I term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. You simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. Using this approach, I achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. The slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. The continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. Battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. These numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. I did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and I would up with a dead battery one morning. I would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. The M-D comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. I would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. This is no MP black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the Kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. Other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. It wrote every single image I took to SD card without error, something no other M digital I have owned can claim. It really is that good. If I were to make two changes, I would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current Off/S/C/Timer. I did overachieve and put the camera into Continuous mode when I wanted Single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. Oh, and did I mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital Ms I\u2019ve purchased since 2006? Not a speck of dust! I did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named Kevin who has made a career out of photography. He loves his M\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of Canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. I explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. I caught him chimping the ISO dial a few times, and when I commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and I need to get me one of these (M-D).\u201d Kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and I would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. This, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. The M-D is up to the task. So, who should buy this camera? This is a little bit hard to define. The camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable. It should be durable enough to last for decades. I would expect the batteries and SD cards will be the lifespan-limiting commodities, not the M-D. If you want a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d Leica M digital for still images only, and have at least some skill with M cameras, this is an excellent selection, and could be your only M. If you need to work at the limits of M capabilities, lenses wider than 28 or longer than 90 (subjective), shoot macro, hold cameras overhead or away from your eye for perspective or safety,, shoot at f/0.95, or need to capture short video clips, then a \u2018240 may be a better tool, but don\u2019t forget the lessons the M-D and prior film M cameras teach us.

The camera was set at the lowest speed (I screwed the shutter receiving drum to the weakest spring tension by turning the knob on the top of the camera to the extreme clockwise direction). I think this speed is around 200th of a second with the 8mm slit on the shutter installed in the camera (this was discussed in a prior post). Also the lens iris was set at 10, the most wide open available with the over 100 year old 42mm Micro Summar lens. That means it is set at f4.5.The film is Kodak 100Tmax that I have developed in D76 1:1 for 24 minutes at 20 degrees C. This means that I have pushed the film from 100asa to 400asa. I realize that this increases the grain size but that was the only B/W film I had available and it was also my chance to expand my film processing experience.After the film was dried and cut into strips I scanned it on my Epson Perfection 4870 scanner. I did sharpen the pictures and also spot removed the dust spots and a few scratches on the film. These were the only modifications I did to the negatives in the post process stage of image forming.All photographs were taken hand held. I also did measure the distances carefully and set those distances by using the calibration, in meters, that were on the dummy modified to be a replica UR Leica (this focus check was discussed in another post). I picked 4 photos from the 23 taken in the sitting.The subject of the pictures is a good friend HyeSan and her 9 month old baby Raon (pronounced Rhyon in English).

Years later, I began using digital cameras from Canon, and got back into film during the mid 2000's. Ironically, Lomo cameras were the spur to this return. At the time, a Leica M seemed like a mythical, esoteric artifact, immortal and unchanging as the Sphinx or the Taj Mahal. DSLR's were just too heavy after a while, and buying a Zeiss Ikon in 2008 gave me a taste for what rangefinder shooting could be like. When the M9 was announced, I knew that I had to have this camera. My name went into several waiting lists, but to no avail. If you have a slightly obsessive bent, and when you want something it's like your world revolves around its arrival, you know what I was feeling. When the second round came to Australia in early 2010, I called a few shops with the intention of asking about stock of Zeiss lenses. I wanted to round out my collection in preparation of my nebulous M9. When I called one shop, I enquired about lenses, then asked offhandedly if they had an M9 in the shop. \"Yes.\" \"Yes??? You mean, on the shelf, and not waiting for someone???\" \"Yes, it's in stock now. We've only got one left, everyone else on the list has theirs now.\" I SCREAMED like a little girl being taken to Disneyland for the first time, and was at the shop with a bundle of cash within the hour. It was like the hand of God had given me the most frustrating camera I could have imagined. Being used to matrix metering in DSLR's, nothing prepared me for the centre weighted metering of the M9, so my images were either over or underexposed. Rapid focus was out of the question. But I had just bought the most expensive thing of my life, and I wasn't going to be beaten. I spent hours every day for a month, shooting anything and everything, until I developed the skills and habits that opened this German Ark of the Covenant. Since then, I bought a chrome M7 and several more Zeiss, Voigtlander and Leica lenses including the 50 Summicron, 28 Elmarit and 75 Summarit. My M9 is currently in the repair centre awaiting sensor replacement, and remains my favourite digital camera. --img--  --img--  Edited June 5, 2017 by Archiver", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/242491-your-first-leica-tell-your-story/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-3289357", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "242491-your-first-leica-tell-your-story", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i spent hours every day for a month, shooting anything and everything, until i developed the -----> skills !!!  and habits that opened this german ark of the covenant.", "sortedWord": "skill", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 82166, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "tllabron", "date": "2017-07-11 03:56:00", "content": "You have not lived until you have done large format, or at least 6x9cm medium format. I hope your vision is no worse than mine. Look to a Linhof Super Technika with the added viewfinder. If you use perspective controls then first use rangefinder focus, pop the back open and make small adjustments. A lot of LF users would admit they use minimal, trivial perspective controls. Be happy. Oh, if you like wide-angle look into Silvestri cameras. There are more simple options for MF. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I loved my Linhof Master Technika camera. I carried it once into the mountains to the head waters (beginning waters) of the Colorado River here in the USA, I got stunning pictures. That is when I was younger and could pack the 17 pound Gitzo tripod and my Linhof and 3 lenses with plates and 2 - 6X7 roll backs up the trail. Someone asked earlier about changing film in the field and I had with my a fairly lightweight darkbag that I carried along with me and some boxes of film so if I shot all my film I could reload the plate holders. Years and years ago there were always a variety of darkbags available, but now-a-days you probably could only get one if you knew someone that had one and could talk them out of it. You just have to have a sensitive touch to mark your film box and your storage box to remember which is which when you are performing the job. Just don't do it in a hurry at the last minute when you need it yesterday, because you may make a mistake you will regret. I used my Linhof when I was in Iceland and took pictures of the waterfalls and geysers and the beautiful landscapes and the icelandic horse. The only place I did not take my Linhof Master Technika was on my African Safari. The longest lens I had for my LF was 275mm f/5.6 Rotlar Rodenstock lens so I left it on board ship and took only my two Leica SL bodies and my lenses that included a 400mm Telyt 6.8 lens, which was on my cameras most of the time. Although I did wish I had the Linhof when were arrived at Mount Kilimanjaro National Park and I was not able to record on 4X5 a shot of the mountain and the plain. I was beautiful. There also was some discussions about drums. I had a Beseler motorized base with variable rotation control and a 8X10 Drum and a 16X20 drum for developing prints and also developing my 4X5 negatives and slides. You must be sure to rotate the drums slow enough as to make sure the fluids are contact with the film but fast enough to give you good developments times. A way of finding this technique out is to develop TRI-X film at different speeds. The faster the speeds the courser the grain is the slower the speed the finer the grain is the result. I have to admit that I have no idea if this is what will happen with the newer emulsions being used today beccause I have not developed film in very long time, so take these suggestions with a grain of salt.

Controlling it is difficult - best is to average out the scene with high contrast elements for fairly correct exposure - a bit limited in grey scale - Ilford FP4 in comparison has a much wider grey scale tonal range but is much less contrasty. - very limited in shadow details (probably comes with having the high contrast advantage) I will add later how the P30 film does for silver gelatin printing which I will examine soon. Overall I really like this film so far - it is different than most other B&W films which I have used before and leads to photos reminding me of early 20th century B&W prints but with low grain. Regarding development, it seems quite similar to other low speed B&W films. After I developed my first roll of P30 film, my first thought was that I did something wrong - a lot of blanked out areas on the negative. Turned out that this is a film property with the high contrast (black) areas. More tests with some rolls of the second batch of produced P30 film will follow.

I have yet to experience any visible degradation of negatives due to prolonged use of the developer. What I do notice is that after about 15 or 20 rolls of film the volume of developer in the liter bottle is down by what seems to be as much 40%. From this I assume that the developing process consumes developer. What I do not know is....if this consumption of developer leaves a greater concentration of one or another component of the developer solution in the remaining developer, i.e. results in changing the developer solution.

They were shot using an M3, 50mm Summicron DR, HP5+ @ISO 400, and I used a handheld light meter for each shot. I developed with Ilford DD-X. My biggest worry was getting the film on the Paterson reels, but I practiced with wasted film and it went excellent. I had my notes laid out and checklists. I used the Ilford beginner's guide because I wanted a process that is easy and repeatable. I struggled getting the chemicals at 20C -- had to use a pan of ice to get correct temperature. I used the Massive Developer Chart app on my iPad and used the timer feature. All went well until the alarm went off to pour out the developer and put in the stop bath. After I poured the stop bath I meant to hit the continue button on the iPad but I instead hit RESET. No worries, I followed my notes and just used a timer. After the final rinse and foto flo, I looked at the film and I was thrilled to see images. I hung the film in my bathroom to dry about 2:00. At 3:30 I was on the 'net googling how to dry film faster with a hair dryer but patience finally won and I let them dry overnight. Today at 5:00 AM I cut the film into strips and started to digitize them with an DSLR. I used a light pad for illumination and a film holder that is for a scanner. I used a Nikon D800 with a Nikon 105MM-Macro lens. I mounted the lens on a tripod with the camera above the light pad that laid horrozontally. Focused using live-view, bracketed exposures, and used the timer to reduce camera shake. Getting the film and camera aligned at the proper plan is nearly impossible with this setup. The images clearly show some shots with parts of the frame out of focus.

The deal with the stringent time/temperature requirements in built into the film. It takes a non-infinitesimal amount of time for developer to soak from the surface of the film down to the bottom-most layer (red-light-sensitive, cyan dye), so it will start developing 5-10 seconds later than the top layer. C-41 film manufacturers accound for that delay with film chemistry, so that if you develop exactly 3:15 minutes at exactly 100\u00b0F, the layers come out exactly even, even with a different starting time per layer. I read your posts here above with interests, but your experience with the C-41 process does not fully match my own. I am also doing C-41 at home, and I have now developed > 10 color films with my chemicals since last year. First to clarify - 100F is 37.8 deg C. I never go so low in temperature during the development and BLIX steps. I always do the development with followed BLIX at 40 +/- 1 deg C (102 to 106 F). I use 3:30 minutes for the development and 6:30 minutes for BLIX. I am using the Unicolor C-41 chemicals. IMO it is nearly impossible to keep the temperature as exact and accurate as you described above. There are too many factors involved. My experience is - don't bother too much, as long as you are in the 40 deg C ballpark, you are absolutely fine. Colors turn out very well, there is no smearing or cyan looking whites etc. This works for different color films (for example Kodak Ektar, Porta) which I tested. Before I pour the warm developer into the film tank, I pre-soak the film at about 40 deg C in warm water for 2 minutes to get rid of the colored dye (mostly blue or green) and pre-equilibrate the color film temperature. After I poured in the developer (and the same is true for the BLIX afterwards), I always place my tank in a warm water bath which is around 45 deg C (it needs to be warmer outside to maintain about 40+/-1 deg C inside the tank). I had my color films developed at 39, 40, and 41 deg C at 3:30 minutes, and I never saw any kind of difference here. Possible that the Unicolor pack uses a more flexible developer. For B&W - I tested with Ilford XP2 film - it is very easy. Same procedure, B&W comes out very well. Big advantage here is that you can shoot the XP2 film at different ISO speeds and develop all frames the same with C-41. The higher ISO frames will show up with more contrast, but still okay and usable. Another advantage of XP2 film is its low grain amount if this is desired. With a dedicated high ISO or pushed B&W film, you need to stick to an ISO value throughout the film and adopt development times for all frames accordingly. Ilford XP2 @ ISO 400, developed with C-41. Leica M6, Leica 50/2 lens --img--  Ilford XP2 pushed 2 stops to ISO 1600, developed with same C-41 as above.

Thanks again Preben This sometimes happens especially with thicker Kodak film negatives (never had this problem with thinner Ilford negative films). I use some light weights (wooden cloth clamps) at the end of the hanging film when it is drying. If this is not enough, I cut the film after drying into sections (one section has five frames since my archive foil fits this number of frames in one row). Then I put each section on a clean letter-sized glass plate and add a clean white letter sized paper on top of the film sections. On top of it I put 4-5 heavy books and let it sit there for 2-3 days. The film is fairly flat afterwards and suitable to be used for scanning/digitizing. As pop pointed out earlier, use a film negative holder to fully flatten the negatives before digitizing.
