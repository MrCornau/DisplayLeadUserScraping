I have not had a single problem after getting the AF upgrade on mine. I think the anger is mainly because with this level of failure, the market price for Leica S has become quite bad, meaning escaping from this system is a huge financial loss, and if you decide to be loyal and stick to it, or unable and unwilling to take the loss, you ran the risk of the system went discontinue due to bad reputation and low interest, which at current climate, it is highly likely. And if Leica S is discontinued in the next 2 years or so, you will end up with a dead system with 30~40k USD invested. Sure, you can still use it, but you know it's not going to be able to compete with other offering on the market. You can't expect the S to be treated like an M, I think we are more tolerant to the M and accept M for what it is. Technology develops and if S is unlucky to get the boot, then the loyal S users will be left with an outdated body that will not be updated, and a bunch of good lens they can't adapt to other camera system (not like the R) as the coding for Leica S is locked (easily fix if Leica decide to make it public). Leica will probably make the SL to have more resolution and make that as the S-lens body and stop doing S all together to appease the old S users with 5~ lens in the dry box....

Indeed, my copy of the 50 APO continues to outresolve the middle of the 42 MP center on the A7riii, so it is not limited by adaptation to the Sony body. The corners are softer but my comparison with between the 55/1.8 and the 50/APO was center-to-center. With respect to build quality mentioned by others, I agree that Leica M lens build quality is second to none, and substantially better than Sony\u2019s. I\u2019m optimistic that Leica engineers can come up with a lens analogous to the Sony/Zeiss 55/1.8 that is optically superb, no larger than the Sony, yet has Leica M build quality. I\u2019ll happily accept 1.5x the weight. If Leica can release a set of AF primes over the next 24 months with decently large maximum apertures (1.8-2.4) spanning something like 28-35-50-75-90 focal lengths the rumored CM line will be off to a very strong start. I\u2019m a huge M fan, and M lenses consume the plurality of my disposable income. But I welcome this rumor with hopefulness that it marks not only the beginning of an exciting new line of Leica products, but also bodes well for the ability of my favorite photography company to evolve in a highly competitive industry.

For How Busy They Are, I was not thinking about Kubrick, but, yes, there is that time lapse sequence that is so enigmatic, especially without words, that speaks to the mystery of life passing and remembered, simultaneously. The palimpsest of it all surfaces, again. The challenge was to restate the often stated clich\u00e9: passage of time. The intersection of all of these images brought to life after 36 years of celluloid darkness on the same roll was remarkable for me. Not that it matters, but the little girl is my niece, the older lady is my grandmother, and the tree is on my step-grandfather's land. My niece is now 43, and my grandparents have passed away. Cropping out half of the faces makes the images universal, and even gives the connotation that the little girl and the older lady may be one and the same. The black cat is, well, the black cat, though there is the black-and-white cat next to the ancient tree, the one ageless common denominator between the two images, but that black-and-white cat is absent in the second shot. I like your reading much more, the way that you have excavated the visual layers. And, of course, there is Kubrick; anything that brings him into a conversation deserves applause. The chair in Black Cat Chair I actually shot last week on ADOX: first shot with flare on the roll. I went for the darkness of the open door held open by the black chair, the black rectangle reiterated by the yellow caution rail. The background is a shopping bag, also on ADOX for a little implosion. Thanks, again, for your astute reading and charitable comments.

Although many others will have used similiar setups, I want to share a rather \u201aquick and dirty\u2018 solution that I had to come up with after my negative scanner broke down and had to be sent in for repair, leaving me with quite a few strips of unscanned b&w film (my second scanner is a slide magazine batch scanner that does not work with unmounted film). Not owning a BEOON, I had to come up with an interim solution. It does not use Leica equipment, but I use it exclusively to scan films shot with my Leicas, so that hopefully qualifies this post as partially legitimate --img--  Setup: iPad (poor man\u2018s lighttable), distancing box (aka thick wooden frame), two glass covers from photo frames, reversible tripod, DSLR, macro lens, tethering freeware (Sofortbild). Tethering with self-timer and mirror pre-release is helpful to reduce vibrations, since the Cullmann tripod is not designed for this application and is not as steady as a BEOON or other dedicated copy stands. Adjust camera with mechanical spirit level. Manual focus on film grain with 100% magnification in tethering software. With more time, the setup definitely could be improved upon, but I hope to get my scanner back soon. --img--  Some examples (not for technical testing): https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/257654-black-and-white-image-thread/?p=3463651 https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/257654-black-and-white-image-thread/page-88?do=findComment&comment=3463541 Edited February 19, 2018 by schattenundlicht", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/281978-emergency-%E2%80%9Ediy%E2%80%9C-scanning/?tab=comments#comment-3464650", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "281978-emergency-%E2%80%9Ediy%E2%80%9C-scanning", "result": false, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "although many others will have used similiar setups, i want to share a rather \u201aquick and dirty\u2018 solution that i had to come up with after my negative scanner broke down and had to be sent in for -----> repair !!! , leaving me with quite a few strips of unscanned b&w film (my second scanner is a slide magazine batch scanner that does not work with unmounted film).", "sortedWord": "repair", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 102082, "year": "2018"}], "name": "Leicasortedout2018with"}
