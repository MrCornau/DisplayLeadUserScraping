Most operational features of the GR-D are superior to those on the M8, one being the all-important shutter release. We actually have some suggestions on the current firmware update controversy suggesting that people are getting misexposures because they're pushing the release too quickly and should learn to slow down. Let's not even talk about the inconsistently rough feel of the M8 release. I would also add that the GR-D has none of the software operational bugs of the M8 and that, when Ricoh did make firmware updates, they quickly made the addition of several features requested by photographers. I think I am correct that Leica has not yet implemented a single \"laundry list\" request from this forum. On image quality, the GR-D at ISO 200-400 is very much in the ball park with scanned 35mm Tri-X. That's my standard, and I'm not interested in the M8's ability to \"do medium format.\" All the film Leicas were point and shoot cameras, that's what they were known for and good at, and that's what I want from the M8 too. When I originally made the post, some, including Sean Reid, felt I was suggesting that the M8 shouldn't be used for \"medium format\" style work. That wasn't my point at all. It was that if the M8 was going to sacrifice the alacrity of the film M's to accomplish this new capability, then it was simply not an \"M\" for me. I like the files enough and I am familiar enough with Leicas that I use the M8. But it is only marginally an M camera in the traditional sense. It just looks like one.

The M16C has 256k ROM which is not bad for what it is doing; I haven't researched what the Black Fin and Intel provide. I expect the firmware updating is carried out by the Intel PXA270C which provides the interface to the LCD, command dials and push buttons; that in turn also means the M16C receives it's firmware update across this same interface.

You have a pretty good structure diagram of the camera, based on flattening out all the flex connectors and identifying the major components. I don't know the ethical and legal lines between inspection of what you purchased and \"reverse engineering\" (which is usually a right that you only give up when you sign a EULA, and purchasing a Leica doesn't require that), but it would seem fair to look at the card layouts and flex connector lines and make educated guesses about whether the ADC on the M16 can see the output levels on all 6 voltages and determine shutdown when any level is not safe, or can only see the power system input from the battery plus warning signals derived from its third contact, and has to compute a shutdown decision from these. I see the purpose of this kind of discussion as educating us to make reasonable requests for fixes that can actually be done, and suggestions for improvements that respect the amount of engineering work involved.

What should be the first lens I buy for it? Thanks so much. Enrique, What you have is indeed a post-WWII Leica IIIc. More specifically, a \u2018sharkskin\u2019 IIIc. All screwmount Leicas used vulcanite for body coverings, which was made from tree sap of some trees in Indonesia if I remember correctly. After the war this was difficult to obtain and some early post-war IIIc\u2019s used what is in today\u2019s Leica circles described as sharkskin, due to its rather rough feel to the touch. The IIIc did not come with factory-installed flash synchronisation, your IIIc was modified by an independent mechanic and is flash synchronised (a rather clean installation too!). Before you buy lenses, have the camera checked out; most Leicas of this vintage, particularly if not used for a long time will need servicing. Shutter curtains might be dry, lubricant might have dried out etc. Once you are sure that the camera is OK, start looking for lenses. If you want to keep the camera historically correct, try to find lenses in the 600,000 to 900,000 serial number range. I would probably start with a 3.5/50mm Elmar standard lens, those can be found relatively cheaply. Or, a 2/50mm Summitar could also be an excellent choice. Here is a listing of serial numbers with a corresponding year of production: http://www.forloren.dk/lbf/leica_lens_serial.htm If historical correctness is not important, you can try the many excellent lenses that were made by Canon during the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s. Those are unfortunately, getting rather expensive due to collector demand. Another choice would be the superbly made and in many respect better than the old Leica lenses, available today from Cosina/Voigtlander. The cheapest alternative with surprisingly good image quality would be Russian lenses made for the old Zorki and FED cameras - eBay is full of them.

Like Sean I don't think there is one, but they, at least up to the modern Leica lenses, certainly had a different 'look'. And what rigorus scientific tests ala Puts and Reid did I employ? The 'Hormone' test of course! You see, back in the late 50's I was entrusted to run the old B&W Pako film machine at Pfile's Photo Service, the family business. During each run, the 135 film was always loaded last, as we had to chamois the 135s as they came out in the light before they hit the infrared heating lamps. Over time, I began to notice two things that caused more than average attention to the film. The first was that every once in awhile, there passed some VERY interesting images for a young teenaged male. These were set aside for a little contact and enlarging after all the film was processed. Secondly, some of the 135 films had what could only be described as a different 'look'. In reality, it was simply one of contrast and sharpness differences that separated them. I can recall asking my Dad what was happening here (about the sharpness and contrast of course). His reply was '....they were probably shot with a Leica'. I saved for a few months and promptly purchased a IIIf BD and 50mm ridgid Summicron LTM we had taken in on trade at our retail store. $140 and I was making 85 cents an hour at the time, but Dad was right.

Well, here goes. 1. Shoot lots of photographs. With attitude. Sorry, that is just me. Shoot some more. Take a break and have a beer. Shoot some more. Oh yes, then shoot some more. Just when you think you have got your subject covered, shoot a couple of more variations. What the heck, its digital right? And if its film, so what? Film is cheap compared to your camera. 2. From a philosophical standpoint, I view myself as a photographer first, and darkroom or digital technician second, so I make a very conscious effort to put much more time into shooting than in the darkroom or sitting at my computer doing postprocessing. 3. This means that I immediately download my digital photographs onto an external hard drive that is partitioned (so as to optimize its speed). I make new folders for each year, and sub-folders for each month. Just about everything is placed into the month folders. 4. If I shoot a specific project, it gets its own folder with a name that easily identifies it. All of the images then go into that folder. 5. I don't have enough hours in the day to do all the shooting that I want to do, so after the photographs are archived, I just leave them until I need them. I burn all of the folders onto an archival Mitsui DVD-R disc, then duplicate this disc. I keep one disc at home and one at work. This is my archival protocol, the discs at home are the work discs andd the duplicates at work never see a computer and are pristine. 6. Whenever I need an image or group of images I edit via Bridge in PS2, but will soon change this part of my workflow to Lightroom, because it seems to work a bit better than Aperture. 7. This workflow works really well for me because I don't spend a lot of time with the photos on the computer until I use them, plus it is really, really FAST. I shoot a fairly large volume of photographs on a regular basis, both RAW and Jpegs, so this workflow goes along at a brisk pace. Thanks.
