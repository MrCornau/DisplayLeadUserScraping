New firmware for the Leica M10-P, M10-R, and M10 Monochrom Using computational imaging to correct perspective distortion Wetzlar, January 29, 2021. The new firmware update for the camera models Leica M10-P, M10-R and M10 Monochrom introduces an exciting feature: the Leica Perspective Control function, abbreviated as LPC. Having installed the update, owners of the above-listed cameras are able to activate the Perspective Control function \u2013 which uses the camera\u2019s integrated orientation sensors to recognise whether it is being held in a straight position, or tilted upwards or downwards. On the basis of this information, the function uses computational imaging to automatically correct receding lines \u2013 a common phenomenon that is especially bothersome in architectural photography. The term \u2018computational imaging\u2019 refers to the process of forming images with the aid of in-camera algorithms. An auxiliary frame in the camera\u2019s display shows how the image will be cropped in order to correct the perspective distortion. In the case of images recorded in DNG format, the raw data is stored unchanged while the corrections calculated by Perspective Control are written to the metadata. They are then applied automatically in Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop, or can optionally be discarded. For JPEG format images the correction occurs directly in the camera, and only the corrected image is stored. In comparison to the manual distortion correction that is available as an alternative, Leica Perspective Control offers several advantages. Due to its automated nature, it is faster than the manual process. The ability to bring up an auxiliary frame of the corrected image prior to recording, as well as view corrected JPEG images immediately after they were captured, makes it significantly easier to determine the correct framing and most suitable lens. In addition, given that the corrections are based on the data collected by the camera\u2019s orientation sensors (as opposed to the visible details of the captured image) it is also possible to rectify images that do not contain any straight lines. To begin with, the new Leica Perspective Control function will be available for the camera models Leica M10-P, M10-R and M10 Monochrom.

As expected, I bought 2 LTM to M adapters but no luck. Both cannot match the thread of the lens causing the RF mechanism not work when focusing below 2m. I bought a third one and this time can link to the RF but the focus between RF and live view do not match. Now I am thinking to sell the lens out. Very bad experience on using LTM lens... That's very odd to put it mildly! Something must be badly out of alignment / adjustment. It's possible that the lens has been reassembled incorrectly at some point in its past. As has been mentioned many times previously these adapters have been used by photographers - shooting with LTM on M cameras - for over 65 years so the concept is clearly very sound which suggests that, somehow, there is something very wrong with your set-up. Can you be more specific about how, exactly, the adapters \"cannot match the thread of the lens\"? I've just double-checked with some of my own lenses/adapters and there is only one possible place for the lens and adapter threads to mate-up correctly so it's hardly a complicated undertaking. As you have a Leitz lens and a Leitz adapter there should be absolutely nothing to go wrong - yet in your case it seems something is amiss. We really need to know more about the problem you are facing. Perhaps, as mentioned above, the Summaron has been dismantled and incorrectly reassembled by an inexperienced owner/repairman. Do you have any way of verifying that the Summaron is functioning properly in the first place? Do you have access to a screw-mount camera body? We have heard many tales about old lenses having been put together wrongly after repair as, unlike the rear thread/adapter process, the internal helicoids of some LTM lenses can be put together in the wrong orientation.

How do you regard the improvements of firmware 2.0 especially with regards to focusing accuracy and speed? I also read that firmware 2.0 introduced a special low light live view. Does this help focusing and auto focus in low light situations? Is there a significant difference in the autofocus performance between the CL and SL2-S? If there is how would you describe it? Thank you so much for your feedback! I didn't have too many problems with AF in v1 f/w, but my ownership of it has coincided with Covid and limited opportunities to use it in real world people photography. V2 has brought an improvement, but for me it hasn't been a massive difference, just a useful improvement. I mostly shoot using the iAF mode which uses AFs, AFc as it judges best. Last week was the first drama rehearsal I have shot since getting the SL2-S and I found AF and low light performance excellent. In dim light the EVF showed the scene much brighter than the actual lighting, and I was surprised how easily it locked on to faces. I doubt that I am a representative AF shooter though (is anyone?): I hardly use AFc (except when iAF uses it) and I have no experience of the supposed gods of AF: Sony, Nikon and Canon etc. The SL2-S is much better at AF than the CL although, as I explained, I don't use them in the same scenarios, so my comparison is limited. The CL is more likely to fail to lock on in difficult situations, and it does not have iAF, which I find very useful. I usually set the CL to face recognition, which defaults to multi-field focusing when it can't find a face.

If I can find the option to reset the crosshair to the centre by double tapping the LCD screen I may remove it. Having \"Focusing > Touch AF in EVF\" set to \"On\" makes it much more of a problem if my face touches the screen since it's constantly looking for input. Turning that off lets me shoot vertically in either direction without the focus point refusing to move or moving without me meaning for it to. One thing that really helps for shooting portrait orientation is to turn the camera so that the EVF is at the bottom, which puts the screen of the camera up above your face (provided your hair or hat isn't still touching the screen). I prefer to do this since the \"Touch AF in EVF\" is so handy and fluid to use, at least for right-eyed shooters. It's much easier and faster to scoot the focus point around the screen with my right thumb than it is to use the directional arrows. I wish Leica would give us more \"touch-drag\" options for the EVF like most other mirrorless cameras have, such as the ability to use only one side of the screen or one of the four quadrants, plus the ability to use \"relative\" versus \"absolute\" movement.

I second the post(s) recommending the Q2M \u2013 it's like adding a 4x5 black and white view camera to your bag. And since you already have a great mix of organic-looking film images and medium-resolution digital images, the high-res Q2M would add the most variation to your work. The Q2M also gives you the ability to shoot in low light or with a deep color filter with almost no penalty for using higher ISO. I bought yellow, orange, light red, and dark red filters for my Q2M, but I leave the light red filter glued to the lens since there's almost zero change in IQ even losing those 2.3 stops of light. And the light red filter is very flattering for lighter skin tones just like it is on b&w film. The other advantage to the Q2M is you can crop to 35mm and have an image that is nearly indistinguishable from one shot with a dedicated 35mm lens. I have shots cropped to 50mm from the original Q (Q-P) that look so much like my 50 Lux on the M10-R (minus the resolution) that I would be hard-pressed to tell them apart. My only hesitation in recommending any Q for someone who shoots a lot of portraiture would be due to the heavy distortion correction applied in-camera and baked into the DNG profile. You have to be more careful with subject placement than you would with a better-corrected 28mm lens on an M body. Of course with either, you don't want someone's head near the frame edge, but with the Q, you will see a more exaggerated stretching near the edges.
