I think 36 MP would be great. It may seem counter intuitive, but a higher resolution sensor reduces the possibility of moire as diffraction kicks in earlier and acts as a natural anti-aliasing filter. I would also like to see a better external EVF, but that is somewhat separate from the M11 and I expect will naturally happen. Further reducing lag and blackout would be nice additions as well. I would also love to see continued improvement in the optical viewfinder. The improvements in the M10 are great, but as an eyeglass wearer with astigmatism I would love to see it be even bigger. The M10 looks to be great in responsiveness and speed, small improvements in start up time and waking up from sleep, and increased buffer size (which may be an issue if the resolution is increased) would be welcome too. I'm not sure I want the resolution increase if it slows the camera down. I would not want to see video added as in my view the M cameras are ill suited for video and adding a feature that can't perform at a high level, adds to the weight and complexity of the camera, and can be done so much better by other cameras even from the same manufacturer (see the SL) doesn't make much sense to me. Said another way adding video doesn't make any more sense to me than adding autofocus. Both are out of place on an M camera, IMO. I also wouldn't want to see the electronic level added back to the camera. It is a small thing, but the device that is required to make it work (at least if I understand it correctly) would add some weight back and although I have had cameras with this feature I literally have never used it. If I care about precise leveling, then I use a tripod and then I use an actual level with liquid and bubbles, which is far superior in my view as you can check leveling both horizontally and in terms of tilt, it is very easy to read, and it costs less than $20 bucks. Better yet you can remove it and leave it home if you know you won't need it. I don't need a level built into my camera.

Hang on. I said that with respect to the development of a hypothetical QL camera (cracking idea I reckon). Not for future M cameras (which must, absolutely be based around a rangefinder). Just that if you're going to produce an EVF based camera then it would be silly not to use the SL mount (and all it offers) You started well, then went backwards I know I have advocated for an EVF based camera many times in the past (you will recall our discussion about the SL), but that's not because I love the EVF. I love the plain and clear view of the M OVF, but hate its shortcomings inherent in a 1953 design (fixed patch, inaccurate framing, loss in accuracy as focal length increases etc), I love a good SLR viewfinder (the S is amazing), but don't want a mirror box and the lenses and everything that goes with that, and good as the EVF in the SL is, an optical viewfinder is just better. The SL EVF is good enough, but ... The problem I have with the L mount on such a camera is your last bit \"it would be silly not to use the L mount (and all it offers)\". It's the \"all it offers\" bit that I don't like. It's reminiscent of the M(240) when it was released, and part of the underlying reason I wouldn't buy it, but I would buy the M10. I want the limitations of the M lenses, but not the limitations of the coupled rangefinder - I see the lens limitations as a benefit (hard to justify, I know), and I see no benefit in focus and recompose, vague frame lines, hit and miss focussing longer than 50mm, calibration going out and having to add a second viewfinder. The L mount brings the possibility of AF, using TL (cropped), SL (huge) & S lenses (along with other manufacturers), video and all sorts of electronic wizardry irrelevant to using M lenses. It would be a small SL, and would not have the clarity of purpose of the M camera. That is one of the reasons why I thumb my nose at those who keep saying - if it ain't a coupled rangefinder, it isn't an M camera - who cares what it's called? The point I make so badly it seems is that there is a place for an M camera beyond the limitations inherent in the current, state of the art, but still flawed, optical view finder. Call it what you like, but I would like it to be dedicated to M lenses, and therefore limited by the M mount - why? There are 60 years of M mount lenses out there, and more LTM mount. We don't need the platform to also work with L mount lenses. Without such a camera, we are limited to the crf mechanism, and a clip-on EVF. This seems a very big missed opportunity to me. Part of that equation will obviously be that the M10 (or an upgrade to it) will always be available. Pop is right - Leica has been very explicit about that. I don't think Leica needs a small SL - it already has the TL.

They chose a battery of some description for the M8, possibly because it was the largest they could fit into that form factor, but the decision could have been just as soon based on pricing, money being in short supply at the time. They then ran into problems with the weak power supply with the faster and more power hungry M9, resulting in striped pictures and needing much tweaking of the software without actually solving the problem. For the M (Typ 240) they chose a battery with much larger capacity and - above all - with the capability of delivering larger currents, in order to avoid the problems introduced in the M9. However, the lovely large-capacity battery of the M would not fit into the slimmer M10 and returning to the weak battery of the M8 and M9 was not an option. So there you are. Of course, but that's not the point. The point I was making is just that - zero regard for the fact that every camera has a different battery and charger. Does it matter? That is another question. To me, it does. Whole of life cost, and whole of life environmental impact, is something Leica has studiously ignored. 30 years ago, my VW Golf was manufactured with those costs and recycling in mind. Meanwhile, Leica makes the bodies for the M cameras simply because that is the way they have always been made - zinc topdecks didn't go down so well with Leica cognisenti. Yet, it seems when it comes to the electronics parts bin, Leica is less diligent. We now understand that a digital camera is only as good as its weakest link (M8 LCD, M9 sensor, M what? EVF?). My beef is when I go out with any Leica, some will observe it cost as much as a small family car, and it's true. We all pay over the odds for what we want in Leica, and we love it. We love it so much that we trade perfectly good cameras because the whole buying pleasure and discovering new features is far more enjoyable than making the most of what we have. When I make this complaint, I'm told the Leica strapline \"camera for life\" is just marketing, you'd be stupid to believe it, it's a computer not a camera, it's a consumer product, electronics don't last that long etc etc Well, at this price point, with lenses and every part of the camera (apart from the electronics) built to last more than a lifetime, I'd say bullshit to that. Take the M9; many people happy with that. The camera cost me $10,000. I looked after it; like Jaap I paid for the M9P upgrade, and I added the Monochrom - very happy. But, the sensor failed. Yes, Leica has offered a solution (not without considerable pressure here - they denied the problem first). Pop says, blithely, the power supply for the M9 was weak, resulting in striped pictures, etc. Leica's solution? Rather than fix that through improved battery technology, release a new camera - and once a new camera is released, they're off the hook. We pay a lot for the Leica brand - I expect more. First, reduce the environmental impact of Leica ownership. That's the impact of manufacture, ownership and disposal. Second, improve value for money in ownership by long term support and upgrading componentry (the M9 sensor is a good example of getting this right). Third, standardise the product as much as possible so that parts become more interchangeable - for example, stick with the M10 size, stick with the M10 battery and charger and the dimensions for electronic parts - require your suppliers to design the components to fit your standardised product. That way, we might eek out more life from the cameras we own. While the experts line up to pooh pooh this suggestion, and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about, consider one thing - at no stage has Leica given any priority, or even thought to these issues. Making the M10 thinner is evidence enough. The M(240) has a good sized battery, and a body good to take any advance in technology required for M still photography, but they made it thinner to silence a sqeaky door here. And to sell more cameras ... The cost? no reverse compatibility with anything, except the lenses.

I bought it with the grip, but don\u2019t much care for the grip and generally leave that off. The base plate adds some bulk that I don\u2019t like so I only swap out on days when I\u2019m bringing a tripod 5) My favorite strap so far is actually model 14312\u2013the nylon strap designed for the M9. The connectors are ingenious, the strap is light and flexible, it\u2019s not expensive, and it stays up better than most. I only use a strap about \u00bc of the time, though. Generally prefer a bag and no strap. 6) EVF for shooting longer lenses. I don\u2019t need it or use it for anything up to 75mm; don\u2019t really use it with my 90mm much either since that is only an f/4 lens. But with the 135mm and 180mm it is all but indispensable. If I were younger and had better near vision I might make do with the rear display, but not any longer. Sure wish they had designed a new EVF for the M10, but the current one from the \u2018T\u2019 is actually not horrible. 7) 21mm external optical finder for use with my 21mm lenses. I\u2019ve actually been surprised how often I use it rather than just the rear screen. 8) Rocket blower for removing dust from the sensor before things get bad and I need a liquid cleaner. 9) Microfibre rag for cleaning fingerprints off the viewfinder window and (I hate to admit it) lens front elements. If you want to consider a bag as an accessory, I love the Hadley Small from Billingham, for this camera or any \u2018M\u2019 camera.

Not a big concern, but image matters to all of us. Best of all, the Hadley is thinner than most bags designed for SLR\u2019s, so it keeps the weight close to your body and just doesn\u2019t stick out much. Love it. Oh, and I also like the SF40 flash quite a bit. Flash isn\u2019t exactly Leica\u2019s strength, but this little Nissin unit actually does a nice job as a fill flash or for some basic bounce flash work in smaller spaces. Doesn\u2019t over balance the small Leica rangefinder. Still nothing to compete with the TTL evaluative flash metering you get with Nikon or Canon, but sometimes you just really need Some artificial light. After that, lenses, lenses, lenses. Leica owners seem to be the only camera owners willing to purchase multiple primes at the same focal length! I\u2019m guilty of that sin.

Fortunately the M240 is still around as well. For my daily use the M10 would be perfect, but I judge it as a travel camera. And there the 240 reigns. Better battery life, video, better hold with heavy/long lenses, those are things that count. Now I travel with a 2KG long lens combo included and 4 batteries which I really need. With the M10 it might be 6 to 8, depending on the power use by the new EVF. The better RFVF and EVF cannot compensate, and the results out of the camera will be mostly identical. It certainly does look that way with the new emphasis in my mind. Leica wants me to to use the SL - Not going to happen. I don't have an option but to try find a work around and try and push Leica to continue developing the M240 line or extend the M10-P with functionality that this world has evolved with. But a simple continuation of the M-240 won't do for me - it needs developing. Ideally, I need the M10 to have usb and I want to be shooting this in way into the future with sensor improvements as they happen, more resolution etc. Sometimes I am on location for 10 days at a time and there are times when we don't have the luxury of power to charge things. While I can make do with M9 battery life, I do have a silly amount of them and to regress in that department seems a disappointment to me also. I agree - this is a travel camera, it's one of the reasons I choose to use it, so again to take away core functionality is just wrong. Video has it's place moreso in this day and age than anything. I can't even begin to mention how much more useful it is to have in one body, at your finger tips to be ready at the decisive moment rather than a separate system you have to reach for etc. It seems crazy to me to pull this as well - this is 2017 and video is part of every day life and becoming even more so by the day.

I noticed in Ken Rockwell's M7 review that he was getting some blank negatives (some years ago) so when the shutter gets messed up or an M7 battery gets low we might see these blank (no light, no emulsion on negatives). I just realised Aperture doesn't have an Invert Image Colours facility so I made a crude N shape in curves which sort of worked for this purpose. The successful shots were probably when I switched to use the 1/60th or 1/125th manual settings. This was really a test film to see if newer batteries would solve the issue. Answer they didn't help the shutter blocking and wind-on issues. It was really messed-up, but hopefully soon fixed. Motto is to use the camera more. Or sell some of my cameras the M2 (same age as me) and this M7 when fixed, but keep my MP so the few films I do take each year keep the MP working. I have a Sony A7 with adapter for M mount so have either 35mm or 50mm summicrons on that it's useful for times when I take only a few shots at the weekend, but the slow manual focus process (press a button to pixel peak and focus, press shutter release to re-frame then shoot) makes even the MP seem fast and the M7 even faster as only focusing on fast moving kids is required. But the Sony A7 (\u00a3800) and 35f2 Asph gives great results for landscape. A \u00a35800 M10 just seems extreme even though it should be better for the wide angle lenses having the correct micro lenses on the sensor to support the wide angle light. Rubber / metal shutter Doesn't the rubber shutter also produce less vibration so the slower speeds can be used 1/15, 1/30th (depending on your steadiness of hand)? Can one use an M digital at these slow speeds or is the vibration more with metal shutter? And soft release helps another stop slower? I have suspicions that using a soft release on my M7 started the shutter blocking issues as even though it was OFF in the bag the soft release may be pressing the shutter in the tight fit bag. But that could all be coincidence and rubbish. I'm not using my soft release anymore but on pure mechanical cameras (M2 , M-A) it might be OK? It feels a bit like adding \u00a320 filters to the front of your expensive \u00a32000 Leica lenses in that it often causes glare and doesn't help the image. Using a lens hood and cap (often lost expensive to replace) is a better solution. A \u00a320 soft release on a \u00a32K - \u00a36K camera is perhaps not such a good idea either. My \u00a3130 Leica MP ER case rubbed the leatherette. Why be feeling the \u00a3130 case when you could be feeling the \u00a32K body? The MP/MA/M2/M3 film rewind attachment can often scuff the camera body. My Leica MP strap (plastic connector to body lug) has rubbed the sides of my MP chrome. M7 has a plastic bit on the camera body to stop that. I now have some black electrical tape to prevent the rubbing on both the MP and M2 and a piece over the Red Dot on the M7. I know we like to add accessories to our cameras to make them more unique but they don't always enhance our photos or our experience of the camera.

I want to have my filter and use it, too, with my lens hood. In about fifteen minutes, I made an adapter ring that works. Cost: less than $20. Since the inside aperture diameter of a 43mm filter is 40.5mm, I used a Heliopan 40.5-43mm step-up ring (#270), which has an outside diameter of 45mm, and though it fits the inside dimension of the Leica hood, it is 1mm too thick to fit behind the lens hood catches. Lay it flat on a sheet of medium grit sand paper with the male threads facing up, and sand it down, reducing the 4mm thickness to 3mm. This way it will fit perfectly inside the lens hood catches. It isn\u2019t necessary to bother sanding the male threads of the step-up ring. You are now finished with the lens hood filter adapter ring. Now screw a 43mm filter into the step-up ring until it seats, then back it off about one-quarter turn to allow for the thickness of the lens hood catches when you position the filter + step-up ring into the front of the Leica hood. With the lens hood off of your lens now, position the filter + step-up ring into the front of the hood, depressing the lens hood catches. Release the lens hood catches and adjust the filter until it is secure. Finally, attach the lens hood with the filter + step-up ring to the lens, and make any final adjustments screwing the filter slightly if needed into the step-up ring so the fit is snug. Using this adapter step-up ring allows you to attach the lens hood as it was designed to the lens. This filter adapter ring is the same as mounting a super slim 3+mm filter, plus a 4mm filter to the Lux. The lens hood mounts in its customary groove. Since the 4mm filter is adjusted for a snug fit, it is perhaps more secure. You can use a polarizer with LV by easily rotating the hood, also. No vignetting that I can see, since the filter extends only 7+mm from the lens. The downside is that the filter adapter with the filter must be removed from the hood so that the hood can be mounted reversed for traveling. A hassle, so the hood stays mounted. Another thing, don\u2019t take the hood off with the lens pointed down, since the filter with the adapter ring may fall out. As a side note, for my first go-around, I modified an inexpensive aluminum 43mm filter, removing the filter glass, sanding the threads, and reducing the thickness to 3mm. It worked fine, but it looked too proto-type funky. Yes, the step-up ring was easier. Less sanding. Realize that not all 40.5-43mm step-up rings may fit, some being too wide.

Even if many have been affected, you cannot expect a full recall of all lenses. I don't know what you would have expected of preventive measures? The preventive measure is that you can have the part changed, probably at a fraction of the cost of the lens, and far less than it has lost in value due to this issue. Policy better before?

Thats two ridiculous comments in a row . Lets establish what the real problem is first . The original AF module (including the plastic gear that strips) was designed for the S2 . Some lenses did fail but most didn t . It was after the S 007 was released with faster AF and the firmware was updated on the S 006 . At this point the load became too much for the AF gear and it stripped frequently . New lenses that were stiff or moved a lot of elements failed early . The 120 and 24 failed frequently when brand new . I have 9 Leica S lenses . My dealer who has more experience with this issue than anyone on this forum (because he has a lot of S customers ) ...predicted which lenses would fail BEFORE we mounted them . Five of the lenses failed immediately ....another two after some modest use . Two more to go . It didn t bother me a lot because I wasn t dependent on these lenses ..but friends went thru more than a year WITH NO SOLUTION . Since equipment upgrades come at least every 4 years even in MF ....thats out of service for 25% of the useful life . (I will not rehash the fiasco Leica USA had over the last year due to their botched SAP implementation ). But they actually LOST my friends 70mm S lens . In the past ..my Leica S lenses were fixed in a reasonable 6-8 weeks and none of my repaired lenses have failed . I was not charged in any way and my dealer handled the whole mess . The NEW POLICY is a bad joke ...... 5 years from new ? the original S2 was being sold more than 5 years ago ....so all those original lenses were out of warranty ? Even though the failure was caused by the new AF speeds of the S 007 and updated S 006 . This is not a wear and tear issue ..its a AF module that will not handle the load . WAIT UNTIL THEY FAIL ..when you have a known DEFECT or pay for the fix . I have a nice trip to Ireland end of summer ...will be very unhappy if any of my S lenses fail . This level of customer abuse is unprecedented even for Leica ! Now they have backed themselves into a corner ..issuing the policy statement .

Hm. No big deal though.Just to prepare the ground a bit, I'm a UK national living in Japan. I've been here since I was 22. It was my 39th birthday on the 26th (June) so I've been out East for quite a while now [with a break of a couple years back home in the middle]. Incidentally, that date was why I was motivated to post here. Not to be all hokey Godfather Part 3 \"on this day you to say to me...\" but R3D D0T posted a topic titled \"Anyone Still Using the S\" on the Leica S Forum -- can I just hold it there for a beat: 1, 2... -- and my S2-P was a well earned Birthday (26th) present to myself after so many years of dreaming. I couldn't resist. I am glad I decided to register and post though, I have enjoyed reading you guys for a good while now. I hope you all realize that this is about the only active third party source of info the S system that there is. Thank you all for it, sincerely.So, Anyone Still Using the S? Of course people still use, and dream about using, the S. Me for one. My whole life has been about it for the last four years. Rather than get defensive and start justifying the S, I think it's better to express honest passion about the system and photography with it. That's all I care about, I don't think I am alone. Responses to the question have been rad.At any rate, yea on the S35... Out here in Japan, and especially where I am in Tokyo, the Leica brand commands an extra premium compared to Europe and the US. The S is not as badly marked up as the M-system, but it is still marked up. The Leica S to Contax adaptor goes for \u00a5240,000 new here. I haven't seen a used one in four years of following the Japanese Leica S market, though that's not to say it's an a-priori impossibility. Never say never, just the chances are so slim the most realistic way to think about it is thinking about getting a brand new one, and they cost \u00a5240,000. The Contax645 35mm lenses, though, they certainly can be gotten used here and I see them going for ~\u00a590,000 on average in stores, maybe ~\u00a560~70,000 if Yahoo! Auction [Japan is wedded to Yahoo! and rather than eBay, everyone uses Yahoo! Auction here, just like they search the net with Yahoo! not Google. Don't ask!]... So the Contax 35mm budget would be ~\u00a5330,000 zone. But the extra upside to this option is as you guys say: it opens things up for other Contax lenses. I would say that that is an upside with caveats though.OK, going to the S35 option now, typically that lens goes for ~\u00a5550,000 on the used market here. There are very few places to get used S lenses in Japan, but amongst those \u00a5550,000 is about the median price. It will likely be 20 to 30% more than Europe or the US, depending on exchange rate, and again this is the premium that Leica commands here. It is what it is [believe me, I have struggled to get to the place where I can say that with Zen-like composure].Now then, I'm not sure if I should say this on here just incase anyone in Tokyo is watching, but there is a store with a consignment sale [store sells someone's used equipment for them, for a commission on the sale] on S equipment, and amongst that equipment is an S35mm. For \u00a5299,000. This price is so good, and so much better than usual, it seems worth taking the chance and making a small loan on to get. I could likely sell it for a profit straight away if the worst comes to the worst. I say that, but the lens is on sale at that price right now and no-one has snapped it up yet... so maybe not so simple... but still, every other S35mm on the used market that I know of is at the \u00a5550,000 mark, so this represents a great deal [and with the peace of mind that Leica will fix any AF gearing issues for free should they come up]. I don't have \u00a5299,000 in my pocket, especially after just having done the damn thing on the S2-P and an S70mm, but I am certainly giving it great thought.When I consider both 35mm choices, I think I'd rather stay native. This is weighted on subjective experience rather than any objective deciding factor. Many moons ago I bought a Sony A7 thinking I'd have a great time with vintage lenses and it'd be freedom and awesome and etc., etc., but what I actually found in practice was that when it really comes down to it, I preferred staying on plantation and using native, designed for purpose, lenses. I do not see this judgment as a black and white thing, nor do I see one data point as reflective of every case. But as a guide for my choice this time, yea, I am certainly leaning to stay native and go for that S35, if I can. I'm hesitant to take a small loan and do it on the S35 without a body to use it on... so, I have another choice now, a threefold choice: 1) forget all about it and concentrate on the work and stacking funds back up, wide angle photography work is done with my principal work equipment (Nikon f-mount), maybe in a few years we can think about S35 lenses again; 2) play it by the seat of my pants and stay in \"bag it\" mode, but wait for my body to come back and if the S35 is still there when it does, do it; or, 3) the nuclear option, just do it now.I am not asking for advice here, I will come to my conclusion and do one of these, probably the middle one, but just to give you guys an idea of where I'm at.My \"Stage1\" for the S-system is to get to: body (check) + S35 + S70(check) + S120 Makro. From a few years experience doing photography jobs, with those three optics (+brain) I can do 99% of my type of jobs; I can't do anything and everything, but for nearly all work that comes in, I'm covered. If the system is doing well, and being reliable, with those three lenses, and if it's handling that lion's share of work OK, then I'd start the f-mount system sell off and get another [newer] S body and maybe another lens or two [the T/S would be nice, but I'd really want that 30mm one they never made]. I'd switch over to Leica S exclusively then. Right now it's perfect for me to have Nikon F and Leica S as I get a real mix of work including event work and the Nikon is the camera for that [and has the T/S lenses and zooms, etc].I would like to transition over into portraiture for a bread and butter main: beauty, editorial, that kind of thing. An S would work fine for that and I could let the Nikon go, renting when needed, etc. It's all in the future though, first thing's first: get the S2-P back from Wetzlar and get doing work with it and the 70. Then maybe get into this S35.Thanks for having me guys.[While I'm writing a lot here, generally I'm more happy to read you all and keep my quiet]P/S I see an edit button has appeared below my post --img--  Edited June 29, 2017 by TomLiles", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/273817-anyone-still-using-the-s/?tab=comments#comment-3304456", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "273817-anyone-still-using-the-s", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "thank you d1 and matt, before -----> i !!!  begin, -----> i !!!  noticed immediately after posting before that -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  a couple typos in my original post -- \"-----> i !!!  doubt about it\" should have been \"no doubt about it,\" and preceding that a line \"...there is little to single it out for and it criticize it for...\" had an \"it\" extra in there -- but -----> i !!!  can't find a tool to edit my post?i saw a couple of the other guys are able to edit their posts after publishing so -----> i !!! 'm sure it's possible... just wondering if it's a function not available to newbies or that -----> i !!! 'm missing something right in front of my eyes? hm. no big deal though.just to prepare the ground a bit, i'm a uk national living in japan. i've been here since i was 22. it was my 39th birthday on the 26th (june) so i've been out east for quite a while now [with a break of a couple years back home in the middle]. incidentally, that date was why i was motivated to post here. not to be all hokey godfather part 3 \"on this day you to say to me...\" but r3d d0t posted a topic titled \"anyone still using the s\" on the leica s forum -- can i just hold it there for a beat: 1, 2... -- and my s2-p was a well earned birthday (26th) present to myself after so many years of dreaming. i couldn't resist. i am glad i decided to register and post though, i have enjoyed reading you guys for a good while now. i hope you all realize that this is about the only active third party source of info the s system that there is. thank you all for it, sincerely.so, anyone still using the s? of course people still use, and dream about using, the s. me for one. my whole life has been about it for the last four years. rather than get defensive and start justifying the s, i think it's better to express honest passion about the system and photography with it. that's all i care about, i don't think i am alone. responses to the question have been rad.at any rate, yea on the s35... out here in japan, and especially where i am in tokyo, the leica brand commands an extra premium compared to europe and the us. the s is not as badly marked up as the m-system, but it is still marked up. the leica s to contax adaptor goes for \u00a5240,000 new here. i haven't seen a used one in four years of following the japanese leica s market, though that's not to say it's an a-priori impossibility. never say never, just the chances are so slim the most realistic way to think about it is thinking about getting a brand new one, and they cost \u00a5240,000. the contax645 35mm lenses, though, they certainly can be gotten used here and i see them going for ~\u00a590,000 on average in stores, maybe ~\u00a560~70,000 if yahoo! auction [japan is wedded to yahoo! and rather than ebay, everyone uses yahoo! auction here, just like they search the net with yahoo! not google. don't ask!]... so the contax 35mm budget would be ~\u00a5330,000 zone. but the extra upside to this option is as you guys say: it opens things up for other contax lenses. i would say that that is an upside with caveats though.ok, going to the s35 option now, typically that lens goes for ~\u00a5550,000 on the used market here. there are very few places to get used s lenses in japan, but amongst those \u00a5550,000 is about the median price. it will likely be 20 to 30% more than europe or the us, depending on exchange rate, and again this is the premium that leica commands here. it is what it is [believe me, i have struggled to get to the place where i can say that with zen-like composure].now then, i'm not sure if i should say this on here just incase anyone in tokyo is watching, but there is a store with a consignment sale [store sells someone's used equipment for them, for a commission on the sale] on s equipment, and amongst that equipment is an s35mm. for \u00a5299,000. this price is so good, and so much better than usual, it seems worth taking the chance and making a small loan on to get. i could likely sell it for a profit straight away if the worst comes to the worst. i say that, but the lens is on sale at that price right now and no-one has snapped it up yet... so maybe not so simple... but still, every other s35mm on the used market that i know of is at the \u00a5550,000 mark, so this represents a great deal [and with the peace of mind that leica will fix any af gearing issues for free should they come up]. i don't have \u00a5299,000 in my pocket, especially after just having done the damn thing on the s2-p and an s70mm, but i am certainly giving it great thought.when i consider both 35mm choices, i think i'd rather stay native. this is weighted on subjective experience rather than any objective deciding factor. many moons ago i bought a sony a7 thinking i'd have a great time with vintage lenses and it'd be freedom and awesome and etc., etc., but what i actually found in practice was that when it really comes down to it, i preferred staying on plantation and using native, designed for purpose, lenses. i do not see this judgment as a black and white thing, nor do i see one data point as reflective of every case. but as a guide for my choice this time, yea, i am certainly leaning to stay native and go for that s35, if i can. i'm hesitant to take a small loan and do it on the s35 without a body to use it on... so, i have another choice now, a threefold choice: 1) forget all about it and concentrate on the work and stacking funds back up, wide angle photography work is done with my principal work equipment (nikon f-mount), maybe in a few years we can think about s35 lenses again; 2) play it by the seat of my pants and stay in \"bag it\" mode, but wait for my body to come back and if the s35 is still there when it does, do it; or, 3) the nuclear option, just do it now.i am not asking for advice here, i will come to my conclusion and do one of these, probably the middle one, but just to give you guys an idea of where i'm at.my \"stage1\" for the s-system is to get to: body (check) + s35 + s70(check) + s120 makro. from a few years experience doing photography jobs, with those three optics (+brain) i can do 99% of my type of jobs; i can't do anything and everything, but for nearly all work that comes in, i'm covered. if the system is doing well, and being reliable, with those three lenses, and if it's handling that lion's share of work ok, then i'd start the f-mount system sell off and get another [newer] s body and maybe another lens or two [the t/s would be nice, but i'd really want that 30mm one they never made]. i'd switch over to leica s exclusively then. right now it's perfect for me to have nikon f and leica s as i get a real mix of work including event work and the nikon is the camera for that [and has the t/s lenses and zooms, etc].i would like to transition over into portraiture for a bread and butter main: beauty, editorial, that kind of thing. an s would work fine for that and i could let the nikon go, renting when needed, etc. it's all in the future though, first thing's first: get the s2-p back from wetzlar and get doing work with it and the 70. then maybe get into this s35.thanks for having me guys.[while i'm writing a lot here, generally i'm more happy to read you all and keep my quiet]p/s i see an edit button has appeared below my post --img--  edited june 29, 2017 by tomliles", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 32651, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "TomLiles", "date": "2017-07-01 00:40:00", "content": "Hi again D1, Thanks for the information and advice. I have a read a lot about Leica Miami [and David Farkas] over the years and believe the rep. My main issue to iron out with overseas dealers would be the approach to the after-sales service with an international customer; but also, and probably something I'd be on my own on, customs: import duties, taxes, charges, what have you. Just as you say.A good friend once sent me his M35 Summilux ASPH (the FLE one) to borrow [i used an M6TTL for three years, gone now to fund the S]. A very kind-hearted and good friend (and an amazing lens but wasted a little on film perhaps). When his lens arrived at my door, it came with some kind of import tariff which was ~10% of the cost the goods [if I recall correctly]; I do remember that hit being about \u00a530,000. When I protested that this was not a purchase, just a zero-yen loaner between friends and the lens would be going back the other way, didn't even matter. And I can half understand that as if they had tariff-free provisions for equipment being swapped between peers from country to country, it wouldn't be long before it got abused... At any rate, once bitten twice shy and I'm cautious about stuff from overseas. I also half suspect this has something to do with the reason the import gear from cars to clothes to Leica lenses is so much more expensive here, it's a cost even retailers can't get around; I'm sure if it weren't, some ambitious camera store would have undercut everyone on the Leicas by now.Yea, I have learnt to plan for equipment carefully. Especially sensitive with the S. When I started way back when I easily fell into the \"GAS\" mindset and wasted a lot of hard-earned on trinkets and trends and things the photoblogosphere had said was game-changing, etc. I wouldn't say it was money down the drain as I love photography and using those things has been amazing and a blessing; but when it came to listening to what the bloggers would all say and then following, it was dereliction of my own duty or maybe better to say an outsourcing of responsibility... I'm not saying anything you don't know, but owning it is important with photography purchases because for one it literally becomes a reality but also the figurative angle has to be attended to. It's not good enough to say I bought it because so-and-so said so.All experience is useful, if we make it so, so my mistakes of yesterday are data-points to fuel better decisions tomorrow... My experience has been to have both emotional and practical reasons to buy a thing. Be sure about it [as far as that is feasible to be]. If in doubt, don't; but definitely listen to your heart. And a nice line from portraitist Sue Bryce [who is a good business-woman, in my view]: if it doesn't make the ship go faster, I don't need it. If I have a roadmap, doesn't have to perfect but at least some kind of vision or plan, if I have that before setting out it makes it easier to stay away from the fluff and focus on what I really want to do. It's work equipment for me, and while the tax credits help it's still money out the door and there has to be a good reason and purpose to do that. I'm a hot-blooded type too though, and doing everything like a dry accountant makes me want to run and jump from the nearest window: being paid to do photography is living the dream and dampening that emotional spark, on purpose, is not on the menu. I settled into Nikon f-mount in 2013 as a work system, and have been working with various f-mount bodies and lenses since then. From these few years of trying, failing, succeeding, failing again with equipment I have a decent idea of the lenses I really really use, those I don't; what I need and what I don't. Not definitive, but just a pretty good idea. So making my dream with the S come true right now, I have a really clear plan of which lenses fulfill the basic needs I have to make it fly as a work camera. I will run it with the 70mm for a good while: a scenario I could call stage1 of stage1, as it were, just one lens is all I'd need to get by [the S70mm]. A wide angle prime is more useful to me than a short tele macro, so the S35 would be lens buy #2. And then the S120 makro for #3. With those three lenses, and assuming the body has held up to workhorse standards, I'd go all in with it as a main work camera. If not, it is still my dream, so the S would stay with me as a specialist flavor camera, a luxury, but one I'd keep as long as possible. It took so long getting to the S I'm not going to get out of it easily.I like the S as it lets me be both sides of myself and achieve both things I want to do [serious work equipment + fantasista camera].

An f/4.5 lens, ISO 400 film, 1/200 shutter speed seems adequate for more shadow detail in these pictures. Why did you have the iris set at 11, and what does that number correspond to in current terms? Thank you for your question. It is a good one and it challenges my statement that may turn out to be wrong. I am slowly learning about the performance of this camera one film at a time. This is just as Barnack must have experienced one hundred years ago. You are correct that the lens is a f4.5 Micro Summar. And I agree that shooting with 400 asa film, the exposure should be enough for low light but my experience is that even using the slowest shutter speed (low spring tension on shutter curtain) I have thin negatives as a result. As for the number 11, I made a mistake it should have been the number 10. This is the number on the UR camera lens barrel and I do not know what this number is in relation to f stop. I have been guessing that it is around f11 but that is a guess. I do know that it is the smallest iris opening on the Micro Summar 42mm lens available. I also do not know what the shutter speed is. I estimate that it is around 250 with max spring tension on shutter curtain but do not know the exact shutter speed. Therefor this is an educated guess. Also I do not know the slow shutter speed but estimate it is around 100. These are guesses based on the exposed film. When I say it is a fair weather camera, I mean that my best exposures have been during the day with full light. I also note that all the photos that I have seen taken by Barnack and Ernest Leitz, were taken during the day. I have never seen a low light level picture taken with the original UR camera. The limitation for Barnack was the low asa film available for cine film 100 years ago. The limitation for me is the fixed 8mm wide slit in the shutter curtain. This all means that there are limitations on the kinds of exposure available with the camera. I do know that Barnack claimed that his shutter curtain had a window of 40 mm. This would have compensated somewhat for the slow film asa of the day. This 40 mm window on the curtain would have allowed five times more light on the film if the curtain speed was the same as on my UR Replica. But we do not know if my shutter curtain is traveling at the same speed as that of Barnack's camera. It is really frustrating to have so many unknown variables that I just have to guess at. As a scientist one of the first rules of any experiment is to limit your variables and define your parameters. The only one I know for this camera is that at infinity, the pictures are very sharp. I still have to learn if the focus marks on the UR Leica are correct but my first try at this indicated that they are not on the mark even though I am using the same lens that we are told Barnack camera used. In summary, I am still in the early stages of exploring the range of pictures one can take with this camera. My experience after 5 rolls of 400 asa film is that the negatives are thin in low light and the best pictures are those taken in full daylight. I also must say that most of my pictures were taken with the tightest shutter curtain spring setting and the 10 setting on the iris diaphram.

I wish to make a few comments. I love its size and it can easily be carried in one's pocket. The lens, a 42 mm Micro Summar is sharp and a good lens for taking pictures in daytime but there are limitations to this camera at the same time. The lens f stop of 4.5 wide open limits light and reminds me of the Summaron f5.6/28mm lens. That it is, it is sharp, small and has a wide depth of field. The pictures remind me of the classic little camera the Rollie 35 that comes with a 40mm fixed lens. The similarity is that the UR camera, like the Rollie 35, one cannot unscrew it and put on a faster lens for low light or to limit depth of field. Another factor is the shutter speeds are limited. There is no way to take long exposures. Now that I confirmed that the focus marks on my converted dummy UR are spot on for the 42mm micro Summar thereby confirming that this is the lens on the one in the Leitz Wetzlar museum. Now I am moving on to the shutter speeds. The original camera Barnack built in 1913-14 had a very simple shutter curtain having a 38mm shutter window on a single curtain passing between two shutter barrels. We are told that the shutter speeds with this opening was 1/40th and 1/60th of a second. These speeds are controlled by tightening or loosening the spring on the take up shutter barrel. This is controlled by the knob on the top of the UR next to the accessory shoe. Screwed all the way counterclockwise the spring is fully tightened. Turned the other way, the spring is loosened and the shutter curtain passes over the film at a slower speed. I have now estimated the shutter speeds of my camera to be 1/200 second with the spring turned fully clockwise and 1/300 second with the spring fully tightened. This is based on the best exposures using 400asa film. This is interesting because if one compares my 8mm window on the curtain with Barnack's 38mm window, mine is a little less than 1/4 Barnack's shutter window. This means a little more than 4 times less exposure of the film. Therefor 1/40sec exposure on the Barnack camera is equilivant to 1/190sec on my camera and the 1/60th exposure on the Barnack camera is equivalent to 1/300sec on my UR Replica. All this means that even with 400asa film, one must have a well lit scene. Of course that other difference from the Rollie 35 is that you must load and unload the camera in darkness. It just means that I must have a changing bag if you wish to expose more than one roll of film on an outing. With all these limitations I continue to enjoy using this camera. The thought that I am experiencing what E.Leitz experienced and what Barnack experienced makes up for any limitations. Also with my background in design, I really admire the ability of Barnack, the mechanic, to design such a revolutionary camera!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/138638-working-ur-leica/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3215742", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "138638-working-ur-leica", "result": true, "Selector": "i wish to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "now that i have had two months of taking pictures with this gem called the ur-leica. -----> i !!!  -----> wish !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  a few comments. i love its size and it can easily be carried in one's pocket. the lens, a 42 mm micro summar is sharp and a good lens for taking pictures in daytime but there are limitations to this camera at the same time. the lens f stop of 4.5 wide open limits light and reminds me of the summaron f5.6/28mm lens. that it is, it is sharp, small and has a wide depth of field. the pictures remind me of the classic little camera the rollie 35 that comes with a 40mm fixed lens. the similarity is that the ur camera, like the rollie 35, one cannot unscrew it and put on a faster lens for low light or to limit depth of field. another factor is the shutter speeds are limited. there is no way to take long exposures. now that i confirmed that the focus marks on my converted dummy ur are spot on for the 42mm micro summar thereby confirming that this is the lens on the one in the leitz wetzlar museum. now i am moving on to the shutter speeds. the original camera barnack built in 1913-14 had a very simple shutter curtain having a 38mm shutter window on a single curtain passing between two shutter barrels. we are told that the shutter speeds with this opening was 1/40th and 1/60th of a second. these speeds are controlled by tightening or loosening the spring on the take up shutter barrel. this is controlled by the knob on the top of the ur next to the accessory shoe. screwed all the way counterclockwise the spring is fully tightened. turned the other way, the spring is loosened and the shutter curtain passes over the film at a slower speed. i have now estimated the shutter speeds of my camera to be 1/200 second with the spring turned fully clockwise and 1/300 second with the spring fully tightened. this is based on the best exposures using 400asa film. this is interesting because if one compares my 8mm window on the curtain with barnack's 38mm window, mine is a little less than 1/4 barnack's shutter window. this means a little more than 4 times less exposure of the film. therefor 1/40sec exposure on the barnack camera is equilivant to 1/190sec on my camera and the 1/60th exposure on the barnack camera is equivalent to 1/300sec on my ur replica. all this means that even with 400asa film, one must have a well lit scene. of course that other difference from the rollie 35 is that you must load and unload the camera in darkness. it just means that i must have a changing bag if you wish to expose more than one roll of film on an outing. with all these limitations i continue to enjoy using this camera. the thought that i am experiencing what e.leitz experienced and what barnack experienced makes up for any limitations. also with my background in design, i really admire the ability of barnack, the mechanic, to design such a revolutionary camera!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 35681, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "George Furst", "date": "2017-03-11 12:20:00", "content": "This is my third month of using the UR Leica Replica modified from a 1970s Leitz Wetzlar Dummy number 28 by my talented camera engineer in Seoul. Here I will share a few of the things that I have learned during this time. I have already put over 30 rolls of film through the camera and I can confirm that the UR Leica Replica takes excellent pictures. To date I have only used black and white film, both Kentmere 400 and now Kodak Tmax 100 film. Also I am bulk loading cassettes and done all the developing with Kodak D76. You may ask why I use a cassette when the camera does not take a cassette. Working with a cassette with loaded film is much easier than working with a bulk roll of many yards of film in the dark. It also ensures that I have the right length. Here are a few of the things that I have learned: 1. Barnack's camera had a fame counter that went up to 50. I tried loading a film with fifty frames and it does work. You can actually load enough film for fifty frames. I did this just to test that it would work. But I routinely go with 36 frames because it is a squeeze to get that longer length of film into the small space on the film loading side of the camera. Also the take up spool is really hard to pull out of the camera when it has that length of film necessary to have 50 frames on it, but I could do it! 2. The focus registration on the Dummy does match the 42mm Micro Summar lens that I have in my replica of the UR (I have mentioned this in a prior post). This was a great relief as I did not have to modify the focus register on the front of the lens holder. It is also an indication that the dummy model is set up to work with the 42mm Micro Summar lens. 3. One must cut a leader on the film prior to loading, just like one must do with the Leica bottom loading screw mount cameras. I learned the hard way and jammed the camera. I learned that it is very difficult to remove the film once it is on the pressure plate! I learned to never do that again! 4. When you pull out the front of the camera with the lens, one must check that it is pulled out all the way. My camera has a tight fit on this lens holder and a few times the picture was not in focus and I am sure that was due to not having the lens pulled out all the way. On the O seried camera and the Leica 1a, there is a lock for the lens that are pulled out prior to taking the picture. I am sure that Barnack did this because he lost a few pictures as I did. 5. The camera will focus beyond infinity. It is not that way because of temperature changes like in the longer R lens. It is a quirk of the construction of the UR Leica dummy that I have. I found that I had to put a washer under one of the screws which is perfectly positioned to become a stop at infinity on the focusing knob. 6. The two spools that hold the film have two different diameters. The feeding spool had a smaller diameter than the take up spool. One time I loaded the leader on the film in the dark to the wrong spool. I soon realized that I could not fit the spool into the feeding spool location. I had loaded the wrong one, the take up spool. Now I know why Barnack marked each spool with a roman numeral I and II. The feeding spool has the roman numeral one and the receiving spool has the number two. It was a good idea and helps one to avoid this mistake on loading incorrectly. But then in the dark one cannot see these marks. Therefor I always start the tongue of the film from the cassette to the take up spool with the roman numeral two before turning off the lights. This ensures that I do not make this mistake again. 7. How do you tell if you have run out of film? There are no knobs that connect to the film. Also on my replica I do not have an operational film counter. This was a step too far at the time and I wanted to get on with taking pictures with my Leitz Wetzlar Dummy now Replica. Maybe the resistance of the film being released from the feed spool would signal the end of the film. I have found this not to be the case! Also listening to the camera may work but when out and about taking pictures this is a little awkward and with all the gears moving, I find it hard to tell if film is moving on the pressure plate. I have found that there are two ways. one is to listen to the film end flipping round on the take op spool. The other, and the best way, is shaking the camera. When the feel spool is empty, it raddles in its compartment and this tells me that the film is all in the receiving side of the camera. 8. There are light leaks from the plate that is screwed onto the back of the camera. I now use a four digit !a camera case to block the lower light leaks and electrical tape to block to upper leaks. Not an elegant solution but it works. My camera engineer has said he can fix this but I haven't wanted to be without the camera for a week as I must go up to Seoul to do that and recent events indicate that is best not to move closer to the DMZ! Discussion on the Lens that was used on the Barnack UR Leica This to me is a very important topic. I was disappointed that Leitz Wetzlar never mentioned anything about the original lens used in the 100 anniversary celebration of the UR in 1914. In fact they mentioned very little about the construction of the camera in any of the related publications. That is my inspiration for trying to fill this gap. The lens used by Barnack is surprisingly sharp, and the lens I am using is too, but was it the lens used in the original UR? Most discussions about the UR camera skip this topic. This is like a hamburger without the meat! According to the information researched above by 'ecdysiast' the 42mm lens was not Barnack's first choice. I have also gone through all my references and I agree with this prior post that the first lens was probably the 50mm f3.5 Kino Tessar from Zeiss, the same lens he used on the Barnack Cine (movie) Camera of the same period. Since this format is one half the UR Leica format, it would clearly show a fall off in focus on the diagonal corners when used on the Barnack full frame UR. I have looked for pictures claimed to have been taken with the UR looking for the fall off in the corners, One picture I have found is the aerial photograph Barnack took of a town center (What town is it?) from the Zeppelin. It clearly shows a sharp central area and a blurred image in the diagonal corners. He probably was using the Zeiss 50mm cine lens for this picture. Evidently he also used the 64mm f4.5 Micro Summar, but I find no examples of pictures with the expected slight telephoto effect. Therefor this lens must have been used only for a very short time. The majority of pictures are clearly slightly wide angle indicating that he was soon using the 42mm Micro Summar lens from the same Leitz manufactured group as the 64mm lens. This is the six element gauss design 42mm f4.5 lens, a standard cataloged lens (see table above) from over 100 years ago. This is the same lens that was given me as a gift. Evidently Leitz Wetzlar optical engineers examined the lens on the UR camera, now stored in a vault, and it was measured to have a 42mm focal length. There was only one lens made by Leitz at that time with this focal length and it was the above 42mm f4.5 Micro Summar lens. I am using this six element lens and I find that it is very sharp and performs very well from close up to infinity. I will soon be posting more pictures to support this claim so stay tuned!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/138638-working-ur-leica/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3231347", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "138638-working-ur-leica", "result": true, "Selector": "i do not make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "this is my third month of using the ur leica replica modified from a 1970s leitz wetzlar dummy number 28 by my talented camera engineer in seoul. here i will share a few of the things that i have learned during this time. i have already put over 30 rolls of film through the camera and i can confirm that the ur leica replica takes excellent pictures. to date i have only used black and white film, both kentmere 400 and now kodak tmax 100 film. also i am bulk loading cassettes and done all the developing with kodak d76. you may ask why i use a cassette when the camera does not take a cassette. working with a cassette with loaded film is much easier than working with a bulk roll of many yards of film in the dark. it also ensures that i have the right length. here are a few of the things that i have learned: 1. barnack's camera had a fame counter that went up to 50. i tried loading a film with fifty frames and it does work. you can actually load enough film for fifty frames. i did this just to test that it would work. but i routinely go with 36 frames because it is a squeeze to get that longer length of film into the small space on the film loading side of the camera. also the take up spool is really hard to pull out of the camera when it has that length of film necessary to have 50 frames on it, but i could do it! 2. the focus registration on the dummy does match the 42mm micro summar lens that i have in my replica of the ur (i have mentioned this in a prior post). this was a great relief as i did not have to modify the focus register on the front of the lens holder. it is also an indication that the dummy model is set up to work with the 42mm micro summar lens. 3. one must cut a leader on the film prior to loading, just like one must do with the leica bottom loading screw mount cameras. i learned the hard way and jammed the camera. i learned that it is very difficult to remove the film once it is on the pressure plate! i learned to never do that again! 4. when you pull out the front of the camera with the lens, one must check that it is pulled out all the way. my camera has a tight fit on this lens holder and a few times the picture was not in focus and i am sure that was due to not having the lens pulled out all the way. on the o seried camera and the leica 1a, there is a lock for the lens that are pulled out prior to taking the picture. i am sure that barnack did this because he lost a few pictures as i did. 5. the camera will focus beyond infinity. it is not that way because of temperature changes like in the longer r lens. it is a quirk of the construction of the ur leica dummy that i have. i found that i had to put a washer under one of the screws which is perfectly positioned to become a stop at infinity on the focusing knob. 6. the two spools that hold the film have two different diameters. the feeding spool had a smaller diameter than the take up spool. one time i loaded the leader on the film in the dark to the wrong spool. i soon realized that i could not fit the spool into the feeding spool location. i had loaded the wrong one, the take up spool. now i know why barnack marked each spool with a roman numeral i and ii. the feeding spool has the roman numeral one and the receiving spool has the number two. it was a good idea and helps one to avoid this mistake on loading incorrectly. but then in the dark one cannot see these marks. therefor i always start the tongue of the film from the cassette to the take up spool with the roman numeral two before turning off the lights. this ensures that -----> i !!!  -----> do !!!  -----> not !!!  -----> make !!!  this mistake again. 7. how do you tell if you have run out of film?

Though I was only a student at the time my funds were boosted by birthday present money and a few days after my birthday I found myself browsing in the window of the London Camera Exchange in Exeter. Up to this point I had started with my mother's 127 Brownie (8 on 127) no shutter wind on interlock, had progressed at the age of 5 to my own 127 Brownie (12 on 127) with shutter wind interlock and then on to my Grandfather's Praktica Nova 1 SLR which he gave to me when he became fed up with it - could never get the hang of loading 35mm film! I hankered after a new camera and went looking at Leicas - the design appealed - I don't know why - it just did - plus the fact they were built in Germany and I had always been brought up by my parents to believe that if it was \"Made in Germany\" it was as good as or even better than \"Made in Britain\". Of course there was no way I could afford a new or even used M at this point. Funds were boosted in October 1980 when my 21st birthday came along. A couple of days later, browsing the window of the London Camera Exchange in Exeter I spotted a Leica IIIa range finder for \u00a379 complete with ever-ready case. The IIIa dated from the late 1930s and came complete with uncoated 5cm f2 Summar lens. Within moments I had my first Leica! It might have been just over 40 years old and survived WWII but it appeared to be in very good condition. The base loading procedure, however, came as a bit of a shock but on a bus trip to Bude in Cornwall that day I soon worked out how to load it! By the time I arrived in Bude I was ready for action! Being interested in trains, buses and ships I pointed the camera at a bus at the bus stop in Bude and I had taken my first Leica photo. Unfortunately by the time I had returned home to Liverpool a few days later I discovered that when the film was processed the camera had a light leak as you can see from this scanned copy of my first Leica slide. --img-- The camera was posted off back to Exeter and repaired, but I lost confidence in it and went back to using the Praktica and a recently bought Rollei 35. I still wanted a Leica, but something more recent. Some years later I did buy a nice mint IIIF with 5cm collapsible Elmar and a 9cm cm Elmar. This Leica IIIF camera was used for some b/w negative work but along with a lot of my photo gear was sold on 1996 when I switched to the Contax G1 system. Next came a Leica AF-C1 my first new albeit Minolta produced Leica - then the Fuji built Digilux Zoom, D1, D2, D3, V-Lux 1, C-Lux 1, V-Lux 3, X1, X- Vario and finally in October 2016 some 36 years since I bought that IIIA I walked out of Leicastore Manchester with my first brand new Leica M262 rangefinder! I finally got there in the end. For some time I have been working on a personal photographic history file for my web site which I am calling from \"Yellow Box to Red Dot\" when I complete it I will post a copy here - but basically it tells the tale of how I maintained that dream to get my own new Leica M. I made some bad decisions on the way and perhaps could have made the jump to in 1996 to the M range but was lured away by the Contax G1 digital rangefinder as I could have a full outfit for the same price as an M with standard lens. But the important thing is I finally reached my goal and I am now in the process of considering what will be my third M lens!

Here is some of what I leaned in those 4 days. A great photo tells a story about a subject and context. Which is to say, photography is about framing and perspective. Ansel Adams said, \"A good photograph is knowing where to stand.\" By simply moving the camera a little to the left or right, or forward or backward, you modify the perspective. Choosing a 24mm or a 90mm lens changes the framing. A photographer makes simple choices. When these choices coalesce, the result is magical. At the Photographer's discretion Where you stand Direction of the camera Focus (both subject and depth of field) Exposure Framing Aren't these the same choices we make in life? Living well is often a matter of focus, framing and perspective. A simple experience like morning coffee or walking on the beach may be enjoyable. Sometimes including a friend or loved one in this action makes it better. Including others in an experience is like \"zooming out\" in a photograph. You can enhance the quality of the experience by including others. But if you include too many people that walk on the beach or the cup of coffee might not be as enjoyable. The noise of the scene drowns out the enjoyment of the experience. Pay attention to the edges of the photo. The center is easy since we have an idea of what we want to photograph. But it is the edges that really make the difference. I improved my abstract photo of the wavy rocks by excluding the scrap of vegetation. Putting thought into what to include and what to discard makes a big difference. And isn't the same in life? Aren't there people that creep onto the edges that we would be better off without?

I invite you to an open discussion about this based on my own experience (a little long text maybe). As many others, I contacted Leica due to some suspicious looking rows of dots on my pictures taken at low apertures. Leica Customer care looked at the samples I sent them and told me that I had to send my camera (M9P) to them to have it checked. Here is my first experience with Leica Customer Care described step wise. It is the service experience that I would like to discuss and not the specific technical problem: > I spent 150 Euro on shipping and insurance to have the camera sent to Leica. I had to make them confirm that they had received the camera. They didn\u2019t do that automatically. > After a short while I got a message from Leica that the sensor was not defective but they would clean the sensor and adjust the rangefinder etc. I was happy with that, and said thank you. > After some weeks of waiting I contacted Leica to hear when they would send the camera back to me. I was told by a technician that I hadn\u2019t communicated with before that there was a lead time of an additional 2 \u00bd months to have the camera cleaned. At that time they had already had the camera for more than a month. > I contacted Leica and told them to send the camera back to me un-cleaned since I had to use it for a field trip. I was the contacted by the first person that I had communicated with and he told me that they could have it cleaned and send back within a week. I was happy with that, and said thank you. > I got my camera back within the week as promised. However, as I went to check it I was really disappointed. The sensor was very dirty and hair-like strands that were not there before showed very clearly on the pictures even at F4. In fact the sensor was much worse than before and the dots that were the reason for sending the camera to Leica were indeed still visible. Along with the camera Leica had sent a certificate stating that the sensor had been cleaned and the camera cap was \u201csealed off\u201d with the orange sticker. I personally do not believe that the sensor had been cleaned. > I contacted Leica again and told them in a friendly way that I did not see the problem solved. They returned to me and apologized and suggested that they had my camera back again. I told Leica that I was a bit reluctant to just send the camera back without knowing what would be done to it, and how long time it would take. They told me to send some DNGs that showed the problem, and they would find a swift solution \u2013 which I did. > After a couple of days I got a mail by accident from Leica. It was internal communication between my contact and a technician. In the mail I was characterized as being very \u201cunzufrieden\u201d which I actually don\u2019t think was quite right. I had only pointed out the problems as described in an objective way. Internal mails ending up at the customer should really not happen. This is a big mistake in my eyes. > After some additional waiting time I contacted Leica to hear their conclusions, and after some more time I got the message that they needed to have the camera back to overhaul the sensor and evaluate if it needed to be changed. That was actually what they should have done when they got the camera in the first place, and they had already stated that the sensor was OK and cleaned anyway. > I contacted Leica and told them that I could not send in the camera right now because I needed it for a field trip, so I would dry clean the sensor myself to remove the dust, and then send in the camera at a later stage for the other problems. I asked if they could provide me with a device and a method for blowing the dust off. > After some more time I got a mail from a Danish agent that had not been in contact before. They told me that they heard I had problems with dust on the sensor and suggested that I contacted a certain Dealer in Denmark who they know is a Nikon/Canon expert??! > I will now search this forum and find a method to dry clean my sensor myself, and subsequently decide further actions\u2026I need to go shooting rather than writing. I have 15 years of experience with technical service, and to me this is a very inconsistent performance by Leica \u2013 both in terms of communication and actions. So, my question: is there any learning for Leica here \u2013 and could we give them some constructive feedback and ideas for improvement? What is your experience? I am completely puzzled by this. Leica sends a shipping label to collect a camera and returns it free of charge, so there should be no shipping costs involved unless the customer insists on handling the shipping himself. Secondly, dust on the sensor is not a reason to send a camera in. Either one does the cleaning oneself - which is preferable, as it is practical to spend the five minutes instead of wasting time and money to get somebody else to do so, or one avails oneself of the service of one of the many sensor cleaning businesses available.

i invite you to an open discussion about this based on my own experience (a little long text maybe). as many others, i contacted leica due to some suspicious looking rows of dots on my pictures taken at low apertures. leica customer care looked at the samples i sent them and told me that i had to send my camera (m9p) to them to have it checked. here is my first experience with leica customer care described step wise. it is the service experience that i would like to discuss and not the specific technical problem: > i spent 150 euro on shipping and insurance to have the camera sent to leica. -----> i !!!  -----> had !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  them confirm that they -----> had !!!  received the camera. they didn\u2019t do that automatically. > after a short while i got a message from leica that the sensor was not defective but they would clean the sensor and adjust the rangefinder etc. i was happy with that, and said thank you. > after some weeks of waiting i contacted leica to hear when they would send the camera back to me. i was told by a technician that i hadn\u2019t communicated with before that there was a lead time of an additional 2 \u00bd months to have the camera cleaned. at that time they had already had the camera for more than a month. > i contacted leica and told them to send the camera back to me un-cleaned since i had to use it for a field trip. i was the contacted by the first person that i had communicated with and he told me that they could have it cleaned and send back within a week. i was happy with that, and said thank you. > i got my camera back within the week as promised. however, as i went to check it i was really disappointed. the sensor was very dirty and hair-like strands that were not there before showed very clearly on the pictures even at f4. in fact the sensor was much worse than before and the dots that were the reason for sending the camera to leica were indeed still visible. along with the camera leica had sent a certificate stating that the sensor had been cleaned and the camera cap was \u201csealed off\u201d with the orange sticker. i personally do not believe that the sensor had been cleaned. > i contacted leica again and told them in a friendly way that i did not see the problem solved. they returned to me and apologized and suggested that they had my camera back again. i told leica that i was a bit reluctant to just send the camera back without knowing what would be done to it, and how long time it would take. they told me to send some dngs that showed the problem, and they would find a swift solution \u2013 which i did. > after a couple of days i got a mail by accident from leica. it was internal communication between my contact and a technician. in the mail i was characterized as being very \u201cunzufrieden\u201d which i actually don\u2019t think was quite right. i had only pointed out the problems as described in an objective way. internal mails ending up at the customer should really not happen. this is a big mistake in my eyes. > after some additional waiting time i contacted leica to hear their conclusions, and after some more time i got the message that they needed to have the camera back to overhaul the sensor and evaluate if it needed to be changed. that was actually what they should have done when they got the camera in the first place, and they had already stated that the sensor was ok and cleaned anyway. > i contacted leica and told them that i could not send in the camera right now because i needed it for a field trip, so i would dry clean the sensor myself to remove the dust, and then send in the camera at a later stage for the other problems. i asked if they could provide me with a device and a method for blowing the dust off. > after some more time i got a mail from a danish agent that had not been in contact before. they told me that they heard i had problems with dust on the sensor and suggested that i contacted a certain dealer in denmark who they know is a nikon/canon expert??! > i will now search this forum and find a method to dry clean my sensor myself, and subsequently decide further actions\u2026i need to go shooting rather than writing. i have 15 years of experience with technical service, and to me this is a very inconsistent performance by leica \u2013 both in terms of communication and actions. so, my question: is there any learning for leica here \u2013 and could we give them some constructive feedback and ideas for improvement?

I go back to my days as a serious woodworker. Several years ago, my wife and I owned an antiques store, which she ran while I was out making money to support it. Occasionally, a chair, a table, or some other piece of furniture would need repair work before we could put it out on the floor for sale. When we first started in the business, we would hire that work done, but gradually, by observing the work of others, subscribing to a few publications, watching several DVDs (before YouTube), and with many hours of practice I gained the confidence needed to take on those repair projects myself. It was fun, and it gave me the opportunity to do something creative while \"saving\" money by not having to hire professionals to do the work. Before long, I convinced myself, and more importantly, my wife, that I should build a shop. I did, and then I picked up a few basic tools - mostly Craftsman hand tools and Black and Decker power tools, an inexpensive table saw, a simple band saw, and an old shop lathe for turning. All of those tools did the job they were supposed to do; I could saw a block of wood, shape it on the lathe, refine it with the hand tools, and eventually end up with a finished product that would serve as a replacement part for the broken one.

There is a new Sony 35mm FF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 stabilized lens that weighs just over 1,300g and I believe it takes a 2X extender, although that still needs to be confirmed. It is AF, so I don't think such lenses have to be enormous. With 35mm FF mirrorless, you will see that smaller lenses are possible because larger apertures will still focus well. That isn't and wasn't true with DSLRs. You could get to 560mm with some Canon cameras in a small package, but not 800mm. For example, there is a Canon 100-400 f/4.5-5.6L MKII lens that takes a 1.4X extender and AFes with Canon 1 series cameras, but you couldn't get a small 800mm equivalent. But 35mm FF mirrorless will allow focussing at smaller max apertures, (the new Sony A9 has not trouble with f/11 for example) so smaller lenses are quite possible. Yes, an 800 f/5.6 needs to be enormous, but you can add a good 2X tele extender to a 400 f/5.6 lens and get a lens quite similar in size to the Panny Leica 100-400. What you call really wide apertures (and here were are only talking about f/5.6) may not be needed for your work, but others do find them useful and some even for DOF purposes. I don't think you can speak for everyone who might use such lenses, so your proclamation that with high ISO and image stabilization such aperture are needed seems overly broad. Some might even care about diffraction and yes on a 20mp M4/3rds sensor you will have some effects of diffraction that might not matter to you, but may matter to others. So, your statement that wider apertures aren't needed may be strictly true, but that doesn't mean they aren't desirable at least in some cases. I still say choice in aperture is a good thing and I still find it odd that some cannot acknowledge that. You can shoot an f/5.6 lens at f/12 after all, so you do tradeoff size, weight, and price for the ability to choose aperture, but I see no reason to make the argument that choice in aperture is not a good thing. It strikes me as very much like, \"the lady doth protest too much.\" I am simply noting the tradeoffs that you cannot acknowledge them seems more than a bit defensive.

No, I think you made yourself clear, but I don't see how M4/3rds has more depth of field than is capable with 35mm FF in any of the shots you posted. The lion was shot at the 35mm FF equivalent of 800mm at f/16. You certainly can shoot that on a 35mm FF camera or an APS-C camera. The hyena and the snake are even at wider apertures. What about these shots can't be done on 35mm FF? I agree that shallow depth of field is often over used, and good composition is often under rated.

If you use lens with a given aperture on a medium, be it film or sensor, of a given sensitivity, the exposure will remain the same, regardless of the size of that medium. In other words, the aperture stays the same when you go to a smaller format, the focal length stays the same, the shutterspeed needed stays the same, the medium sensitivity stays the same, the only thing that changes is the angle of view. That was true of view cameras versus Leicas, of 6x9 versus 110, and it is still true. If you use an extender you are doing something totally different. You are increasing the focal length of the lens without increasing the size of the entrance pupil, which by simple math will decrease the aperture proportionally resulting in a needed increase in medium sensitivity or a slower shutterspeed to reach the same exposure. The F- number N, the focal length f and the diameter of the entrance pupil D. N=f/D. So you see that sensor format does not enter into the equation for aperture. An extender changes the focal length and the entrance pupil will remain the same, thus the aperture will change. Forget all that stuff about \"amount of light falling through the lens\". It has absolutely nothing to do with the extender versus crop situation, and only muddles everything up. See it this way: You have a certain amount of light falling through a window into a room onto a wall. Now does it make a difference to the brightness of the wall whether you take a piece of 1x1 meter or a piece of 10x10 centimeter? Clearly not, the brightness will be exactly the same, despite the small area receiving only a fraction of the light falling through the window. I am not wrong, you just are not listening to what I am saying and instead suggesting that I am saying something that I am not.

Since FF sensor has fatter pixels with better signal to noise ratio compared to MFT, the noise level on the final picture from both the sensors (FF@ 800 ISO and MFT@ 200 ISO)will be kind of similar. I am assuming similar advancement in sensor technology in both sensor sizes. Basically what I am pointing out is that there is no free lunch in MFT sensor with more densely packed pixels.However, the 400mm f/4 lens on FF has to be extremely good to be used with 2x extender projecting a much bigger image circle (compared to MFT's 400mm f/6.3 lens). This will force FF lens to be bigger in size. Basically, FF lens with extender is wasting it's bigger potential. In contrast, MFT lens is being used to it's full potential and can remain compact.This is where I think MFT has advantage. I stand to be corrected. The first point that you made is essentially one of the points I was trying to make. That is if an M4/3rds camera and a FF 35mm camera have the same technology, you can turn up the ISO 2 stops on the FF camera and shoot a lens that has a 2 stop slower aperture. The reason, however, is not because of fatter pixels but rather because the FF sensor if it has the same technology will have 4 times as many pixels and you can then downsize the image to a quarter of its captured size and it will be equal in size and noise to the M4/3rds image. I don't agree with your second point. Although any lens will need a 4 times larger image circle to cover FF 35mm than M4/3rds, at 400mm it does not require a large lens to cover the 43mm image circle needed for FF 35mm. For example, the Rodenstock 360mm f/9 APO-Ronar covers a 318mm image circle (over 7 times larger than in needed for FF 35mm) and weighs just 550g. Now of course large format lenses are different and they need a bellow, etc., but they demonstrate that large image circles at long focal lengths are easy to obtain. The much more difficult task for lens design at long focal lengths is create wider apertures and keep the size small. You can see the too with large format lenses. For example, the Rodenstock 360mm F/6.8 APO-Sironar-N weighs 1560g. That one stop in wider aperture basically triples the weight. I think we see the same thing when we compare the three mirrorless 100-400mm lenses. The Sony lens is a 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 and weighs 1395g. The Fuji lens is also a 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 lens and only covers the much smaller APS-C image circle. Yet is weighs only 20g lighter at 1375g. Both lenses are image stabilized and both claim 5-stop image stabilization. If image circle were central to lens size then you would think the Fuji would be much smaller compared to the Sony than it is. Interestingly, we can compare both of these lenses with the Panny/Leica 100-400 f/4-6.3. The Panny Leica weighs just 985g and only needs to cover the much smaller yet M4/3rds image circle, but is it the smaller image circle or the smaller max aperture at the long end that allows the Panny/Leica to be smaller? Both probably contribute some, but I am arguing the weight reduction is primarily about the slower max aperture at the long end (just like we see in comparing long LF lenses such as the APO-Ronar f/9 and the APO-Sironar-N f/6.8) and not very much about the smaller image circle.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/271863-wildlife-long-lenses-and-sensor-format/page/6/?tab=comments#comment-3268667", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "271863-wildlife-long-lenses-and-sensor-format", "result": true, "Selector": "i was trying to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "however, you can bump up the iso of ff sensor to 2 stops in order to keep the same shutterspeed as of mft+400mm f/6.3 lens. since ff sensor has fatter pixels with better signal to noise ratio compared to mft, the noise level on the final picture from both the sensors (ff@ 800 iso and mft@ 200 iso)will be kind of similar. i am assuming similar advancement in sensor technology in both sensor sizes. basically what i am pointing out is that there is no free lunch in mft sensor with more densely packed pixels.however, the 400mm f/4 lens on ff has to be extremely good to be used with 2x extender projecting a much bigger image circle (compared to mft's 400mm f/6.3 lens). this will force ff lens to be bigger in size. basically, ff lens with extender is wasting it's bigger potential. in contrast, mft lens is being used to it's full potential and can remain compact.this is where i think mft has advantage. i stand to be corrected. the first point that you made is essentially one of the points -----> i !!!  -----> was !!!  -----> trying !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!! . that is if an m4/3rds camera and a ff 35mm camera have the same technology, you can turn up the iso 2 stops on the ff camera and shoot a lens that has a 2 stop slower aperture. the reason, however, is not because of fatter pixels but rather because the ff sensor if it has the same technology will have 4 times as many pixels and you can then downsize the image to a quarter of its captured size and it will be equal in size and noise to the m4/3rds image. i don't agree with your second point. although any lens will need a 4 times larger image circle to cover ff 35mm than m4/3rds, at 400mm it does not require a large lens to cover the 43mm image circle needed for ff 35mm. for example, the rodenstock 360mm f/9 apo-ronar covers a 318mm image circle (over 7 times larger than in needed for ff 35mm) and weighs just 550g. now of course large format lenses are different and they need a bellow, etc., but they demonstrate that large image circles at long focal lengths are easy to obtain. the much more difficult task for lens design at long focal lengths is create wider apertures and keep the size small. you can see the too with large format lenses. for example, the rodenstock 360mm f/6.8 apo-sironar-n weighs 1560g. that one stop in wider aperture basically triples the weight. i think we see the same thing when we compare the three mirrorless 100-400mm lenses. the sony lens is a 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 and weighs 1395g. the fuji lens is also a 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 lens and only covers the much smaller aps-c image circle. yet is weighs only 20g lighter at 1375g. both lenses are image stabilized and both claim 5-stop image stabilization. if image circle were central to lens size then you would think the fuji would be much smaller compared to the sony than it is. interestingly, we can compare both of these lenses with the panny/leica 100-400 f/4-6.3. the panny leica weighs just 985g and only needs to cover the much smaller yet m4/3rds image circle, but is it the smaller image circle or the smaller max aperture at the long end that allows the panny/leica to be smaller? both probably contribute some, but i am arguing the weight reduction is primarily about the slower max aperture at the long end (just like we see in comparing long lf lenses such as the apo-ronar f/9 and the apo-sironar-n f/6.8) and not very much about the smaller image circle.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 92600, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "Steve Spencer", "date": "2017-05-04 23:37:00", "content": "What FF sensor has 80 MP?

On some of the issues: Lens: of the ones you mention, the 50mm Rodagon the enlarger lens is likely to be the best because of its flat field. I think the 60mm Companion S won't give you a 35mm full frame on the BEOON. White balance: I've only tried AWB. The Autograph LED light pad that I use costs about the same as the one you mention. It has a color temperature of 6500K (cool white). That might be better than 5400k, as I recall reading a recommendation to calibrate monitors to 6500K, if I am not mistaken. Not a good idea to use old fluorescent light boxes, except that could be okay for B&W negatives. Shielding the BEOON: I just make sure that no light is falling on the BEOON by closing the blinds on the window directly in front of it. Also, I place a black sheet on the free section of the light pad, but I didn't seen a difference whenever I forgot to do that. There's no need to put a cutout around the BEOON frame mask. Exposure: I've used autoexposure so far with the M9 and MM, now with the M10 I'll try matrix autoexposure for which you need to use Live View. Focus: with Live View and magnification focussing is easy, but I had no problem focussing with the BEOON loupe. Generally, once the BEOON is focussed there's no need to refocus.

However, both of the slides above were underexposed, particularly the portrait, and that I have adjusted somewhat. More generally, slides shot in bright, harsh light have high contrast and, if one was printing them using an internegative and, in the glory days, the Kodak dye transfer process, one would reduce the contrast. These days one can digitalize or scan and print digitally and according to someone who was one of the last dye transfer printers, Ctein, the results can be as good or better than dye transfer. The bottom line, for, me is that the color slides I've digitalized here look much more like the slides themselves than the look I get out of the M10. To get close to the same look in shooting directly wit the M10 would require a good amount of skill and a lot of adjustment.

On results of using the BEOON with the M10 and the Focotar 2, and on digitalizing transparency film, see this thread. Owing to increasing demand, BEOONs are increasingly difficult to find, but you could still be happy with units that are not complete \u2014 and, while the BEOON is sturdy and little can go wrong, there are still some things that you need to watch for when you buy. 1. There is no need for the box or the manual (available online). 2. If your camera has Live View, you don't need the loupe, which some units are missing. Focussing is easier with Live View, but the loupe works well if you're using, say, an M9 or MM on the BEOON. 3. As the BEOON is practical only for 35 mm film you only need the 1:1 mask \u2014 no problem if the other masks are missing. However, you need to make sure that the 1:1 mask is not twisted or bent and that it fits onto the base without movement or looseness in any direction; otherwise you won't have good alignment with the camera sensor and the digitalizations will be skewed. 4. The hole in the base into which the pin of the mask fits should not be enlarged. Last year I picked up a BEOON from a dealer in which the hole was enlarged and had to return the unit because it was impossible to make a scan that wasn't skewed because the position of the mask was never in proper alignment with the camera's sensor. 5. On the other hand, if the M-mount on top of the BEOON is skewed it can be aligned properly by unscrewing three tiny screws and rotating the mount until the camera bottom is parallel to the white spots on the top part of the BEOON; the manual describes how to do this, but, confusingly, it's in the section on LTM cameras. I had this issue with my second BEOON but, amazingly, managed to get the correct position on the first try. As for the lens to use, the manual states that any 50 mm lens will work. Originally, last year I started using the DR Summicron-50. Then, on someone's recommendation, I bought a Focotar 2 enlarging lens; but, not having done any rigorous testing, couldn't see a difference in the rough type of Tri-X shots I was making, in which softness in the corners did not matter.

On comparison to scanning with scanners, I have only compared scanning several B&W negatives at full resolution (6300ppi) on my Imacon Precision III vs. camera scanning with the M-Monochrom, which I no longer have. The results were of equal quality, meaning that the Imacon files were a bit larger, but I couldn't see a difference at 100% in either resolution or dMax. As I didn't keep these tests, I cannot show the results. For scanning transparency film, unfortunately I have to let the results shown above speak for themselves, as I have no direct comparison: all I can say is that I scanned Kodachrome and Ektachrome slides some years ago with the same Imacon and that the full resolution scans took some 12 min because of the SCSI interface, and, as stated above, required substantially more post-processing than my camera scans with the M10. On the need for a film strip holder for the BEOON, I don't feel it is necessary. The BEOON base has cutouts for 35mm film of both sides. I find it fast and easy to move from frame to frame and to line up the frame in the 1:1 BEOON masks, which is what I presume you call the Rube Goldberg aspect. The reality, for me, is that the surface of the Artograph Lightpad that I'm using is so smooth that I have no difficulty moving the film strip nor any risk of scratching it \u2014 this surface is also not a dust magnet. Clearly, though, the BEOON is not a solution for medium format film. My experience with the Imacon is a long saga with an unhappy ending. Not having used it since 2005, in December 2016, in three 10-hour days, I managed to get the old OS X 10.6.8 installed on an old Mac PowerBook to run the (legacy) Imacon ColorFlex 4.04 software and got the SCSI-to-FireWire Orange Converter and Granite (power) SCSI Terminator going so that all this works \u2014 only to learn, on the third full day of my effort, that this scanner was losing sharpness at the trailing end of the 35mm frame (as the negative is fed into the scanner in portrait orientation). Further research showed that Imacon scanners require periodic maintenance fairly often. After some hours of searching the web, I found out that the cause of the sharpness loss is slippage of the belts that drive the holder mechanism. I had to replace these belts and some springs. Although, apparently, I can buy the belts and springs in the US or the UK at about US$5\u201310 each, I gave up because these scanners often require belt replacement every six months or so. The belt problem also makes the film frame shift in the holder as it goes into the scanner, so that a small portion of the scan is often cut off. I now remember from ten years ago that I often had this problem, but didn't know there was a solution. By the way, there is no batch feed solution for this scanner \u2014 and one full res (6300 ppi) 35mm scan takes 12\u201315 minutes. As I didn't want to make a career out of the care and feeding of this Imacon scanner, I decided to dump it. I couldn't sell it with a good conscience. Basically, even if I was prepared spent $14,000 on a new Hasselblad X1 \u2014 same 6300dpi resolution as my Imacon but twice the speed \u2014 I don\u2019t think it would make sense because I don\u2019t think the drive mechanism on the new scanners has changed. That means, in my view, that these Hasselblad scanners only make sense (beyond the price issue) in a photo lab environment, where they can be serviced and maintained regularly. The choice, then was a Plustek or other scanner still produced, as I didn't wand to get into legacy systems. But the Plustek has a dMax of only 3.6, which wasn't enough for my slides. I had no interest in the Pakon, which is not only was a legacy machine, but also was designed with small prints in mind. _________________ Alone in Bangkok essay on BURN Magazine Edited September 5, 2017 by Nowhereman", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/276485-film-scanners/?tab=comments#comment-3352299", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "276485-film-scanners", "result": true, "Selector": "i have made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "plasticman - -----> i !!!

How long are the scan times? I'm currently scanning 120 film. My workflow is to preview at 667dpi and then scan at 2000dpi. From pressing the Preview button until complete takes 1 min 8 sec. The scan, without multi-sampling or fine mode, takes 1 min 56 sec. It will take longer at a higher dpi but I rarely scan above 2000 dpi. About over-exposed negatives, I will add a resounding yes, that's bloody annoying. I have this with Ektar 120 film, which I have only recently begun to shoot. Weirdly I have not had it with any other 120 (or 135) film I have shot. I recently posted about it in the I like film thread and also received help over at APUG. Yesterday and today I made masks from an opaque plastic sheet but this still does not completely deal with the problem. It can be addressed a bit in post (I use ACR) or by cropping but the latter sucks if I've composed a shot like I want it in-camera. I hope it works out for you. I'd be happy to troubleshoot the speed and quality issues you see. Also, out of curiosity, it would be interesting to see comparisons of how much better quality SF gives compared with Vuescan. Bestphilip A year later and a new update: Vuescan problems have continued to bother me - very long scan times (especially on batch scans, so probably poor memory management in the application), and also disappointing results when trying to scan over-exposed negatives. I'm testing the Silverfast trial again - and this time I decided to just stick with testing for as long as I can bear it. Every time I've tested it before, the interface has given me too many headaches to persist for more than a dozen scans. The short story is that I'll probably be buying Silverfast, after all. The scans are orders of magnitude faster, and the results are simply better straight out of the scanner. There are some small problems I'm debating with myself about, but I'm reluctantly leaning towards the change. In the end the largest drawback is the horrible licensing and hefty price tag - looking back over this thread it seems I decided against buying SF when it cost \u20ac340. Now it costs \u20ac450.

Below is what I think I need; --img-- Enlarger.JPG There are other items like these but have no idea if I need them or not?? --img-- Extras.JPG Thanks Neil Neil, I never used a Beseler 45, therefore, I cannot comment on it specifically. I used Beseler for 35mm and Omega for 4x5. A few general comments. 1. You do not need to start with an alignment tool. You can wait and buy it if you need it, unless the Beseler is impossible to align out of the box. This could be if you mount on the wall, with which I have no experience. 2. If you use a cold light head, you will need a stabilizer of some kind. This keeps your light output constant and and the cold light at operating temperature when you are not printing. Without a stabilizer, there is no way that I know for you to maintain consistency. 3. I have used both condenser and cold light. I prefer cold light. A condenser head produces a lot of heat (assuming light source technology has not improved to reduce heat substantially). Heat plus longer exposures can cause a negative to \"pop\", resulting in movement. You can compensate for this by using glass negative carriers, however, this causes additional surfaces that must be kept clean and dust-free. Jesse The alignment tool could be useful but it's not an everyday item (I haven't used the Versalab tool but another make [Rodenstock]). Once set up, the enlarger should stay in alignment although you may find slight differences when the head is at the top or bottom of the column owing to flexing where the column joins the baseboard. If you want to do big prints (say 30x40 in), then you'll need to wall-mount the column and make sure the head is a sufficient distance from the wall (at least half the width of the print plus the width of the frame you're holding the paper down with). For more normal print sizes, put a table underneath the enlarger - and make sure it's aligned properly. There are 'freestanding' / 'floorstanding' enlargers (e.g. De Vere) which will print at any size up to 30x40 in, though you'll need to fix the top of the column to the wall to maintain rigidity. If you want to go larger than 30x40 in with paper intended for wet processing, then horizontal projection is the more practical choice - but then you've got to consider how to handle the paper during processing and drying. A more general point: Make sure the darkroom floor (and walls, if you're wall-mounting the enlarger) are fairly 'solid' and there's no heavy traffic or machinery likely to cause vibration.

Well after years of interest and a few months of research, i finally took the leica dive... Have been shooting fuji (xt1 and xpro1) for years and will definitely keep them as the fuji experience is also quite unique in other ways. The gear: bought 3 lenses (to make a long story short, wanted to buy one but saw the seller had 2 others, basically new in plastic and boxes). 35 summicron type iv and 2 elmarits (90 and 21 asph). Got the lenses first, my intention was to adapt them on the xpro. Then, i made the mistake of handlin a m9. Ouf, what a solid well made instrument. It was downhill from there.

If the scanning workflow is not done properly you will loose all the quality of a 4x5 negative (or positive). the tonality, details, sharpness, etc. would be lost. Shooting with a 4x5 is a lot of effort in terms of time, inconvenience of the weight and size of the gear, cost (film, developing, printing, etc.), that saving on the scanning doesn't make a lot of sense. It's like buying a Phase 1 with 100 mb pixel and then using it in a crop mode with 10 megapixel... With all respect, the scanned negative that you posted above lacks contrast, it lacks details, it has light leaks, it has dust and scratches and a bunch of other stuff going on. Some of them is due to the shooting technique, others most likely due to the scanning not well done. Welcome to the club of the 4x5 shooters where we all do mistakes at the beginning of our long uphill journey... but there will be a lot of rewards down the road... --img--  all the best, Lorenzo Thanks, Lorenzo - the photo which I posted above is my first 4x5 negative which I shot. As you pointed out, I made a few first timer errors there - the main one already happened when I pushed the 4x5 film into the film holder the first time. The film must have caught the wrong rail at the end of the insertion, and when I closed the lid, the film must have been pushed backwards by the lid. Therefore I lost about 20% of the frame in my composition shown above (on the right side) which was never exposed. Likely due to the incorrect film insertion I also got a small light leak on the negative which is seen as brighter area on the lower left. The inconsistent sky pattern on top of the frame could have been caused during my tray development process where I might have grabbed the border of the negative to turn it around several times (with nitrile gloves used). Last but not least I overexposed one stop from the measured indirect metering which proved to be beneficial on 35 mm film, but wasn't the right thing here on 4x5 - the negative is slightly overexposed and lacks some contrast. Digitizing-wise, the dust particles were brought into the picture but otherwise it was the negative as it is. The lack of details is caused by the lower contrast in the negative and because I downsized it for web viewing purposes.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/269675-digitizing-4x5-negatives/?tab=comments#comment-3220142", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "269675-digitizing-4x5-negatives", "result": false, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "as you pointed out, i made a few first timer errors there - the main one already happened when i pushed the 4x5 -----> film !!!  into the -----> film !!!  holder the first time.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 103679, "year": "2017"}, {"autor": "Jeff S", "date": "2017-08-23 13:46:00", "content": "The best way to learn is to make careful tests using your own gear.

Make sure that your reels are 100% dry. Thumbs placed at the 'entrance' to the reel will help guide the film, and also let you know if it has jumped the track. Different films curl to a different degree. Rollei 25 uses genetic material from Shirley Temple's hair. A path used by some is to reverse load it on a developing tank reel after processing (I haven't tried this - I just put up with its manic foetal memory). For most films, hanging them to dry with a (small) weight on the bottom is sufficient to get them flat enough to handle. Keep going! As pointed out by EoinC, film loading depends a lot on the kind of film which is used. I am using the Paterson system to load the 35 mm film. I made very good experience to load HP5+ 400 film onto the reel because it is thinner than the Kodak films and more flexible to roll. This credit comes with the debit that it can also be bent more easily and showing bend marks in the final negative if not loaded correctly. Kodak films can be more tricky to load - worst I had was the Kodak Gold 200 film (I used an expired roll which still provided excellent image quality). It rolled severely from its landscape orientation sides, and so far it was the only film which I developed which did not straighten out by handing weights on the film end when drying. I had to cut the film and press it between a glass plate and several books on top of it to be able to finally scan it. In general the Paterson reels are easy to load the film at the beginning, but it gets harder to wind it closer to its end. Normally it always jumps out of one track, so I need to get it on the track in darkness just by feeling again which can take a couple of minutes. In the worst case, I have to open the reel and start rolling the film from beginning. Sometimes I just leave the last few negatives unrolled and carefully place the reel with center pole into the tank. I did not make good experience with the Kalt steel rolls. Thinner film was cut by the spring loader at the beginning. I also find it much harder to control if the film is winded up correctly on these sort of reels because you might easily jump over one reel winding. Tried it a few times and decided now to stick to the Paterson system.
