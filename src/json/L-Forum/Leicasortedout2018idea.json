This is a deep and profound question, and deserves thought, rather than the usual reaction. Any change in technology changes the economics, and one's personnel views are seldom relevant. A truth seldom acknowledged is that if one wish's to stay au courant with Leica models then you are following a variation on a leasing model. If you went M8 M9 M240 , M10 , then roughly every three years you may have traded in one camera and acquired the new model. This works out at a roughly \u00a3700 a year subscription. (\u00a35000 for the new body, three years later trade in say \u00a33000 =s \u00a3666ish). This is an informal subscription model. Of course you can change the numbers by keeping the camera, changing the time periods but every time you sell a digital Leica to buy a new one you are into informal \u2018 leasing. The pedants will quibble over my use of language but at 50,000 feet this is the correct view. This was not true in film days as a Leica M7 gave you no technical image quality improvement over an older M3. Moore\u2019s law (predicted to end soon but as yet still going ) implies we will continue to see some significant technical improvements to digital photography for a while. As the tech gets increasingly homogenised, there is little major difference in pictorial out put between major brands. Yes one has personal preferences I do for Leica but I understand this is my personal/emotional choice, I shoot with a lot of cameras and note that my images are boringly similar regardless of the camera I use. Many will respond with assorted flavours of 'the only way you will get me to give up my Leica is to prize it from cold dead hands', but this is emotional, religious, personnel preference, and ignores the macro economic forces affecting any model in a market. Which in this case is that for major brand facing constant technical change then the subscription model has an appeal, as it is a more formal way of locking you into the brand. After all as lenses become more interchangeable across mirrorless platforms, it becomes easier to swap platforms. Leica SL to Sony A7 to Z7 or what ever. Yes there is the issue that things work less than perfectly when they are not native to the platform , but this gets less at each iteration. There fore, the strategic question becomes how do the digital product corporations, ( of which Leica is now a very minor one ) lock us into brand. This is the essential issue in the IoS V Android wars. Don\u2019t kid yourself, at Blackstone or who ever the current owner is , Leica is not a camera it is a brand. The product in this case for image recording is merely the tools of the brand. I know this is deeply unpalatable but it is a crucial factor in the digital world. As digit products become more ephemeral the brand needs to seem more solid. So it makes sense for me to pay Leica \u00a35000, for the a body then pay \u00a3750 a year to be upgraded for ever.

It's a fantastic idea, make the kids think about what they want before they press the shutter, not see what they can conjure up in Lightroom days later.

I think you need practical help from someone near you. If you are new to developing film, you are also new to judging the outcome. Of course Adan here is right: just shoot another film at home and develop half of that film. When the film is dry you need to decide how good it is and I think this is where you should involve someone with experience. There are so many factors to consider. Best would be to then make (or have them made) a couple of small prints. Too hard, too soft? Lighter along the edges, so many things you can see right away . . . then, if you can improve, you develop the second half of the test roll and make adjustments (agitate more, or less, develop longer, or shorter, etc). After that you will have a much better idea how to develop the important bunch of films. Still, starting out I would use a single film tank first. When it goes well you can do more films at the time . . .", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/287595-now-what/?tab=comments#comment-3574528", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "287595-now-what", "result": false, "Selector": "[idea, develop]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "after that you will have a much better idea how to develop the important bunch of -----> films !!! .", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105616, "year": "2018"}], "name": "Leicasortedout2018idea"}
