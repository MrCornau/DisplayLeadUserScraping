I realize that Monochrom Type I users are a minority within a minority of Leica photographers. It's not a camera for the general public, or even Leica fans at large, hence Leica sees no profit in CCD sensors. Leica (like all business enterprises) follows the money. We (MMI shooters) see what we see - even when others don't see. Stefan Daniel recently said this about CCD technology and rendering when recently interviewed for the 10 year anniversary of the M9 (Google translation)... \u201cIn 2009, CMOS sensors had already begun to take precedence over CCDs. Why still opt for CCD technology, and why at Kodak in particular? [Laughs] That's pretty funny because today I still get requests for a new M with a CCD. Some photographers seem to like, and regret, the rendering of the CCD. But as for why we stayed on CCD in the M9, it's very simple: Kodak, at that time, was the only company that wanted to customize a sensor with the network of micro-lenses that we had designed. So, the choice was quickly made since it was the only one. In any case, even in 2019, I'm sure that if we released a Leica M CCD sensor, it would sell to some fans of the CCD look. But it's not in the program and, in any case, technology no longer exists.Finally, it has not completely disappeared, since it is still used in some industrial sensors, but for photography, the CCD has completely disappeared. In any case, today, this technology would have no interest compared to CMOS. Most importantly, it is the image processing algorithms that have the most influence on color rendering than the sensor technology itself. It also depends on the photographer's eye and some placebo effect. I'm sure if today we were doing a blind test between two images taken with a CCD and a CMOS, most people who would see these images can not say which one corresponds to which sensor. In my opinion, it is more a story of image processing than technology.\u201d https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=fr&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://mizuwari.fr/index.php/2019/09/09/le-leica-m9-a-dix-ans-entretien-avec-stefan-daniel-pere-du-premier-hybride-24-x-36-mm/&xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265&usg=ALkJrhiyb6JjbH47lU-OAfztxN44T2T1Bw", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/281741-m10m-will-have-what/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-3825122", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "281741-m10m-will-have-what", "result": true, "Selector": "we had designed", "selectorShort": "design", "MarkedSent": "on 9/9/2019 at 12:30 pm, wilfredo said: even after post processing with silver efex pro, i was not satisfied. i realize that monochrom type i users are a minority within a minority of leica photographers. it's not a camera for the general public, or even leica fans at large, hence leica sees no profit in ccd sensors. leica (like all business enterprises) follows the money. we (mmi shooters) see what we see - even when others don't see. stefan daniel recently said this about ccd technology and rendering when recently interviewed for the 10 year anniversary of the m9 (google translation)... \u201cin 2009, cmos sensors had already begun to take precedence over ccds. why still opt for ccd technology, and why at kodak in particular?

(S-R70200) and LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. (S-R24105) Panasonic is proud to introduce three new interchangeable lenses based on the L-Mount system for the LUMIX S Series Full-frame Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera. Specially focusing on professional use, the LUMIX S Series pursues uncompromising photographic expression with its high-quality cameras and lenses. LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 (S-X50) A large-aperture fixed focal length lens that forms the core of the LUMIX S Series of lenses LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. (S-R70200) A telephoto zoom lens that features high resolution with stunning clarity across the entire zoom range LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. (S-R24105) A versatile standard zoom lens with macro shot capability covering wide-angle to medium telephoto The L-Mount is a lens mount for mirrorless cameras that was launched by Leica and is equally suitable for both the APS-C format and full-frame cameras. Leica Camera, Panasonic and Sigma are set to offer a user-friendly solution that will allow photographers to \u2018mix and match\u2019 any of the three manufacturers\u2019 APS-C and full-frame cameras with any lens from each other\u2019s product portfolios. The aim of the L-Mount Alliance is to provide customers with a diverse and future-proof range of products. The advantages are a large inner diameter of 51.6 mm that enables the realization of extremely fast lenses and extremely compact dimensions. The configuration of the lens-to-camera communication interface is future-proof and the L-Mount also offers an option for the construction of sealed systems that are insensitive to dust and moisture. The L-Mount thereby opens up an almost limitless spectrum of new creative possibilities. All interchangeable lenses of the LUMIX S Series provide high performance yet the \u201cLUMIX S PRO\u201d lenses further boast ultimate optical performance to be certified by LEICA for clearing stringent LEICA standards. Panasonic is committed to designing and developing 10 or more lenses with a focus on \u201cLUMIX S PRO\u201d lenses by 2020 and further expanding the S Series lens lineup. LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 (S-X50) The LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 is a large-aperture fixed focal length LUMIX S PRO lens that nucleates all LUMIX S Series lenses. Ensuring versatile use with its 50mm focal length and F1.4 high speed, the LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 boasts stunningly high resolution and a descriptive performance from the center to the corners of the image despite its large aperture. It provides smooth defocus gradation from the focus peak to the neighboring area of the image. It also describes the point light sources in the background as impressive, beautiful bokeh. The optical performance of this LUMIX S PRO lens is outstandingly high to clear stringent LEICA standards. Comprising 13 lenses in 11 groups, the use of 2 aspherical lenses and 3 ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lenses effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Astigmatism is also corrected with those aspherical lenses, achieving high resolving performance. A double focus system combining a linear motor and stepping motor achieves sensor drive at a maximum speed of 480 fps. It realizes fast, high-precision AF to ensure that you will never miss a photo opportunity. Adoption of a focus clutch mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 also excels in video recording performance with a mechanism that suppresses focus breathing, which was a fatal problem of all interchangeable lenses designed for still image photography. The refined design of the LUMIX S Series provides high operability as a tool for professionals. The rugged dust/splash-resistant* design withstand use under harsh conditions even in 10 degrees below zero for high mobility. The filter diameter is 77mm, with an 11-blade circular aperture diaphragm. *Dust and Splash Resistant does not guarantee that damage will not occur if this lens is subjected to direct contact with dust and water. LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. (S-R70200) The second lens is also a LUMIX S PRO lens. The LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. telephoto zoom lens provides high-resolution, high-contrast images across the entire zoom range. It can be used for wide-ranging situations, from portraits to sports. Panasonic LUMIX\u2019s image stabilization system 5-Axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabilzier) 2*1 can be used with the LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. for the first time as a lens of a full-frame mirrorless camera system, to ensure that you will never miss a photo opportunity. The optical performance of this LUMIX S PRO lens is outstandingly high to clear stringent LEICA standards. The lens unit comprises 23 lenses in 17 groups and the use of an aspherical lens and 3 ED (Extra- low Dispersion) lenses effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Designed in pursuit of optimum lens alignment, it achieves beautiful bokeh with minimum vignetting. The O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) in the lens effectively compensates for the hand-shake movement, making it easy to shoot even without a tripod or in low-lit situations. Complying with the camera\u2019s Body I.S., the 5-Axis Dual I.S. 2*1 makes it possible to use 6-stop slower shutter speed*2. The high-precision linear motor achieves sensor drive at a maximum speed of 480 fps for fast auto focusing.
