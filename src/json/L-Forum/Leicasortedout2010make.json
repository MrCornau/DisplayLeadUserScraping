It is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. It is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. That's all. So Jamie - this is the explanation I posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. As adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. You will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (A) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. A) is the focus throw adjustment. If you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. If you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. As you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. By moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you INCREASE the total available focus throw. By moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you DECREASE the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. Right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. From my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) Infinity is very important. Step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today I've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. Don't accept the nonesense I was spouting before about it not mattering. It really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) Now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. I found text to be excellent. Note whether you now have front focus or back focus. If you have front focus (like I did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. So you need to shorten the arm by loosening (A) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise. (If you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) Now, recheck infinity. It will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. But this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) Repeat step 2. You will see that the focus point has altered. Whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general I made positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) When you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. On my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) I did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. When my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range. I suppose that if this were not the case or if your lenses varied then you'd need to get them recalibrated, or maybe accept a compromise setting. Hope that's helpful.

What an excellent tool. You don't NEED it of course, but it would be lovely to have it. So, in my case I spend many tens of hours deducing how it all works, gradually, even publishing my errors along the way and getting help wherever I can and then, safe in the knowledge that I understand it I made some posts backing everything up with evidence. You, on the other hand see a PHOTOGRAPH YOU CAN JUST MAKE OUT and then attempt to advise with the following: There are three points of adjustment in that arm WRONG That hole takes a bending tool, to bend the arm WRONG - It's the adjustment tool to allow you to hold the arm easier. and bend for intermediate. WRONG - You tell me I'm misadvising - this is the funniest thing I've read for a while! You'll find the special \"bending tool\" there as well. WRONG - No bending here mate. And my own, very special favourite Jaap is this: In a small way you are right, the bending is the setting that is rarely off in cameras that leave the factory and is the least likely to go out of adjustment So, there is no bending tool and yet you KNOW that this adjustment is rarely off, and is not likely to go out of adjustment. Just how on the Lord's earth can you know that, since this is an adjustment that you have made up in your own mind. Quite simply you have fabricated the whole bending thing because you've seen the adjustment tool that has now been correctly identified and you've decided to try and have the last word on it by making up the idea that bending your camera arm would affect your close focus. The only thing that trying to bend that arm would affect would be your warranty, mate, when it snaps straight off ! It's unbelievable Jaap. So if you really are: concerned about unsuspecting readers following your example, completely throwing their rangefinder out of whack and voiding their guaranty in the process. Then you'll obviously want to set the record straight and admit straight out that you've been talking unsubstantiated nonsense and that nobody, ever, should want to try and bend their camera. That in fact you've misunderstood and you understand now that there are only 2 adjustments - length of arm and eccentric roller cam position, and that you confess to making up the third adjustment solely to make yourself look dead clever. Adjusting the rangefinder is no more dangerous or difficult than adjusting a derailleur gear set on a bike - you either understand what the screws do or you don't - there is no middle ground. And the adjustment is self checking - it either works and is in focus on your photographs or it's not - Like the gears - they either change smoothly and have the right end points, and don't jump between gears or they don't. Saying that an unsuspecting owner could put 'everything' out of whack is only like messing up the screws on the gear set. You just tweak them back in once you understand it - no biggie. Or maybe you know of a secret bending tool that you use to do the gears on your bike as well eh? Honestly I don't mean to sound harsh but the scale of the nonsense here Jaap is absolutely incredible and you need to deal with it.

Peter, I have posted this before some years ago but I think it is appropriate to post it again here. I bought a rechargeable 2CR5 lithium battery kit, with external charger for an old Canon P&S that had been passed on to my son, where I was fed up with buying my son the quite expensive non-rechargeable 2CR5 batteries. It worked for about 6 cycles and then the battery self destructed inside the camera with lots of smoke. Amazingly, after we had scraped the melted remnants out of the battery compartment and inserted a regular non-rechargeable lithium battery in the camera, it still worked. However, that is not something that is likely to happen with the plastic surround on an M8 or M9 (the Canon's battery compartment was metal lined). I will never take the risk again of buying non-original-manufacturer batteries for any of our cameras. For what you save, the risk just does not add up, although I accept that in the years since this incident, lithium batteries may have become safer. Fake batteries are also an issue. I bought last year on Amazon marketplace, a Sony branded battery for my wife's TG3 video camera. It lasted about half as long as the original battery, even after a number of \"forming\" charges. It was somewhat cheap in comparison to other sellers. It turned out that Amazon had subsequently received a number of complaints on this seller and arranged a refund for me.
