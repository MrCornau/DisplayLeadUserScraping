None with a rangefinder but I promise to start trying on my next assignments. I said start trying (which means 3rd camera). I'm not sure where you are going with all your explanations. I had no trouble being unnoticed with my huge DSLR artillery. My lenses are the Noct, 28 1.4, more primes and Zooms. No telephotos, and no scared people. No scared children as you intended. No scared adults. Everyone looks normal. And the mirror slap is fast enough not to miss the action during Blackout. Like the yawning child. So no need for a rangefinder to get all the action in the viewfinder. Let's not lie to ourselves; The decisive moment is exactly the same with any camera. Really, it's just a matter of being confortable. You certainly won't make me change ideas about how a Rangefinder is best and yet, I respect rangefinder wedding shooters. --img--  --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/56314-m8-pro-wedding-photography/page/6/?tab=comments#comment-598949", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "56314-m8-pro-wedding-photography", "result": true, "Selector": "[ideas, make]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "Riccis, I remember you once asked to see some of my wedding work at another forum...
