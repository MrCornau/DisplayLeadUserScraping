I was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. I put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of positions by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so I bit. Shooting Leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and I have shot with every mainline production M I can think of, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M4-2, M4-P, M6, M6TTL, M7, MP, M-A, M8, M8.2, M9P, Monochrom, M-P240, M246, and M262. Still, the screen-less Leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. I have had the chance to shoot my M-D for one day at Universal Studios Hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in Orlando, Florida. During this time, I averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. I shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. I attached the new 35mm/2.0/ASPH/II lens and an E39 UVa and didn\u2019t look back. The camera shoots like an M7. It meters like an M7, focuses like an M7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that I developed with my M7. The big difference is not the extra depth, which is truly minimal, but rather the adjustable ISO dial on the back, which you don\u2019t get to leverage on an M7 without changing rolls of film. Having any speed film from 200-6400 ISO at the twist of a dial is very handy. The rest of the body works like an M7, and the bump on the back of the top plate holds your thumb very much like a film winding lever. All in all, an excellent handling design. O.K., there is one tiny new item I need to train myself on, that is the use of the function button and rear control thumb wheel to adjust exposure compensation. Luckily the meter is good enough you don\u2019t need to use it often. The shutter sound is discrete like an M should be, very much like the one in the M262, which has the current best M digital shutter. Several aspects of performance warrant discussion. First and foremost, the image quality is every bit as good as any of the other \u2018240 class cameras. The default compressed DNG files are superb and offer lots of flexibility for image editing. The second area worth note is the metering. The pattern used is the \u2018240-series \u201cClassic\u201d pattern, which uses reflections off of the central blades of the shutter curtain. Metering reflected off of curtain works very well and quickly, although the metering can occasionally be fooled by high or low-key lighting. The solution is what I term, \u201cnodding the camera\u201d. You simply point the camera down for lower shutter speeds, up for higher shutter speeds, then hold the exposure with a half-press of the shutter release and recompose your final shot. Using this approach, I achieved exposures that were around \u00bd stop underexposed 98-99% of the time. The slight underexposure is perfect for ensuring you don\u2019t blow out your highlights, and the dynamic range of the sensor and resultant files pulls the details out of the rest of the image and the shadows without issue. The continuous burst buffer is good for 10 shots in a sequence. Battery consumption hovered around 15% per day for an average 150 photos, which extrapolates to 1000 photos on a full charge. These numbers were achieved by turning the camera off between periods of use. I did confirm the hard way, however, that the camera does not have an auto-off, and I would up with a dead battery one morning. I would recommend having a spare charged battery readily available in case you make a similar mistake. The M-D comes with a hard black paint finish over brass. I would have preferred a silver chrome version, and may pick one up in the future if offered, but the black paint chosen for the current version is very durable, with no signs of wear after 9 days in busy amusement parks. This is no MP black lacquer, and your camera will not resemble the Kravitz \u2018240 for quite a long time of use. Other than the aforementioned dead battery, the camera was 100% reliable, with no crashes or hang-ups. It wrote every single image I took to SD card without error, something no other M digital I have owned can claim. It really is that good. If I were to make two changes, I would add silver chrome as an option for the top and bottom plates and hardware, and maybe a two-position on/off switch versus the current Off/S/C/Timer. I did overachieve and put the camera into Continuous mode when I wanted Single, but no harm came, and no images or opportunities were lost. Oh, and did I mention it had the cleanest sensor straight out of the box of the 11 digital Ms I\u2019ve purchased since 2006? Not a speck of dust! I did have the chance to share the camera over lunch with a friend named Kevin who has made a career out of photography. He loves his M\u2019s, but also shoots a lot of Canons for digital stills, and other gear for video. I explained the philosophy behind the camera as a reliable tool where you stay focused on your subject and environment to be ready for the next shot, not reviewing the past image. I caught him chimping the ISO dial a few times, and when I commented he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right, this will take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a good thing, and I need to get me one of these (M-D).\u201d Kevin supervises a number of other photography professionals, and I would not be surprised to see their department adopting a no-screen shooters challenge as a way of capturing more \u201cdecisive moment\u201d images. This, of course, requires equipment that is 100% reliable and predictable, and photographers with the skills to make the most out of the equipment on every image. The M-D is up to the task. So, who should buy this camera? This is a little bit hard to define. The camera is ultra-reliable, produces excellent images, and is totally predictable. It should be durable enough to last for decades. I would expect the batteries and SD cards will be the lifespan-limiting commodities, not the M-D. If you want a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d Leica M digital for still images only, and have at least some skill with M cameras, this is an excellent selection, and could be your only M. If you need to work at the limits of M capabilities, lenses wider than 28 or longer than 90 (subjective), shoot macro, hold cameras overhead or away from your eye for perspective or safety,, shoot at f/0.95, or need to capture short video clips, then a \u2018240 may be a better tool, but don\u2019t forget the lessons the M-D and prior film M cameras teach us.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/261262-a-few-comments-based-upon-two-outings-with-the-leica-m-d-type-262-camera/?tab=comments#comment-3056848", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "261262-a-few-comments-based-upon-two-outings-with-the-leica-m-d-type-262-camera", "result": true, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": " leica has created a digital version of their m7 film offering. i was fortunate enough to purchase one of these cameras three weeks ago. i put my name on the local wait list even before the camera was announced, but was bumped a couple of positions by higher-priority customers and saw the opportunity to have a camera in hand in time for a planned vacation, so i bit. shooting leicas is a major entertainment outlet for me, and i have shot with every mainline production m i can think of, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m4-2, m4-p, m6, m6ttl, m7, mp, m-a, m8, m8.2, m9p, monochrom, m-p240, m246, and m262. still, the screen-less leica digital sounded like loads of fun, and did not disappoint. i have had the chance to shoot my m-d for one day at universal studios hollywood and for 8 days in the various attractions in orlando, florida. during this time, i averaged 150 frames per day, for a total of just under 1400 images. i shot the camera \u201cnaked\u201d of any case or protector for the minimum bulk. i attached the new 35mm/2.0/asph/ii lens and an e39 uva and didn\u2019t look back. the camera shoots like an m7. it meters like an m7, focuses like an m7, and uses the same muscle memories for the on/off switch that -----> i !!!

It did and it didn't. My developer was fresh and I used the maximum dilution of this anti fog stuff. I first printed from an Agfa Record Rapid 30X40 envelope graded hard.

I developed with again that same light only. The print was totally soft and the white edges around the images were totally medium grey. I ditched that envelope. Then I took a same grade hard sheet from a 50X60 envelope, cut it in half and tested, plus made a print. No problems with the white around the image, but the print was still much too soft. I then switched to Ilford Warmtone multigrade and got the perfect print easily. I am keeping this envelope Record Rapid (and about 10 others) and will try again with more contrasty negatives. So, there are two basic problems when doing this: first the problem of the paper turning grey, instead of remaining white in unexposed parts. I know I could not have made my darkroom any darker, it was almost like working in the full dark. I used a late model Leitz easel and this one really does cover the paper under the blades, etc. The sides of my first print's paper were evenly grey. I believe no anti fog stuff can help there.

FP4+ is an old school cubical type emulsion. Very good results you can have with ID11/D76. With R09/Rodinal you will loose some film speed but you will have crisp negatives with high acutance. However in 35mm it is already pretty grainy. Cubical type films are also more forgiving in a bit wrong exposure. The rest is also a matter of taste. I can only suggest to start with one film (and one developer) and follow the manufacturer instructions so far. The last part and correction in printing will do the Split Grade system for you. However the way to a perfect print is starting with a good exposure and film development. I am already developing my films (and doing wet prints) over 50 years so in principle I can tell you that with every film and a suitable developer you can reach a good result. My favorites are the Fomapan 100-200 films. But also with OrWo Filmotec N74+ or Kodak 5222 Double-X (in principle cine films) you can have perfect prints. And if you like B&W slides you can reach with Rollei Retro 400(S) (an Agfa Gevaert aviation type emulsion) E.I. 125 a perfect result.

Get rid of it all! Thanks so much, this is very helpful advice! I saw that still some dye must have remained on my previously developed TMax 400 film - invisible to the eye, but when I photographed my negatives and then opened the RAW file in PS, I saw a slight reddish color tint (removed by conversion in B&W). The reddish tint did not come from the LED light panel which I used to illuminate the negatives to photograph them - I did the same development procedure on Tri-X film, and didn't see any reddish color tint in my photographed negatives. I suspect a little bit red leftover from the dye doesn't harm either.

It seems to me (and I realise these are internet jpgs) the scanner doesn't quite resolve the grain. In my humble experience, with Tri-X (edit: in 135) there will be grain. Sure it can be reduced by using different developers, but Tri-X won't look like fine-grained films. An interesting take. I do like grain but I think the grain on this particular image is too pronounced. Too contrasty. As you have suggested I have adjusted my scanning and found better settings. Once scanned I have found you can't play with the files like digital so I need to relearn my workflow to work more closely with my scanner.

And I apologise if my post appeared critical. I actually don't think the grain looks 'wrong' (and it is a nice photograph too btw). Personally I don't think there is a right or wrong when it comes to grain. It looks as it does for a number of reasons. Of course, how one wants an image to look is another matter and grain is an important part of a film image, particularly for small format film. I am not familiar with the V550 but in case it helps below are a few images scanned on my Coolscan 9000. I should say that I usually edit my images. For my b&w that means running a script with Levels, Curves and Unsharp Mask which evidently affects contrast and grain. But I picked the first three because I didn't process them much at all. The fourth one I did more, in particular with USM so that's perhaps not so representative. I should also say my developing skills aren't the best so that definitely accounts for flaws. The Coolscans have a very sharp light source (though the 9000 less so) so that may not be comparable to the V550. But even on a more mid-range scanner like the V550 the advice to scan at fullest resolution and downsize will have a big positive impact on the appearance of grain. That said, grain can be very good for scanned images since it can, with skillful sharpening, make them appear sharper than they are. There are many ways to sharpen - it's a skill in itself the beginning of which I'm only beginning to understand - and one usually has to perform it both in several steps during editing and at various places of an image. I was once given the general advice to use Amount at 60-100% and the Radius at 0.6-0.8 (with Threshold at 1) to snap up the grain without it looking too artificial. One can also flip the Amount and Radius values, i.e. set a very low (10-12) Amount and a very high Radius (40-80) which will work a bit like adding contrast to the image but in a better way. Anyway there are lots of different ways and it's a matter of picking one or a few that give results which one likes. br Philip --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) --img--  Flickr (2000ppi) An Epson V550. Obviously you think the grain doesn't look right. Please can you post a link to a photo where the grain is properly resolved so I can see the difference. My searches on flickr for 400TX haven't revealed anything different to my own scans so far (as far as I can tell). I do appreciate that Tri-X is not fine grained but it is less coarse than some other popular 400 speed b&w films. From my research of film and developer recipes I am looking forward to trying TMAX with XTOL for a subtle grain and HP5+ with Rodinal for a stronger grain.

As the headline states, I grew up in Germany but live for professional reasons not related to photography since 2005 permanently in the US. I just recently acquired my first Leica camera - the Leica M6 since I always wanted to have a fully mechanic reliable camera including a light meter. I want to do B&W film photography with this camera since I still develop my own film and use my darkroom to make silver gelatin prints both from digital files (using homemade digital negatives) and from film negatives. My style is predominantly landscape and fine art photography combined with B&W converted infrared photography. This said, I am also using digital cameras in parallel to film cameras. For infrared, I am currently using a converted Canon 5D MkII full frame DSLR with 715 nm cutoff filter, for digital landscape/macro/fine art work I am using a Sony A7R - predominantly with Leica and Voigtlander lenses plus adapter. I am not fixed to just one brand regarding photo gear and simply use what I consider best for my needs. I am looking forward to share photos and experience regarding Leica cameras and M mount lenses.
