On paper, the phone option is better (if it worked as it should on paper) since the phone has many more ways to get its position. Whether it\u2019s through WiFi, GPS, cellular networks, and it can also leverage the data networks to assist in positioning off various radios and sensors and fusing all the information to get the most reliable and accurate position possible using all available information. Even though GPS can operate as a standalone positioning method, even it benefits from a data connection to get assistance data such as time, rough position, and satellite information that helps the receiver to get a position lock much sooner than otherwise achievable as a standalone receiver but this would not be possible since the camera doesn\u2019t have a data connection except through the phone (if connected). So I can see why Leica wanted to go the route of using the phone as a source of positioning data. The problem is not so much the fundamental concept but it is specific to the way it has been implemented. Only Leica knows where the bottle neck lies, whether it\u2019s in the iOS/Android developer frameworks, phone hardware, camera firmware, radio limitations, power consumption limitations, antenna performance, camera power stability, etc.. There are tradeoffs to be made along the way and all the way down the chain. All that being said, as the end customer, I do think we deserve a more reliable system than what is currently being provided. I can see that Leica is putting in effort to address this over the past year or so but it is still not where it needs to be. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that, as Leica prides itself on designing cameras that do not get in the way of the photographer, its implementation of geolocation definitely goes against this ethos. So I surely hope that Leica would make their geolocation feature work as seamlessly as other functionality in their cameras. Location determination is not an easy thing and it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar industry in and of itself but that\u2019s not really an excuse to delivery subpar performance if Leica is going to go through the trouble of implementing such a feature and selling it as a feature for its customers.

The short answer is yes, noticeably so, but it\u2019s still not 100% effective. I compared the amount of photos that had geolocation data vs the total number of photos taken over the two separate hikes and it was as follows: 12hr hike with remote wakeup disabled: Total photos taken over 12 hrs = 265 Total photos with geolocation data = 45 Percentage of photos with successful geotagged metadata = 17% 10hr hike with remote wake enabled: Total photos taken over 10hrs = 195 Total photos with geolocation data = 119 Percentage of photos with successful geotagged metadata = 61% Again, as far as how I used the camera goes, I don\u2019t think I did anything remarkably different between the two hikes. I normally will turn on the camera, take photos (anywhere between 1-5 photos unless I\u2019m on the summit and the views are good), then turn off the camera. The time span between periods where I take a small group of photos can be anywhere from a few minutes to 1-2hrs.
