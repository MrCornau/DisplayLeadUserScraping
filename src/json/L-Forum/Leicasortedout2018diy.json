By dialing down your LCD brightness (in my case with a Mac Cinema display about 50% of full brightness), to edit pictures with daylight coming in the window onto the paper. And, where needed, by adjusting your ambient light on the paper (in your workspace) - open the window blinds, only work in daytime, add some really bright (ideally, daylight-balanced) room lighting for nightime editing/printing, etc. etc. That is the only way to get prints the same brightness as what you see on-screen - make sure you are viewing the picture both on the screen and the print with equal brightnesses. _____________________ As to color spaces, that applies only to the Working Space you choose in Lightroom - Adobe 1998 is the \"preferred\" colo(u)r space for LR or Photoshop and most other picture editing, unless you have a guaranteed reason to use something else. LR Preferences or some other menu item should let you change back from ProPhoto to Adobe 1998. Profiles are similar to - but not identical to - color spaces. So don't mix them up - they do different things. You should have a Profile for your computer screen, built either with Apple's built-in profiling software or with a third-party hardware device. For DIY with Apple's software, see: System Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate and go through the steps it asks for to set white point (yellower or bluer - default computer screens tend to be very blue), and gamma (a contrast curve) - and then save that profile with a name (\"Graeme's Profile Dec. 2018\" or some such). The default gamma setting is generally 2.2. The white point depends on various things, including how \"yellow\" your printing paper is. Usually somewhere between D5000 and D5500 K (degrees kelvin - a yellowish sunlight color). (BTW - I am selling $1000 worth of prints per month using the \"close to useless\" built-in Mac calibration software. And the prints match the screen exactly (despite the limitations of printing pigments vs. glowing screen pixels)). You should set up your Epson and LR printing controls/dialogue boxes so that 1) \"Printer Color Management\" is turned OFF (the printer sits down and shuts up, and lets LR have full control of the color data to print) and 2) then set up your LR printing preferences so that it can - in fact - accurately use that control. \"Lightroom Manages Color\" - ON. That includes choosing a Printer/Paper Profile (and there should be a ton of Epson paper profiles already installed - they came with your Epson P600 software): E.G. - \"SC P600 Series Premium Photo Paper Glossy.\" NB - for the most part, most photo inkjet papers (Luster, various Glossies, glossy Canvas) will work the same with that Premium Glossy profile. I mix-and-match Fiber Gloss, Premium Glossy, Premium Luster, from either Epson or Moab - and the prints all look the same. It is only if you are using matte papers that the profiles may get really different for each paper type and brand. (You can get third-party hardware/software to create your own paper profiles, but Epson's canned profiles are quite good. Other paper makers (Moab, Kodak, Hahnem\u00fchle, Ilford inkjet.....) usually have profiles for their own papers available online for free download.) And choosing a Rendering Intent - by default, \"Relative Colorimetric\" is preferred, with \"Perceptual\" as a secondary choice. Complex to explain the exact difference, which practically speaking is very little except with strongly-saturated colors. And turning on/off Black Point Compensation - usually ON is best to keep the shadows open and with maximum detail. My own settings for PhotoShop (LR's big brother) on a Mac Pro and Cinema display - Working Color Space: Adobe RGB 1998 - Display profile: custom-built with Apple's software, for gamma 2.2, white point D5400.
