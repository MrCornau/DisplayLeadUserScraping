The last thing I want to do is carry expensive camera equipment and have the bag tip and come falling on the ground, no matter how well padded it is. I contacted customer service and received this response, which I feel grossly inadequate, \"we're very sorry to hear about the stitching on the handle of your bag. If we had known about your concerns on the handle beforehand, we would have informed you that the handle on top of the bag is a grab handle, intended for quick grabs, not for carrying the bag long distances. We've designed the bag with one handle because with the messenger design of the bag, having two handles would obstruct access to the inside of the bag.\" They did not admit the design flaw, but did offer to repair it under warranty. They stitched the handle through the interior of the bag and the stitches are exposed on the interior making the bag less attractive. I'm not happy with that type of craftsmanship from the warranty repair. It solves the problem, however, for now... but I still worry about it occurring again in the future.\" I also wonder if this comment regarding the use of cheaper labor has any relationship to these issues, which I suspect aren't the norm. I needed a bigger bag for travel last year and compared ONA to Billingham and, while the ONA bags looked nice, I found that the Billingham offered better functional details such as the way the top handle was secured as well as rain protection by fully overlapping top flap, flap on rear pocket, etc. Maybe not as cosmetically appealing, but clearly designed for real world use. Others, I'm sure, are happy with their ONA bags.

I never understood why they replaced the shutter cocking mechanism with that noisy motor in the M8. If I was to design such a camera it'd be like that: - RAW only (so no white balance is necessary), they could skip the whole image processing engine and rather provide good color profiles... - ISO wheel on the back like the M6 - shutter cocking manually with the lever (no need for thumbs-up) + discreet - obviously good image sensor and really good battery, so you don't have to change it all the time... It'd need much less power, so the battery would last much longer.
