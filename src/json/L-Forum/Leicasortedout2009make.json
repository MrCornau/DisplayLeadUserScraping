I could not make the Metz flashes work together in GNC mode. Sorry, my message was not so clear, put together on an iPhone. The way I got the Metz flashes to work together was by having a \"master\" Metz flash mounted on the M8, in master / A mode, and the remote flashes in \"slave\" / TTL mode using the 3083 on the 54MZ4 or 40 Mz2 or the 70Mz standalone (it has built in functionality).

Worked quite well, even when I hid the remote falsh behind object. The conclusion, and relevence to this thread, \"the SF-58 does not work with the classic Metz Remote system\", they look very similar (on the flash LCD's), act similar but are not compatible.

Interesting thread. Three years ago I started with on-screen work only--slideshows and shooting for the Web (Flickr and work) primarily. Cropped much of the time. Heavy post-production exposure/contrast fixing. Printed the occasional 4x6 locally. No desire for printing anything larger. I could shoot sloppily and get away with it. --img--  Thanks to advice from the forum (and a lot of shooting to improve) I reduced my post work for exposure-related mistakes significantly. And printed more 4x6s and 5x7s. Late last year I made it a point to stop relying on post-production cropping and paying a lot more attention to framing \"in camera.\" I worked to get good at that. Because to have the capability to print credible enlargements you need every pixel. Then, I had an art critique earlier in the year and had to bump out a whole set of 8x12s. I found that many of the things I'd been getting away with I just couldn't get away with. <sigh> But when I \"nailed\" it, they looked incredible. I've made several additional sets of 8x12s, since. And I've worked to nail it more often and pay even closer attention to the shooting process. Eliminating the crop slop, reducing reliance on post work (to tweaks and adjustments, not \"saves\"), learning from the 8x12s, and then working to get better shots technically has opened up the possibility for good 16x20s on a regular basis, and enough confidence to have 20x30s made. (I now have a workflow at a local shop ironed out so the large sized stuff comes back clean.) Big prints for many here are a validation of their work--or just a continuation of a photographic work process they already know. Big prints for me have been a learning tool, forcing more care and diligence during shooting.

(i now have a workflow at a local shop ironed out so the large sized stuff comes back clean.) big prints for many here are a validation of their work--or just a continuation of a photographic work process they already know. big prints for me have been a learning tool, forcing more care and diligence during shooting. i'm still learning, but i will say that when i shoot i want to get *at least* a very credible 16x20 out every shot i take now. i want that capability in case somebody sees something they like and wants it \"printed big.\" i'm running sets of larger prints roughly bimonthly at the moment. thanks, will edited december 9, 2009 by wstotler", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 40753, "year": "2009"}, {"autor": "pezti", "date": "2009-08-07 11:08:00", "content": "Nice.

Nice pic of your new MP3 BTW! --img--  Hi Peter, Thanks for your reply, I have a standard black Summilux from the latter part of the 90s (I think - would have to check the serial No. to confirm) and I liked it a lot. Having said that, I then got a Noctilux that ended up 'fixed' to my .85 M6 (mostly shooting it wide open on Delta 3200) and I never use the Summilux now. I do like the gain in manual focussing speed that you get on the 'lux over the noct though and think a chrome one would be ideal for the MP-3. Of course what this goes to show is that I don't mind a little softness (the noct wide open is hardly what you'd call sharp --img--  , so maybe a chrome v.1 lux might be the call. Thanks for referring me to Mike Dixon's gallery, there's some lovely work in there, although some of the (negative) discussion surrounding the picture of the grizzled man at the bar seems unwarranted. To my mind \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it!\" All the best, Al P.S.

I also have a D7 which is a fun camera to have for carrying in my pocket. The D2; however, remains my favorite! For its focal length, it is fine for much shooting-like the M Series. I learned on the M3 and went forward from that. The outstanding benefits of the D2 are: 1. The Digital Viewfinder! What a gift! When I was shooting in Death Valley, I could not see the taken image on my 5d because of the ambient light. I now use a Hoodman to take care of the problem; but the the D2; it was no problem. It was wonderful! I made a 12-foot pamorama of the sand dunes which is a killer: tack sharp, wonderful tones. It is also ideal fopr those of us who are visuall challenged and have to wear glasses. Adjust the diopter and you are ready to go and shoot with ease! 2. The grid option in the viewfinder makes keeping verticals accurate and panoramas [for post-work in Photoshop] easy to do properely. 3. Bounce Flash. What an easy way to capture a moment of compromised light and have the results come out looking natural and with ease! 4. The fine-focus option to use when using manual focus. I use this a lot of the time when I want to be certain the focus is spot on...and it works every time. I have made tack-sharp 20x24 prints with no compromise. The only drawback is the shutter lag. When I was shooting professional tennis and tried the D2, only by knowing the game well and anticipating the next move was I able to get a shot with the \"motor\" drive. I tried for some time to send my successful sports images from the Houston Astros baseball and the Mens National Clay Court Tennis Championships to Roger Horn of Leica USA to show him that despite the comment made to me by a Leica representative that \"Leica is not for sports\" that with care the D2 could do very credible work-work wich I subsequently had published, I might add but there was little positive response. This was a shame because the D2 can do a great deal of things very well. So yes, I think the D2 is a wonderful camera to have even with its few limitations and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, general camera. BTW It can use the Canon Speedlight in its hot shoe for a greater range of flash coverage as well!

I've owned both, and eventually sold the SL, keeping the SL2. Both were great cameras but I found the SL2 more ergonomically comfortable and, as others indicated, the meter is more sensitive. Here's a link you might find interesting, particularly the chart on which lenses (by cam configuration) can work on which Leica reflex cameras (http://www.photoethnography.com); however there are some lenses which present other issues. I got my SL2 CLA'd right after I got it, the SL I purchased had been CLA'd right before I bought it. Given their ages, I think the CLAs were a good idea. I also own an R8, and find that I typically use the SL2 much more often than the R8, even though the R8 is a much more sophisticated camera. My only disappointment, using either the SL or SL2, was that there wasn't a grip as many more modern designs have, and given the weight of many of the R lenses, I wanted a grip, so finally I made one out of an L bracket which attaches in conjunction with an Arca-Swiss type tripod bracket and a piece of leather surrounding my hand.

I\u2019ve been shooting professionally for about 35 years, on staff at three different newspapers in Canada. After 16 years at the Montreal Gazette I decided to make a change and left the comfort of a full-time position to free-lance and pursue personal projects. Then I moved to the US from Canada for one reason\u2026the love of a Woman. My first introduction to Leica was with my Uncle\u2019s M3, which he bought in 1957 and brought to Canada when he emigrated from Germany in 1960. It held tremendous fascination for me as a young boy: full of mysterious buttons, knobs and strange numbers, that meant nothing to me. I was 10 when he let me take my first family photo with it, heavy and unbalanced, attached to a large Honeywell strobe. Through out my career I\u2019ve used various versions of Nikons and Canons as most news shooters did and still do today. I picked up my first M6 about 11 years ago and started using it on my travels, strictly for personal use. I quickly became hooked and now use them exclusively for all my personal projects. Nowadays, I still use Canons, when I have to. In today\u2019s world there\u2019s no avoiding digital use if you want to make a living. However I still keep at least 100 rolls of Tri-X in the fridge at all times; have once again learned the tricks of transporting film through airport security systems; turn the kitchen into a makeshift lab whenever my wife leaves town on business; and am trying to figure a way to fit a darkroom into a 8 x 7 foot closet\u2026 before it\u2019s too late. I found this site through a good friend in Montreal, and thought it would be interesting to get involved with a group who seem quite passionate about one of the few iconic cameras left in production today. Thanks for reading and I look forward to helping out and contributing as time allows.
