You forgot to add the most important unofficial feature. It is rumoured to be a BSI sensor ! If it is anything like the one in the SL2-S, it is a GAME CHANGER. The low light capabilities of the M11 will finally be worth mentioning, and it will remove all need for ibis. Fixed bottom plate, I am curious about that ! Agreed, if it is the same sensor as the SL2-S then that might well justify my skipping the M10-R, I've been waiting to see if this could happen. At 36mp that would be a sweet spot whereas the 41mp sensor in the R didn't work for me. Isn't the SL2-S 24mp though.......so maybe it'll not be the same sensor? The bottom plate?

I have used both - the difference is visible even in a moderate-sized print (21\" x 14\"/A2). Basically, anything that might provoke a moir\u00e9 or aliasing in a color picture (fine textures (cloth, wood-grain), thin lines, sharp edges) can render with up to about 41% more resolution and clarity (square-root of 2 and all that), thanks to no \"fuzzing\" of luminance data between neighboring pixels in de-mosaicing the color. Which cannot be bypassed simply by converting to B&W (at least with standard commercial post-processing software). In other words, everything else being equal (lens, steadiness, focus), a Monochrom 40-Mpixel camera should have the clarity and detail of a 56-Mpixel color image converted to B&W. There are, of course, other factors. Converting a color image allows for after-the-fact choices about how colors render in monochrome (without having to make a command decision on the spot to use a red/orange/green/blue filter on the lens) and sometimes allows saving highlight detail where only one color channel is \"blown\" (e.g. bright skies - if the Monochrom blows to white, there is no \"plan RGB\" ).

I know I don't \"count\", as I've got my own goofy ideas, but to be honest, comparing metering in the M10 and the metering in my Nikon D750 isn't even a contest. Now that I've learned from @jaapvhow to make the best use of what the Leica provides, I accept it - but then I pick up my DSLR, with metering in the sensor, and soon to be even the shutter in the sensor, and using my M10 is more and more like metering in my M3 - with the Leicameter up on top. I was taking high dynamic range photos with my M10 a month ago, processing them in PhotoLab 5, and getting complaints from the senior members of the forum that I was hurting myself by insisting on using the M10. So, for a test, I switched back to the Nikon, and I was back to any type of metering I wanted, included \"highlight weighted spot metering\". If you have time, check it out. There is no way the M10 is going to compare, when it reflects some light from the shutter curtain onto a sensor, that covers just part of the image. The Z9 does this even better, with stills, video, burst shooting, and any number of unbelievable ways (to me) that I never dreamed I would have in a camera. I still want my M10 because it is relatively small, capable of creating excellent images most of the time, is quiet, doesn't scare off my \"victims\", and because I've been shooting with an M since the 1960's. As a mechanical device, I'm sure the M11 will be of higher quality than the mass-produced Z9, but \"mechanical\" is being replace with \"electronics\" in so many ways. There is no way I can focus my M as quickly as the newest Nikons, even my D750, and the ability to \"track\" focus of things like eyes is flat out amazing to me. My ultimate Leica - I'd like one that looks and feels like a Leica M, with the electronics and metering and lens coupling like the new Nikons, and I realize this means a whole new line of lenses from Leica, but that's what Nikon just did - the lens mount and lenses made for the Z9 are very different from all older Nikon lenses, and without an adapter, they are not interchangeable. Leica could probably buy the sensor and electronics design from one of the Japanese firms they have worked with in the past. The sales price would come down, as electronics are less expensive than mechanics.

A month ago, I was using only my M10, and people in the DxO Forum were showing me that the M10 didn't have enough dynamic range to do what I wanted. Most of the time, the highlights were blown out, with sunrise and sunset photos. Then they showed me a comparison on DxOmark. I found this quick comparison, copied below. Back then I didn't understand dynamic range, and I decided that I would switch to the D750 for a while. I'm still learning, day by day. I'll copy a small version of my original file that was slightly underexposed to correct the blown highlights, at least a little. Other than automatic lens and body corrections, it is un-edited. I wanted to fix the blown-out windows in the building, and lighten up the island. That's not really relevant, but this is the image I should have posted earlier. I see this every morning, and if tomorrow is a clear day, I'll take the same image with my M10. Maybe I have learned enough that I'll get a better result - but the real question posed by people in the forum, since I already own the M10 and the D750, why am I not using the camera with the more appropriate sensor? To @jaapv I completely agree with what you wrote, and yes, \"processing is the key\", but doesn't the processing depend on a good image to start with. If I were more experienced, I could probably look at the scene, and select an exposure that I knew would work. Since I'm not, my guide is to measure for the brightest part of a scene, over-expose by 1.7 stops, and trust the camera to give me a good, workable image. The Nikon shot below was not captured that way - I set it to spot metering with \"highlight metering\" activated, which supposedly would find the brightest part of the image and adjust accordingly. That didn't work, even though the camera was in Aperture priority mode, just as I essentially do on my M10. Will I do that on my Z9 if I buy one? To me, my job is composition and timing, and fine tuning will be done in the image editor. Unless I missed something, the M10 only pays attention to the areas you demonstrated in the image you posted for what gets metered. Anything outside of that area apparently gets ignored. That is where I think the Nikon has an advantage, in that it can evaluate the entire sensor, if that's what I tell it to do, or anything else. I'm not as good at this as I wish I was. With the Nikon I'm getting closer. With the M10 I thought the same. I don't believe my decisions should be based on DxOMark, but it's a strong influence. I won't in any way argue with you, but I have all sorts of limitations for whatever reason. I think for a while now, my best choice is to do the best I can with what I've got. I will take another sunrise photo with the M10, with my new Voigtlander 50 which is the best lens I've got, being just as careful as before with the exposure.

Every manufacturer processes differently. I'm sure it worked on the Nikon for you, but I'm equally sure that wont be the case with the way the M processes scenes. Again, generically to be successful with the M you want to guard on the right and push on the left. 19 minutes ago, MikeMyers said: If you look at the coverage of the M10 spot meter reading, it's not really a \"spot\", and it can't be, because the light is being reflected off the shutter back to the sensor that reads the light. Actually, thats not correct. The M has two completely separate ways of metering. The traditional one which essentially is center weighted, is what you are referring to and is the only mode available when shooting outside of live view. When you select spot or multi metering in the menu, that ONLY applies when you are in LV. When in LV, all metering is done off the sensor like any other conventional mirrorless camera. It must be, as in order to generate an image to the EVF or display, the shutter has to be open light to reach the sensor. As the shutters open, there's nothing available to reflect the light to the conventional meter. So your description of convention meeting is correct and indeed there is no spot metering only center weighed. However in live view there is true spot metering. The menu also affords you the option of using center weighted metering in LV as well. While the camera is long gone, I still have the manual. From the M10 manual: Exposure Metering Methods Depending on whether the Live View mode is being used or not, various metering methods are available to you. \u2013 If you are using the exposure meter: Strongly center-weighted metering. This method takes account of the entire image field, although the parts of the subject situat- ed in the center have more influence on the exposure value calculation than the areas at the margins. The light reflected by bright shutter curtain blades is captured by a photo diode and measured. \u2013 In Live View mode: Either spot, center-weighted and multi-field metering. In these cases, metering is done by the picture sensor. Selecting the Live View metering methods Setting the function 1. 2. Select the menu item Exp.

Each to their own, I guess. I guess I'm one of those who deny this I still have my D800e and 100% crops from that are as sharp as from most anything that I've used. Even though the AA filter was removed from the 800e, there is still a low pass filter (albeit weaker than the AA filter in the original D800) so that does blur things a bit in comparison with the D850 for example, but that's not the result of having \"more pixels\"....the 850 actually has \"more\". I tend to do physical prints, so in theory higher resolution would benefit me by allowing more crop flexibility while maintaining a good print resolution. Practically, 24MP is plenty for that though. But also practically, even with my older computer systems, 40-50mp doesn't bog anything down for me, and there seems no downside to having higher resolution sensors.

Wow, what a difference. Love the 40mp resolution. Photos are razor sharp with the 50 Summicron-M.

The advice I read on this forum to make sure and flat-pad-of-the-finger-slowly-push the shutter button versus fingertip-straight-down makes a HUGE difference! But anyway, the M default max of ISO 1600 plus the default shutter speed equation are a recipe for blurred shots. Rangefinder is spot on for focus at f2 on the 50 Summicron-M. Focus peaking was fine on the M10-P, but it seems to get in the way of seeing perfect focus at 40mp and turning it off was a big improvement, at least for wide open at close distance. This is my first black M, and the finish surprised me in a good way. It's much softer/matte in look and feel, and it's much more pleasing than the finish on the Q2M (which is nice, but a bit boring and smooth by comparison). I was also pleasantly surprised with how flat the Leica red dot was. Not sure why, but in my mind, I've always perceived the red dot in photos as being slightly dome-shaped, like a ladybug soft shutter release button, which it is not \ud83d\ude02 The M10-R's exposure metering combined with the gamma curve Leica applies to the M10-R is so much better than the M10/P. Not having to remember to not kill the highlights is one less thing to get in the way of the simplified user experience of the M. Maybe some see the M as more complicated, something that you have to give more thought to, but I kind of see it the opposite way, especially with the R. I grew up using film cameras with the exact same controls, so this camera seems simple to me versus using my R5, which can often feel like playing Star Trek 3D chess with a Vulcan. I haven't shot enough with the M10-R to fully know what the image character/tonality/color-signature will be, but the first few SOOC shots (with JPEG sharpness and saturation set to max) look very close to my Canon R5 images, which I like very much (especially considering that color is being delivered by the older design of the 50 Summicron-M). I think the M10-R with a 21/50/90 combo just might be my own personal holy grail for a small, lightweight landscape field kit. My advice for anyone considering both is go straight to the R and never look back. If you get blurred shots on the R, you simply need to raise your shutter speed and/or improve your shooting technique.

I have been wondering about this, prompted by a comment buried deep in another thread somewhere. I wonder if some of the problems that you were seeing with the M10-R were due to \"shutter shock\" rather than simply the higher resolution. This seems to be something that commonly most affects exposures in the 1/60 to 1/125 range, it is to do with vibrations from the shutter mechanism. At slower speeds it doesn't show up because there is a more exposure not affected and at higher speeds there is not enough time to move. Maybe your particular M10-R had a slightly sticky shutter which made it specially prone to this. John The second thing people did when I first reported motion blur on my M10R was to raise the possibility of my M10R being deficient (the first thing was to blame my technique). But since then, several other users have reported and confirmed that they too, in fact, need to shoot at least a 1/250th, and for some even 1/500th to be assured to get sharp photos. At this point, I can assure you that it's a general issue on the M10R. Those who don't run into this problem simply don't have the same shooting style than me. They must be very slow shooters. Spot a landscape, stop your feet, take your stance, compose, focus, hold with two hands, breath in, stop breathing, stay immobile, and press the shutter, then breathe out. I am more of a run and gun shooter. No still life. The moment I returned my R for my P, I got my liberty back again. It took me an instant walking out the shop to realise it.

I understand that different sensors have different characteristics, but I would assume that Leica takes seriously the way their cameras reproduce color and have influence in how their partners work to achieve those goals. Adobe does not make its profiles in a vacuum, Leica has said that they worked closely with their engineers for the S3 for example. It is there that I wish that what they came up with were more like the M9 and S006. I don't think I am alone, but I also think that color is very personal, and there are many people who do not have such warm feelings about the rendering. I guess I am a bit biased, as when I was very early in my ownership of the M9, I did some work for a show on both 4x5 E6 (I believe E100G at the time), and I found that the color of the M9 files out of camera resembled the E6 very closely, and only minor adjustments were needed to make everything fit together. That was the first time I had such a positive experience. I had been shooting a Sinar eMotion 22 which was supposed to be great for color (I thought it was terrible), and later a Nikon D3, and both of them left me very cold. Along comes the M9 and it was just spot on (at low ISO), so I miss it for that feeling. I no longer have the S006 (having traded it in for the S3) or the M9 (having sold it when I moved to an M10), and while I will concede that the newer versions are more practical in most measurable ways, I miss the color of those CCD cameras, and often think that I did not necessarily make the right decision.

I'd always like to see improved ISO performance. MP resolution is a tough one as my M10 is good enough and if I want more, the M10-R has enough for my needs. IBIS would be nice as it would keep the lenses small. I shoot in low light quite frequently and reducing shutter speed even further while hand-held would be nice. However, that would come with additional weight and most likely additional thickness so I'd rather keep things the way they are. I use a Thumbie and a Leica leather half case. I like that the bodies come with a simple design and that we can each add extra parts to suit our ergonomic desires. If the bodies come with additional attachments, then some would have to file them off to get their desired configuration and that isn't an option. It's better that we can add them, and it would be even better if they came as bundled accessories! I hope we don't move to an EVF as I personally prefer optical. A new, improved Visoflex would be nice and I believe one is rumoured with backwards compatibility with the M10. The Visoflex 020 significantly increases the drain on my batteries so hopefully the new one will draw less power or the M11 will contain a higher capacity battery without increasing the thickness of the body. I do wonder how much the GPS function on the Visoflex drains the battery and wish it could be turned off as I neither want nor need it and would prefer it wasn't built into the body unless it could be disabled. Hopefully the new Visoflex will be a little smaller and won't obstruct visibility of the shutter dial. A smaller metal one would be cool, particularly if it isn't much bigger than the Voigtlander 21/25mm round metal viewfinder, but that wouldn't be able to fit the electronic components. A level indicator would be nice, and I did like the option of white or red framelines on the M240. With my leather half-case, it essentially operates as an M10-D when shooting, but with the option of chimping when I feel it to be necessary. I like that it protects the body and provides a small amount of additional grip. I prefer the removable bottom plate as it's different, but accessing it is the one down side of using the half-case. It would also be nice to be able to easily customise the red dot. While I am hugely fond of my red dot and wouldn't tape over it, there are days where I may prefer a black dot with silver Leica logo for example. It's a small thing and hugely personal, but it would be a nice touch.

Back to the test bench\u2026 I see indeed differences between long lenses especially when I cleaned the 180 Telyt R I saw less dust. Yes this must be lens dust.

Quote They are just ... tools (expensive for some people), -A.Noctilux, I agree..a camera is just a tool and it is a very expensive one at that. I'm the kind of guy that would buy a finely crafted screwdriver for 10 times the price of a cheap Chinese one. Both will accomplish the same job (hopefully without breaking) but I enjoy quality, craftsmanship and pride in ownership. I love photography, I certainly favor certain brands over others but I don't feel that I would have a life long commitment to one brand...whatever tool works best for my needs. Quote I've had Leica-M cameras since 1988 and never had the rangefinder need adjustment, although it can be affected by shocks. I have the M10 and the 020 Visoflex, but don't really like using the latter. -Nowhereman, thanks for the reply...it sounds like with a certain degree of care it shouldn't need routine adjustments...this is great! Quote My own advice re: RF focusing: When in the split field and are twisting the focus STOP when you see that first contrast alignment. Don't fall into the habit of diddling back and forth to check. With practice you'll learn that there'll be no doubt about your skill and you'll nail 'em every time. When you can do this in gloomy flat light concistantly It's a great feeling. -Stephen.s1, Thank you for the advice...I look forward applying that technique Quote Two years with my first Leica camera, the M10 and so far the RF remains precise. I do use my gear often and as needed, only taking care not to use in any sort of rain and of course handling as careful as I would any other advanced camera system. With some practice ( weeks), I am now able to use the RF for both 1.4 and even f0.95 successfully and consistently. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I was able to shoot RF at F0.95 consistently too. * I do need to use my specs when using the rangefinder and if I get into a situation where RF is difficult, I'll substitute with Zone Focusing sometimes using both techniques, to get the shot. The 24MP M10 sensor is just fine, more than fine for me even along side my 61 MP Sony. I am sure I will at some point upgrade to the M10-R, but for now I don't see any need or urgency to update the M10 to 40.89 MPs. Just starting out, I might advise to spend on Leica M lenses and start out with the 24MP M10. FWIW, even after two years I am still thrilled and very happy with my Leica Rangefinder kit which to me is a completely different system and approach compared to my Sony mirrorless system. I would't give up either any time soon, and very happy I can use both systems. -LBJ2, Thank you for the tip on keeping the rangefinder window clean...I think the 24mpx M10-P will be perfect for my applications. I really like my Sony too and I just love the thought of having a drastically different system...I'm looking forward to it. I'm a perfectionist, I can't help it...I insist that my first lens be a Leica M lens...good glass never goes out of style. Quote I did the same for my 40th birthday: a brand new M10 plus a lens. One of my best present ever \ud83d\ude42 _Dennis, great minds think alike...thanks for the encouragement Quote To KNOCKS AND BUMPS: Unfortunately mine fell down twice from the hight of a seat of approx 40 to 45cm onto hard ground: The first time onto gravel and the second time onto a hard tile. Well there are very little marks on the body but the rest was fine and perfect. Maybe I was lucky but I am sure that the equipment is extremely solid. -M10forMe, I'm sorry for the misfortune but it does sound like you lucked out...I'm happy to hear of the great build quality and durability Quote The 10P and 10D look so nice with the lettering on top and no red dot, bit its a personal thing. I just swapped my 10P for a 10D. It was a hard decision but to me the 'absence' of the rear LCD is my perfect digital camera. The P is lovely too. 24MP is a sweet spot. I have a Visioflex 020 as its quite a useful addition to the D (es when using wide or long lenses (I have a 24 Summilux and a 90mm Elmarit) I dropped my M9 Monochrom once, from standing height.

Although I'd be curious to, even if I guessed it, your opinion on the camera after hesitating, lusting, then owning it. Thanks also for the thread. I had actually read them all carefully, and I started a new one because I wanted some \"2021\" feelings from users. I may also add this fantastics thread to the ones you recommended. Bottom line is long-term, I try (tried?) to keep the number of digital camera bodies to a minimum. I only shoot 1 lens and 1 camera at a time and want to max out my expenditure on a digital body. I hesitated because I was caught in two minds - I wanted an upgrade on the M240 and felt like the M10P would be better and more all rounded as an only camera. But I also felt the M10D would teach me more as a photographer. In the end after that episode I got an M10M and used the SL/SL2/Sigma FP as my colour cam but didn't enjoy the SL/SL2/FP colour cam experience. I always wanted the M10D during this time but it was only after using the SL/SL2/FP as a \"backup\"/colour cam did I realise the only colour cam I wanted to shoot with was an M. I sold the SL/SL2/FP and wanted to shoot the M10M for a year as my only camera, but then a good deal on the M10D came up... I always had an itch to scratch and if I had another colour camera I'd probably be annoyed with myself if I got the M10D because of the duplication of colour cameras. That's why I never got it until I sold everything else but the M10M (less overlap -> B&W vs colour, resolution, high ISO performance, LCD vs none). If I had a colour camera/M I'd still be lusting for it if I didn't get one though, but not enough to make me buy one cause I'm too practical to own duplicate cameras (or a skint, depends how you see it). Owning the M10M and M10D is an excuse that my lineup can cater for two bodies as otherwise I don't shoot enough to otherwise justify owning more than one. I tell myself I can use these 2 cameras Now that I have it, I'm settled. It was the final piece to the jigsaw of my camera gear lineup and it has delivered everything I want in a colour camera. You're not really chasing resolution, high iso or dynamic range with this camera anyway. It has taught me to bring the camera to my eye, compose and shoot better. I treat it like a film camera in the sense I'm not spraying pictures, but I acknowledge the medium is different and it is a different tool. If you want the experience of shooting a film M, shoot a film M. This said, on most days when I use the M10D, I come back home having taken a handful of pictures. With a camera with LCD, e.g. my M10M, I can easily shoot an equivalent of half a roll to a roll of film in one outing (or more, depends what I'm doing) - I think it has to do with chimping or checking your pics on the spot, which has its pros and cons and is just a different experience but one not better than the other. LCD and digital do go hand-in-hand, as does digital going hand-in-hand processing in the computer with more immediacy. The M10D just forgoes the LCD aspect. It's not a fake film M per se. As others have mentioned my only gripe is the power button is not where it is on other digital Ms. There's a semi workaround as suggested by others as well, which is just leaving it on auto-power off at 2 mins and just letting it sleep and never having to touch that wheel (I only turn it off when I'm swapping batteries just for good measure, but I'm quite sure the camera itself is sleeping/off so should be ok to do so if I didn't. Someone can correct me on this). The lack of a fuller Fotos App menu is not a deal breaker. It's frustrating, as can be the use of the EVF (doesn't shut off and GPS is on) but I don't use the EVF. It is absolutely possible that an M11D will come out with an electronic shutter with little rolling shutter (what a dream! and blasphemy for the purists?), SL2-S high ISO, better dynamic range, same body profile, power switch at the shutter button, better WIFI, better menus in FOTOS, a better viewfinder (possible? but not necessary). It's technology and things will always improve. But how much of the above do you need and how long are you willing to wait? If say the M11 comes out late this year, the P and D versions 1.5 to 2 years later, that's 2 to 3 years more of waiting. In reality an electronic shutter is nice but from my experience with the Sigma FP it does ruin the tactile experience of shooting. I rarely ever shoot above ISO6400 (and with this camera I don't shoot from the hip so much, which means more stability as I bring the camera to my eye more and being able to handhold slower shutter speeds), the files are plenty malleable for me. For a non-pro like me, if I can't get good shots with the M10D, no camera will save me (though my M10M is in reserve). You're buying the idea of a screen-less digital camera. If my experience is anything to go by, this is a camera you either lust for or don't. And if you lust for one don't get one, you will lust and lust until the day you succumb and then you will wonder why you didn't get it all that while ago.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317108-do-you-like-you-m10-d/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4121723", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "14 hours ago, steven said: thank you for this very useful testimony. although i'd be curious to, even if i guessed it, your opinion on the camera after hesitating, lusting, then owning it. thanks also for the thread. i had actually read them all carefully, and i started a new one because i wanted some \"2021\" feelings from users. i may also add this fantastics thread to the ones you recommended. bottom line is long-term, i try (tried?) to keep the number of digital camera bodies to a minimum. i only shoot 1 lens and 1 camera at a time and want to max out my expenditure on a digital body. i hesitated because i was caught in two minds - i wanted an upgrade on the m240 and felt like the m10p would be better and more all rounded as an only camera. but i also felt the m10d would teach me more as a photographer. in the end after that episode i got an m10m and used the sl/sl2/sigma fp as my colour cam but didn't enjoy the sl/sl2/fp colour cam experience. i always wanted the m10d during this time but it was only after using the sl/sl2/fp as a \"backup\"/colour cam did i realise the only colour cam i wanted to shoot with was an m. i sold the sl/sl2/fp and wanted to shoot the m10m for a year as my only camera, but then a good deal on the m10d came up... i always had an itch to scratch and if i had another colour camera i'd probably be annoyed with myself if i got the m10d because of the duplication of colour cameras. that's why i never got it until i sold everything else but the m10m (less overlap -> b&w vs colour, resolution, high iso performance, lcd vs none). if i had a colour camera/m i'd still be lusting for it if i didn't get one though, but not enough to make me buy one cause i'm too practical to own duplicate cameras (or a skint, depends how you see it). owning the m10m and m10d is an excuse that my lineup can cater for two bodies as otherwise i don't shoot enough to otherwise justify owning more than one. i tell myself i can use these 2 cameras now that i have it, i'm settled. it was the final piece to the jigsaw of my camera gear lineup and it has delivered everything i want in a colour camera. you're not really chasing resolution, high iso or dynamic range with this camera anyway. it has taught me to bring the camera to my eye, compose and shoot better. i treat it like a film camera in the sense i'm not spraying pictures, but i acknowledge the medium is different and it is a different tool. if you want the experience of shooting a film m, shoot a film m. this said, on most days when i use the m10d, i come back home having taken a handful of pictures. with a camera with lcd, e.g. my m10m, i can easily shoot an equivalent of half a roll to a roll of film in one outing (or more, depends what i'm doing) - i think it has to do with chimping or checking your pics on the -----> spot !!! , which has its pros and cons and is just a different experience but one not better than the other. lcd and digital do go hand-in-hand, as does digital going hand-in-hand processing in the computer with more immediacy. the m10d just forgoes the lcd aspect. it's not a fake film m per se. as others have mentioned my only gripe is the power button is not where it is on other digital ms. there's a semi workaround as suggested by others as well, which is just leaving it on auto-power off at 2 mins and just letting it sleep and never having to touch that wheel (i only turn it off when i'm swapping batteries just for good measure, but i'm quite sure the camera itself is sleeping/off so should be ok to do so if i didn't. someone can correct me on this). the lack of a fuller fotos app menu is not a deal breaker. it's frustrating, as can be the use of the evf (doesn't shut off and gps is on) but i don't use the evf. it is absolutely possible that an m11d will come out with an electronic shutter with little rolling shutter (what a dream! and blasphemy for the purists?), sl2-s high iso, better dynamic range, same body profile, power switch at the shutter button, better wifi, better menus in fotos, a better viewfinder (possible?

Well, I loved using my M10P, trhrough the OVF, but with the screen on on low luminosity. This way, my image was light metered like it is 2020, or 2021. Not like it's 1960. This is the one thing that I don't know if ill get used to, ever. I need to try hard, but its making me miss my P too much. P.S. I am totally aware that the problem is me. Not the camera. I am just not trained, or good enough, to have to worry about spot metering. If anyone has tips on how to expose better with spot metering, maybe that'll change my early opinion? Metering with the M10-D?.......Again Leica hobbled the camera by limiting it's Settings options and I don't understand why, it is after all a M10/M10-P without a screen, right?.The electronic guts are the same I presume, so why can't it have a few more M10-P functions? Leica has never explained this and it's bloody annoying. Anyway the metering solution is simple to rectify. In Auto just quickly point the camera at the area you want to favour metering wise, hold the shutter halfway to lock the exposure, re-frame and shoot, that works for me just fine...........Or go manual and teach yourself to read the light, it's really not too hard to get there and liberating when you do. Sure there's enough that's annoying about the camera especially if we too readily compare it to it's siblings, ( guilty there myself at times ), but this camera is different..... it encourages you to hone your photographic approach primarily because of what it cannot, will not, do for you.

It works the same way that digital, in general, needs to be exposed for the highlights, like slide film. The M10, however, complicates this by the fact that Leica has applied a curve in the DNG file, which gives more of the dynamic range to the shadows than the highlights, as has been documented by @adan. This means that it's necessary to underexpose somewhat more than with some other digital cameras when you want to protect the highlights: usually, underexposing by \u2154-rds of a stop will work but, with strong backlight or sidelight, I've sometimes had to underexpose as much as two stops. I think Leica has put this kind of contrast curve in the DNG because people were complaining with M240 that the files SOOC looked too flat. I would have preferred that Leica did not add this contrast curve, so that one could shoot for a rather flat image SOOC and easily adjust to what I one wants in post, the same way many photographers used to do with B&W film.

The most reliable image taking machine you should take into harsh conditions is the iPhone 12 Pro, not a full camera at all. This is such an old thread I somewhat regret picking it up again. But not entirely. I expect more from Leica. They are comfortable wearing the mantle of being the best. There are armies of acolytes who limn their perfection. Some wear a red Leica dot like a Hindu tilaka on their foreheads. For that kind of devotion I expect results to be what the reputation infers. I expect perfection or at least near perfection. I do not expect a bunch of shaky evidence put forward that electronics fail after four years or anything similar. This is a Leica, it is supposed to be the best so just be the best an stop whining about electronic failures. I have a Sony DSC-S70 from 1999 that works just fine, thank you. I have other old cameras, electronic, that work just fine, zero failure. Do they fail more than Leica? They may. But to have the drengle with shoddy electronics in two cameras, the M8/8.2 and M9 is not the mark of excellence nor the mark of a manufacturer who has shopped for the best components nor learned from previous, then recent glaring failures. This is shoddy. It really is. And I guess the ass-whipping got their Teutonic attention back there in Wetzlar as I understand that they fail now no more than Japanese cameras. Sort of good, I guess. I've got four old Leicas. An M8.2, an M9 and two M240's. The CCD cameras have that lovely almost holographic image description that the Kodak-made sensor for Leica has. The M8.2 is quite delightful. But for me it is a tool, not a lifestyle. I enjoy using them. I enjoy the results. They render dark scenes better than my Sony A7M III. Dark scenes look dark, artistically so. And as I have said, I love the M8,2 color and almost holographic image. What also makes me happy is that I have just given up worrying about when they will break and use them and treat them kindly. What's really funny is that my Pentax Q-S1 with its 12 megapixel pinky fingernail sized sensor is a close second to the M8.2 in color and image definition. Pentax tuned that BSI-CMOS sensor really well. As always, YMMV. Have a great day. I am. And please do not brand me as anti-German, we are from Germany, Berlin.

Do Siemens produce smartphones? Do Grundig produce Smart TV-s?... Huwaei now posess technology and practical knowledge. Two decades of stupid politicians and (who knows) other influencers convinced European citizens that industry and production is something bad (pollution, CO2,...). So at the end, after decades, you theoretically know what you have to do, but you don't know how to perform the task. This is happening now in Europe. And Leica is not alone here... (I somehow sympathise with Leica) I still remember newspaper titles: \"We, in Europe, are developing a society of wisdom and knowlege\". It is OK to have knowledge (recipe, theory) how to bake bread but at the end you have to bake it\ud83d\ude42 And then you realise (after few error-tray cicles) what are important details, how your oven behaves etc. Outsourcing is double-edged sword. I still remember a conversation with an engineer of very famous German company asking me details about zinc coating (decades old and basic technology). I was fascinated and asked him: \"but you (german engineers) were the best platers in world, how you don't know this?\". His answer was very direct:\"we are outsourcing \"old technologies\" and now, after decades I have no clue what to specify on the drawing, because I have no production and technologist to talk with\" \ud83e\udd14 Leica is doing marvelous job in its optical (still not outsourced) department.

(i somehow sympathise with leica) i still remember newspaper titles: \"we, in europe, are developing a society of wisdom and knowlege\". it is ok to have knowledge (recipe, theory) how to bake bread but at the end you have to bake it\ud83d\ude42 and then you realise (after few error-tray cicles) what are important details, how your oven behaves etc. outsourcing is double-edged sword. i still remember a conversation with an engineer of very famous german company asking me details about zinc coating (decades old and basic technology). i was fascinated and asked him: \"but you (german engineers) were the best platers in world, how you don't know this?\". his answer was very direct:\"we are outsourcing \"old technologies\" and now, after decades i have no clue what to specify on the drawing, because i have no production and technologist to talk with\" \ud83e\udd14 leica is doing marvelous job in its optical (still not outsourced) department. they are too small to produce electronics at home so outsourcing is needed. but how to specify important details if you are not producing electronics for some decades now all over the continent? where to find experienced and qualified engineers?

Don't start with using a swab. Normally that is only needed in extreme cases when the dust won't be removed by less invasive means. Quote Question: There are spots on my images, especially at small apertures. This is sensor dirt. All digital cameras with interchangable lenses have this problem, but an M camera is particularly prone, because there is no mirror as extra barrier and the lack of an AA filter makes the dirt more visible. One should prevent dust from entering the camera as much as possible. There are a number of strategies. 1. Avoid changing lenses more than necessary. 2. Change lenses in as much of a dust-free environment as possible 3. Keep the rear end of the lens as clean as possible 4. Change the lens with the camera mouth facing downwards 5. (This may be a myth) Switch off the camera before changing lenses. But dust will come on the sensor anyway. Consult the manual to find the sensor cleaning item in the menu and use a FULLY charged battery. Before opening the shutter blow out the camera (using a bulb blower, not compressed air or your mouth!) to dislodge any loose dust. If the dust on the sensor is loose one can blow off the sensor using a good bulb blower, (Rocket Blower by Giotto for instance) with the camera mouth facing downwards. If that does not clear the problem there are sensor brushes like the Arctic Butterfly by Visible Dust that are quite effective or the little vacuum cleaner by Green Clean. At this stage the use of a Sensor Loupe can be very helpful. If spots on the sensor persist you are dealing with stuck dirt like pollen or oil spots and need to revert to wet cleaning. There are numerous threads on the subject. The Visible Dust products are highly recommended or the Green Clean wet-and-dry method. Use a proper solvent for grease if you think you are dealing with oil etc. (Visible Dust Smear Away or Dust-Aid Sensor Clean (my preference) Open the shutter for cleaning and blow it once again with a bulb blower or vacuum clean it, to remove any loose particles which might be dragged across the sensor and cause scratches. Although the M is full frame and there are size 1 sensor swabs on the market, I prefer using the swabs for 1.3 sensors (and APS-C swabs for the M8) Take a clean swab, put on three small drops of Sensor Cleaning Fluid and in two sweeps, top and bottom go to one side - do not over-press!!- and sweep back again, using the other side of the swab automatically. Or, using the wet-and-dry system, swab with the wet sponge and dry with a couple of sweeps with the dry swab. Don't let the fluid spill over the edge of the sensor too much - there are electronic connections there. That is all - close the shutter and test the camera by taking an unfocused image of an evenly lit surface at the smallest aperture. In the unlikely case it is needed, repeat. There are other cleaning systems, such as stamping tools. I find them quite effective, as long as there are no greasy spots on the sensor. Just stamp, don't rub. They are a bit scary as one pulls the cover glass. Leica Customer Service seem to be quite happy using them, so they should be safe. . There are also sensor cleaning services or Leica Customer Service, but those are expensive and will keep the camera for a while. They may also not be readily available if one is travelling. Sensor cleaning is something any owner should be able to do himself.

I\u2019d be quite interested to hear your thoughts after that, and seeing image comparisons between the same shot brim both cameras... This thread dates back to one year ago, when I was musing about the M10-M and the, then, expected M10-R. Since then, there's no dilemma for me: I subsequently decided to keep the M10. Basically, I still feel that 24 MP is the \"sweet spot\", especially for my high contrast photography, because I doubt that the 40 MP of the two new Leica cameras will give me anything but increased cost and possible problems with camera shake. With regard to the latter, have you seen some of the posts by @Steven, who found that shooting with the M10-R he had camera shake at shutter speeds below 1/250 sec. Some LUF posters claim that they can handhold the M10\u2013R at 1/60 and even 1/30 sec. However, as I often go for \"immediacy\", I doubt that I would be able do that on a consistent basis with the M10-R or the M10-M without IBIS, even if it could work for me for some images. In this respect, I'm encouraged to see that Leica has introduced the S2-S with a 24 MP sensor, which I hopes indicates that there could be a 24 MP. But all this goes back much further for me. On the old CompuServe photo forum, as well as on the old Leica forum on photo.net, people used to say that if you wanted to print larger than 11\u00d714 inches you should go to medium format. But I have always liked the \"35mm aesthetic\". Around 2005, I saw a Moriyama Daido retrospective at the Gallery of New South Wales, which showed 60 large prints (60 by 40 inches) shot with Tri-X and printed with an Epson wide format printer. The prints were dazzling, and didn't need medium format film. A few years ago, Moriyama had another exhibition at the Cartier Foundation in Paris: this was all digital work that he shot with a camera that had a tiny sensor, the Nikon Coolpix 6500, I believe. Indeed, I made a print from the Ricoh GRD at 58 x 45 inches print that I like a lot. And, of course, I have 60 by 40 inch prints made from the M10 without any problem. But that is the, usually, high-contrast, expressionist, and \"rougher\" look that I like. Of course, I understand that other photographers will prefer a 40 MP camera. The other issue you referred to is that of a color camera versus an M-Monochrom. When I had the M-Monichrom, I also had a M9-P. Essentially, I shot then alternately in \"binges\" of month, or so, each. When I reviewed my B&W images from these two cameras, I found ones I liked from both; but I concluded that I preferred the flexibility of using \"digital filters\" in Lightroom or Silver Efex with the camera to shooting with the Monochrom and sometimes using glass filters. And of course, all the Leica Monochroms are great cameras and I understand who people like them. ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/305689-m10-monochrom-vs-m10-%E2%80%94-and-generally-color-camera-vs-bw/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4126001", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "15 hours ago, cayenne said: i might suggest renting a m10m, and shooting shots with it side by side with your color camera, and compare the experiences shooting and in post...? i\u2019d be quite interested to hear your thoughts after that, and seeing image comparisons between the same shot brim both cameras... this thread dates back to one year ago, when i was musing about the m10-m and the, then, expected m10-r. since then, there's no dilemma for me: i subsequently decided to keep the m10. basically, i still feel that 24 mp is the \"sweet -----> spot !!! \", especially for my high contrast photography, because i doubt that the 40 mp of the two new leica cameras will give me anything but increased cost and possible problems with camera shake. with regard to the latter, have you seen some of the posts by @steven, who found that shooting with the m10-r he had camera shake at shutter speeds below 1/250 sec. some luf posters claim that they can handhold the m10\u2013r at 1/60 and even 1/30 sec. however, as i often go for \"immediacy\", i doubt that i would be able do that on a consistent basis with the m10-r or the m10-m without ibis, even if it could work for me for some images. in this respect, i'm encouraged to see that leica has introduced the s2-s with a 24 mp sensor, which i hopes indicates that there could be a 24 mp. but all this goes back much further for me. on the old compuserve photo forum, as well as on the old leica forum on photo.net, people used to say that if you wanted to print larger than 11\u00d714 inches you should go to medium format. but i have always liked the \"35mm aesthetic\". around 2005, i saw a moriyama daido retrospective at the gallery of new south wales, which showed 60 large prints (60 by 40 inches) shot with tri-x and printed with an epson wide format printer. the prints were dazzling, and didn't need medium format film. a few years ago, moriyama had another exhibition at the cartier foundation in paris: this was all digital work that he shot with a camera that had a tiny sensor, the nikon coolpix 6500, i believe. indeed, i made a print from the ricoh grd at 58 x 45 inches print that i like a lot. and, of course, i have 60 by 40 inch prints made from the m10 without any problem. but that is the, usually, high-contrast, expressionist, and \"rougher\" look that i like. of course, i understand that other photographers will prefer a 40 mp camera. the other issue you referred to is that of a color camera versus an m-monochrom. when i had the m-monichrom, i also had a m9-p. essentially, i shot then alternately in \"binges\" of month, or so, each. when i reviewed my b&w images from these two cameras, i found ones i liked from both; but i concluded that i preferred the flexibility of using \"digital filters\" in lightroom or silver efex with the camera to shooting with the monochrom and sometimes using glass filters. and of course, all the leica monochroms are great cameras and i understand who people like them. ________________________frog leaping photobook", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 24131, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 368617, "autor": "a.noctilux", "date": 1638117660000, "content": "\ud83d\udc4d Don't your M-Rokkor 28mm have some white spots ?

I've found my skills are rusty ... the fundamental intentions are there but some of the habits have been lost. So I'm treating my M9 like a new-to-me camera. Here's one interesting thing I've found that I wasn't even aware of beforehand: the difference between compressed and uncompressed raw files. Background: the M9 offers raw and JPEG formats; raw files can be either compressed or uncompressed. The compressed files are half the size of the uncompressed files, so this is not a data-oriented lossless algorithm (like .zip files) nor a visually oriented lossy algorithm (like .jpg files). My understanding is that the uncompressed values are bit-shifted to fit 8-bit containers, which is a very fast operation for computers to perform (and bit-shifting a 16-bit value to an 8-bit value is mathematically the same as taking a square root). Then, when processing the raw file, those 8-bit values are expanded to 16 bits. A raw value of 255 (clipped white) becomes 255^2 = 65,025, a value of 254 becomes 254^2 = 64,516, and so on until a raw value of 2 becomes 4, with 1 and 0 unchanged. Thus there are gaps between the possible values that the raw photo processor can interpret, much like tines in a comb: it simply isn't possible for an 8-bit raw value to tell the image processor that the captured value was 3 or 65,026. If you then turn around and output a .jpg file, the image will be re-compressed to 8 bits and the image is, as far as this goes, unchanged. However, if you manipulate the photo, you're theoretically losing out on a fair amount of precision that might cause visible artifacts. (Note that the sensor package outputs 14-bit values, so the range of values actually lost is not as large as going from 16 to 8, but remains numerically substantial. Yet is it photographically significant?) Previously, I had assumed that truncating each datum meant that lost data was taken from the shadows, so I tested by pushing images and looking for artifacts. I never found any, so I always shot compressed images. Upon this reanalysis, I am convinced that I was wrong: information is lost evenly throughout the entire range of values. To test for visual effects, I took several photos of a corner of a room with a white wall with gradual tonal transitions. That wasn't useful. But, the photos did include a few wall hangings, and while not in precise focus there is enough detail for me to draw conclusions adequate for my purpose. Comparing two shots with the same exposure and similar framing, one compressed and one uncompressed, I used Rawtherapee to apply absolutely minimal adjustments -- no sharpening, no noise reduction, and the \"fast\" and simple demosaicing method. I took white balance off the same spot in each image. Then, to simulate the kind of image processing that could theoretically cause issues, I applied a fairly steep, but not unreasonable, curve. I examined the images on a high-DPI but not photo-specific monitor. Then, to simulate more realistic conditions, I applied my usual demosaicing settings but did nothing else, e.g. with sharpening, noise, etc. Finally, I desaturated the images because I almost exclusively work in monotone. There are seven attached images (I'm not sure how to inline images I'm uploading to the site): The curve used. Basic raw processing, uncompressed file. This has the tall, flat histogram. Basic raw processing, compressed file. This has the jagged histogram. Normal raw processing, uncompressed file. This image is rotated slightly clockwise of its counterpart. Normal raw processing, compressed file. In addition to rotation, this image's histogram has a green bump just before going hitting the right edge. Normal raw processing, desaturated, uncompressed file. Normal raw processing, desaturated, compressed file. Note 1: the \"basic raw\" images have a raw-value histogram that does not change with image processing; the \"normal raw\" images have histograms that reflect the full image. Note 2: in the crop view, the blue and brown fields are under the steep parts of the curve, while the wall and shadows areas are not. The raw histogram makes it obvious that the compression does indeed take place throughout the entire range of possible values: the bottoms of those comb-like jaggies indicate where there are no values at all, whereas the uncompressed image indicates the presence of a relatively continuous range of values. On inspection of the basic images, the differences are far subtler than the histogram might suggest. What I see are smoother gradients and less noise. This was predictable: when the compressed value drops just one increment in one channel while the other channels stay the same, the image processor sees a fairly large change that indicates a meaningful change in the color. Something I did not predict was that continuous lines of moire -- optically inevitable aliases along edges -- are more pronounced due to the increased precision of the uncompressed file. Furthermore, the compressed image appears slightly sharpened; I triple checked that this was not a Rawtherapee setting. Still, the raw compression has visual artifacts that I do not like -- when viewed at 400%. Inspecting the normally processed color images, the differences become yet more subtle. I use the LMMSE (linear minimum mean-square estimation) demosaicing method due to how well it handles aliasing on these anti-alias-filter-free cameras, and LMMSE also removes a lot of the compression-induced aliasing. The compressed image still appears lightly sharpened. Notably, the highest resolution features in the compressed image lose most of their color saturation. My sense is that the compressed image also has slightly more impulse noise, but I learned a lot time ago that comparing noise from two crops like this is absolutely unreliable; true noise is random, so you need a large sample size to get a sense of the actual distribution. My takeaway is that the uncompressed image retains better color fidelity at high resolution, and retains more consistent edge transitions. (Remember, this part of the frame is slightly out of focus.) There's just more magenta in the compressed image.. this might be worth inspecting in relation to high ISO traits. Turning to the final pair, the monochrome images, the difference ... remains about the same. At this point, I'm wondering if the sharpness difference isn't due to change in focus precision between shots. (Perhaps now you see why subscribing to Sean Reid's reviews is money well spent. He has these issues locked down.) But that hypothesis does not explain the unsharp-mask-like behavior that I see: a slight overcompensation to lightness when transitioning from dark to light structures. Regardless, the compressed file still seems to yield a slightly noisier tonal fields and has jaggier aliasing; the highest resolution structures have more consistent contrast in the uncompressed file. Now, the penultimate test: zoom out and see if I notice any differences. At full-screen, roughly the size of my prints, I can tell that there's no need for the ultimate test -- prints. I won't be able to tell them apart. At 100%, though, I'm compelled to say that there is a difference. I haven't found a way to illustrate it, but my impression is that the uncompressed file is more Monochrom-like: it looks less like a crowd of pixels and more like a coherent photo. Of course, I've spent 3 hours with these images and so my psychology training tells me that I'm reliably unreliable at this point: I've made my interpretation and my brain will see those for me whether or not they actually exist. Hopefully I've shown you enough to either recognize it as a non-issue (or obvious issue) for your purposes, or perhaps I've offered an indication of how you can effectively conduct your own tests to make your own determination. But storage is cheap, I shoot slowly, and I can no longer pretend that there's no difference at all between compressed and uncompressed. Crop a bit, draw a steep curve over part of the range, and these issues, which look like moire or chromatic aberration, will start showing up. If I could reduce a lens issue with a larger memory card, I certainly would; that's effectively what's happening here. If I was shooting an event and running into buffer limitations, I'd absolutely start using compressed DNGs: half the size means half the write time. Or, if I needed to conserve space for some reason, the compressed DNGs are still excellent (they've served me well this long!) and far superior to JPGs. But consider me converted: uncompressed from here on. At least until I get a more advanced camera with a reasonably modern (lossless) compression method. --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323261-compressed-vs-uncompressed-m9-dng/?tab=comments#comment-4250223", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": " over the last 16 months, i have taken almost no photos -- the longest such period for me in decades. i've found my skills are rusty ... the fundamental intentions are there but some of the habits have been lost. so i'm treating my m9 like a new-to-me camera. here's one interesting thing i've found that i wasn't even aware of beforehand: the difference between compressed and uncompressed raw files. background: the m9 offers raw and jpeg formats; raw files can be either compressed or uncompressed. the compressed files are half the size of the uncompressed files, so this is not a data-oriented lossless algorithm (like .zip files) nor a visually oriented lossy algorithm (like .jpg files). my understanding is that the uncompressed values are bit-shifted to fit 8-bit containers, which is a very fast operation for computers to perform (and bit-shifting a 16-bit value to an 8-bit value is mathematically the same as taking a square root). then, when processing the raw file, those 8-bit values are expanded to 16 bits. a raw value of 255 (clipped white) becomes 255^2 = 65,025, a value of 254 becomes 254^2 = 64,516, and so on until a raw value of 2 becomes 4, with 1 and 0 unchanged. thus there are gaps between the possible values that the raw photo processor can interpret, much like tines in a comb: it simply isn't possible for an 8-bit raw value to tell the image processor that the captured value was 3 or 65,026. if you then turn around and output a .jpg file, the image will be re-compressed to 8 bits and the image is, as far as this goes, unchanged. however, if you manipulate the photo, you're theoretically losing out on a fair amount of precision that might cause visible artifacts. (note that the sensor package outputs 14-bit values, so the range of values actually lost is not as large as going from 16 to 8, but remains numerically substantial. yet is it photographically significant?) previously, i had assumed that truncating each datum meant that lost data was taken from the shadows, so i tested by pushing images and looking for artifacts. i never found any, so i always shot compressed images. upon this reanalysis, i am convinced that i was wrong: information is lost evenly throughout the entire range of values. to test for visual effects, i took several photos of a corner of a room with a white wall with gradual tonal transitions. that wasn't useful. but, the photos did include a few wall hangings, and while not in precise focus there is enough detail for me to draw conclusions adequate for my purpose. comparing two shots with the same exposure and similar framing, one compressed and one uncompressed, i used rawtherapee to apply absolutely minimal adjustments -- no sharpening, no noise reduction, and the \"fast\" and simple demosaicing method. i took white balance off the same -----> spot !!!  in each image. then, to simulate the kind of image processing that could theoretically cause issues, i applied a fairly steep, but not unreasonable, curve. i examined the images on a high-dpi but not photo-specific monitor. then, to simulate more realistic conditions, i applied my usual demosaicing settings but did nothing else, e.g. with sharpening, noise, etc. finally, i desaturated the images because i almost exclusively work in monotone. there are seven attached images (i'm not sure how to inline images i'm uploading to the site): the curve used. basic raw processing, uncompressed file. this has the tall, flat histogram. basic raw processing, compressed file. this has the jagged histogram. normal raw processing, uncompressed file. this image is rotated slightly clockwise of its counterpart. normal raw processing, compressed file. in addition to rotation, this image's histogram has a green bump just before going hitting the right edge. normal raw processing, desaturated, uncompressed file. normal raw processing, desaturated, compressed file. note 1: the \"basic raw\" images have a raw-value histogram that does not change with image processing; the \"normal raw\" images have histograms that reflect the full image. note 2: in the crop view, the blue and brown fields are under the steep parts of the curve, while the wall and shadows areas are not. the raw histogram makes it obvious that the compression does indeed take place throughout the entire range of possible values: the bottoms of those comb-like jaggies indicate where there are no values at all, whereas the uncompressed image indicates the presence of a relatively continuous range of values. on inspection of the basic images, the differences are far subtler than the histogram might suggest. what i see are smoother gradients and less noise. this was predictable: when the compressed value drops just one increment in one channel while the other channels stay the same, the image processor sees a fairly large change that indicates a meaningful change in the color. something i did not predict was that continuous lines of moire -- optically inevitable aliases along edges -- are more pronounced due to the increased precision of the uncompressed file. furthermore, the compressed image appears slightly sharpened; i triple checked that this was not a rawtherapee setting. still, the raw compression has visual artifacts that i do not like -- when viewed at 400%. inspecting the normally processed color images, the differences become yet more subtle. i use the lmmse (linear minimum mean-square estimation) demosaicing method due to how well it handles aliasing on these anti-alias-filter-free cameras, and lmmse also removes a lot of the compression-induced aliasing. the compressed image still appears lightly sharpened. notably, the highest resolution features in the compressed image lose most of their color saturation. my sense is that the compressed image also has slightly more impulse noise, but i learned a lot time ago that comparing noise from two crops like this is absolutely unreliable; true noise is random, so you need a large sample size to get a sense of the actual distribution. my takeaway is that the uncompressed image retains better color fidelity at high resolution, and retains more consistent edge transitions. (remember, this part of the frame is slightly out of focus.) there's just more magenta in the compressed image.. this might be worth inspecting in relation to high iso traits. turning to the final pair, the monochrome images, the difference ... remains about the same. at this point, i'm wondering if the sharpness difference isn't due to change in focus precision between shots. (perhaps now you see why subscribing to sean reid's reviews is money well spent. he has these issues locked down.) but that hypothesis does not explain the unsharp-mask-like behavior that i see: a slight overcompensation to lightness when transitioning from dark to light structures. regardless, the compressed file still seems to yield a slightly noisier tonal fields and has jaggier aliasing; the highest resolution structures have more consistent contrast in the uncompressed file. now, the penultimate test: zoom out and see if i notice any differences. at full-screen, roughly the size of my prints, i can tell that there's no need for the ultimate test -- prints. i won't be able to tell them apart. at 100%, though, i'm compelled to say that there is a difference. i haven't found a way to illustrate it, but my impression is that the uncompressed file is more monochrom-like: it looks less like a crowd of pixels and more like a coherent photo. of course, i've spent 3 hours with these images and so my psychology training tells me that i'm reliably unreliable at this point: i've made my interpretation and my brain will see those for me whether or not they actually exist. hopefully i've shown you enough to either recognize it as a non-issue (or obvious issue) for your purposes, or perhaps i've offered an indication of how you can effectively conduct your own tests to make your own determination. but storage is cheap, i shoot slowly, and i can no longer pretend that there's no difference at all between compressed and uncompressed. crop a bit, draw a steep curve over part of the range, and these issues, which look like moire or chromatic aberration, will start showing up. if i could reduce a lens issue with a larger memory card, i certainly would; that's effectively what's happening here. if i was shooting an event and running into buffer limitations, i'd absolutely start using compressed dngs: half the size means half the write time. or, if i needed to conserve space for some reason, the compressed dngs are still excellent (they've served me well this long!) and far superior to jpgs. but consider me converted: uncompressed from here on. at least until i get a more advanced camera with a reasonably modern (lossless) compression method. --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 31334, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 370039, "autor": "pop", "date": 1628010420000, "content": "vor 16 Minuten schrieb darylgo: Can we generalize these findings to other Leica cameras that use DNG compression?

Leica M9 is not a very popular camera in my country, I live in Chile, South America, I don't think there are more than a few dozen in the whole country. The camera actually traded it to its previous owner for a 1.4 35mm voitglander and a 28mm viewfinder, as he only shoots with film and hadn't used it for a long time. In turn, he had bought it second-hand so he didn't know much about the camera. At the time of making the exchange, check the basics of the camera including some images and note that at apertures lower than 5.6 the sensor problems were not visible, so since I usually shoot with very open diaphragms and that it was a bargain, I gave it much more importance. The truth is that now I am worrying more about the subject not so much about the results of the camera for me, because I do not use it in conditions where sensor problems are evident, but rather because I have fallen in love with the leica system and I am looking forward to selling this camera to upgrade to a Leica M 240 or M10 which allows me to use my R lenses and other non-rangefinder lenses. I don't know how much I can get for the camera in these conditions (everything else works perfectly) but for now I have commissioned a sensor cleaning kit so that after having cleaned it well, I can see that it is dirt and that it is corrosion, if any.

I ended up giving it, along with a 7A 35mm f2 to a friend and colleague of mine, a young professional photographer. I told him to run it until the wheels fall off and he's making great use of it. But $1500 for a corroded M9? No way. That's the kind of info I wish to hear, a fair price for a corroded sensor M9. Now I've found another seller with a nice silver M9 with new sensor, and interested to trade with my silver M240. I'm doing a lot of research right now, I hope it's not an awful decision to make as both camera seems to price similarly nowadays (with the M9 sometimes cheaper but harder to find a silver one).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/319279-m9-with-original-sensor-still-worth-a-shot/?tab=comments#comment-4168655", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spots", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "4 hours ago, 84bravo said: $1500 for an m9 with a corroded sensor is a bit high imo. that said, i seldom see them much cheaper than that. under $1k with little or no visible corrosion would be okay and use it as is until intolerable. if the corrosion is manageable and the cost is under $1000 then it's a decent user camera that can either be fixed later by a third party or discarded. about a year ago i bought an m9 for well under $1000 that showed a couple of minor -----> spots !!!  that basically looked like some minor dust on the sensor. i ended up giving it, along with a 7a 35mm f2 to a friend and colleague of mine, a young professional photographer. i told him to run it until the wheels fall off and he's making great use of it. but $1500 for a corroded m9? no way. that's the kind of info i wish to hear, a fair price for a corroded sensor m9. now i've found another seller with a nice silver m9 with new sensor, and interested to trade with my silver m240. i'm doing a lot of research right now, i hope it's not an awful decision to make as both camera seems to price similarly nowadays (with the m9 sometimes cheaper but harder to find a silver one).", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 31489, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 370206, "autor": "tobey bilek", "date": 1618149780000, "content": "If you wish to take a chance on wasting your cash, go ahead.

For a first lens, I would say consider a 35mm or a 50mm. The 35mm is a great universal lens. Some people tend to shy away from the 35 at first, thinking it's too wide. The thing with the 35 is learning to use it correctly. Learn to tale a couple of steps closer to your subject in order to fill the frame. \"Zoom with your feet\" as the saying goes. The 50 is also a good choice, and a lot of people are already familiar with the 50mm focal length. A 50 is the other side of the coin with regard to the 35 - you still need to zoom with your feet in some cases, but in reverse. Back up a couple of steps. With fixed focal length lenses, it is an absolute must to learn how to properly frame your subject by moving the camera and your body closer or farther away from your subject in order to get good composition and proper framing.

I choose to use a meterless camera because it allows you to concentrate on the composition and be more in the moment. With the latitude film has, minutely adjusting settings to make sure the correct LED lights up is a hugely distracting part of the picture taking experience. My approach is based upon maintaining that \"experience,\" rather than getting every shot perfectly exposed. First off, if I am shooting something I cannot miss, I shoot digital. If I am shooting slide film, I take a camera with an accurate meter. However, if I am shooting negative film, lately I feel more comfortable and free with a meterless camera. 5%~ of the time, I am shooting a tricky lighting situation - landscapes with high contrast, light coming through windows, etc. In this case, I'll use my iPhone and the free Lumu Light Meter app, which is very simple to use and has a spot meter. Pulling out an iPhone to use in conjunction with my M4 is the last reason I bought an M4, so I rarely do this. 15% of the time, if I know I will be shooting across a lot of lighting situations (frequently going indoors to outdoors, especially in sunny/tropical areas with a lot of contrast), I'll stick a KEKS EM-01 on the camera and use that. I don't love it, but I like it better than an in-camera meter because I can ignore it much easier. The rest of the time, I use a Sekonic L-208 (I have one that tends to overexpose by half a stop, which is great for film). I'll take two readings in incident mode - one in the sun and one in the shade, and then put it away. Is the object mostly in the sun? Shoot with the first reading. Is the object in the shade, or do I want to capture details in shadow? Shoot with the second reading. If it's cloudy and the sun comes out, I generally remeter. If the sun gets covered by clouds, I go up one stop. If the clouds are really thick, I go up two stops. Once the sun starts going down, I remeter (or take out the KEKS EM-01). The great part about that is that you really start to realize how accurate Sunny 16 really is and you can start guessing correct values without even metering. You'll also realize how much in-camera center-weighted meters can throw you off, depending on how you use them. The L-208 is fantastic because it's relatively inexpensive, has no misc. features not needed for still photography, is lightweight, and best of all, it displays the whole possible combination of shutter speeds and f-stop for a given light reading, making it an excellent learning tool. The only lightmeters in camera that I really love are the needle style ones, like the K1000 or the Olympus OM-1 - I would kill for a Leica with one of these. They feel completely non-distracting when you're trying to take a picture (I feel like a K1000 is a perfect companion to my M4 at about 1/20 of the price). I never liked the shutter button doubling as a meter reading and I rather dislike the red LEDs (at least the Leica is tasteful - Contax G2 feels like a rave going off in there).

I sent it in for repair to get it looked at, and it came back even smoother and cleaner than my M7. It took awhile, but not super long. I live in Iceland so it makes everything take longer. Another story would be that of my grandmother, who bought a Leica IIIb in Germany in the early 1930s on a trip. She passed away in the late 90s, and the camera had been unused for decades. My relatives gave it to me in the 2010s, and I sent it to Sherry Krauter for a cleaning and lubrication (Leica does not work on screwmount anymore), as it had not been serviced in 80 years or so. When I sent it in, the finder was cloudy and the speeds off, but it worked. When it came back the finder was crystal clear and the speeds spot on. Leica film cameras are well built devices.

I am just trying to understand your reasoning here. So, in effect you tend to use a kind of shutter priority method, which, if I'm honest, doesn't sound simple at all. In any case, the AE mode in the M7 is aperture priority. Maybe due to this misunderstanding you would recommend the M6 over the M7? The actual benefit of using aperture priority is that you maintain creative control over depth of field. It's quite nice, you should try it sometimes \u2013 just saying. Of the 30 odd film cameras I own, about a third of them have aperture priority AE. For a broad centre weighted meter pattern I am fine shooting this way, but for a semi spot meter like the Leica I prefer to work in manual. I find that using AE lock and exposure compensation dials is slower than just dialing in the exposure in manual on many cameras. Sometimes with Ae cameras I have the bad habit of treating the camera as a point and shoot. I find that using manual mode forces me to put more thought into exactly what I am metering. The M6 meter pattern is unforgiving in my experience. If you accidentally have the spot over a highlight or shadow the exposure will be incorrect. I usually try to guess the exposure from the lighting conditions first and make depth of field decisions by choosing a faster speed if I want shallower depth of field. There are usually only 3-4 plausible hand-held exposure combinations for a given lighting situation so the creative control aspect is often overstated in my opinion. The above may sound complicated but I have found that I am not tweaking the exposure much in a given shooting session. The first guess exposure from sunny 16 is usually about right and the meter just gives confirmation. I find the learning experience rewarding. The M cameras inspire me to work in a more traditional way, and there is nothing quite like the clockwork precision of the purely mechanical models.

The MA has no meter. Which M body you use does not really make a huge difference if you are shooting film, so if you are open to used, you might do well to look at an M6, which is a great camera with a functioning meter and otherwise fully mechanical operation. If the battery runs out, it works just like the MA...with the bonus that you always have a functioning meter if you want one. An MP would be another. Personally I think the M7 was the best film M, as the stepless AE shutter is perfect for slides and it has the quietest shutter of them all, as the slow speeds are electronically controlled. It would also be the most similar to your M10M in interface (same finder style, for the most part). The only kick with the M7 is that it is more prone to electronic issues than earlier M's, for obvious reasons. I think the trade-off is worth it, in this sense, but if you don't, the M6 or MP are very good choices. As for the lenses, there are many vintage Leica, Canon and Nikon lenses for Leica thread mount and M mount that will be easier to adapt to an M body. When you are shooting film, the biggest issue is generally focus and rangefinder calibration. It is much harder to dial in because you cannot check your files quickly or easily, and you do not have an EVF to rely on. Focus shift is also a bigger issue in older lenses, and it can be a bit maddening to deal with. If you are looking for an old Leica lens with crazy bokeh and a vintage palette, the 50mm 1.5 summarit is a good choice (also the most dense/heavy lens for its size...beautiful circular iris, fast and low contrast with a lot of glow, but still has sharpness. Usually needs calibration to focus accurately). For a more general purpose lens, the collapsible summicrons are fun to use and have a beautiful look, while still being quite practical and sharp enough for most use. Hello Stuart... Thank you for the informative reply. (This is such a great forum). I've been shooting a lot of MF film too...I have a Hassy System camera and lenses, and also have been playing with a Shen Hao 6x17 view camera, and others with no meter. I\"m getting pretty good at Sunny 16 and varying off that...I've been practicing that actually on my M10M...I seldom use the meter internal to it (I forget it has one). I have a good sekonic spot meter I\"ve been using and I bought the Nick Carver metering system class and am getting pretty decent at my guesses. I bought into the Kickstarter of the latest Reveni Labs Spot meter offering: Reveni Labs Spot Meter Kickstarter I was thinking the Reveni small meter they previously put out that is tiny and will mount on a hot/cold shoe might be a good addition to the MA...? I was looking at M4-P's pretty hard...and M6's, but goodness the prices on the M4-P's are about $2K and the M6's are often hovering near the $3K mark. I found a MA used near the $4K mark and I\"m thinking that that extra $$ is worth getting a camera that isn't 30+ years old....for longevity and it has sort of the best of all the previous M cameras in it. I also like the MA as that it is unmarked and highly \"stealth\". I live in New Orleans and well, with crime the way it is in the recent year or so, I'd just as soon not call attention to myself with red dot cameras. I enjoy my M10M for that reason too!! I was thinking it would be funny that reaching in my bag, I'll have think a bit on which one I\"m grabbing....with or without film advance lever. Thank you for the info...I've started looking and Mr. Leica on YouTube had excellent reviews and praise for the older Canon LTM lenses...I'll check out the Nikon offerings too. Right now, I have the Voigtlander 35mm Ultron (1)....and the Voigtlander 50mm APO, so I'll keep the 35 on the M10M and use the 50 on the MA for the most part I think.

(this is such a great forum). i've been shooting a lot of mf film too...i have a hassy system camera and lenses, and also have been playing with a shen hao 6x17 view camera, and others with no meter. i\"m getting pretty good at sunny 16 and varying off that...i've been practicing that actually on my m10m...i seldom use the meter internal to it (i forget it has one). i have a good sekonic -----> spot !!!  meter i\"ve been using and i bought the nick carver metering system class and am getting pretty decent at my guesses. i bought into the kickstarter of the latest reveni labs spot meter offering: reveni labs spot meter kickstarter i was thinking the reveni small meter they previously put out that is tiny and will mount on a hot/cold shoe might be a good addition to the ma...? i was looking at m4-p's pretty hard...and m6's, but goodness the prices on the m4-p's are about $2k and the m6's are often hovering near the $3k mark. i found a ma used near the $4k mark and i\"m thinking that that extra $$ is worth getting a camera that isn't 30+ years old....for longevity and it has sort of the best of all the previous m cameras in it. i also like the ma as that it is unmarked and highly \"stealth\". i live in new orleans and well, with crime the way it is in the recent year or so, i'd just as soon not call attention to myself with red dot cameras. i enjoy my m10m for that reason too!! i was thinking it would be funny that reaching in my bag, i'll have think a bit on which one i\"m grabbing....with or without film advance lever. thank you for the info...i've started looking and mr. leica on youtube had excellent reviews and praise for the older canon ltm lenses...i'll check out the nikon offerings too. right now, i have the voigtlander 35mm ultron (1)....and the voigtlander 50mm apo, so i'll keep the 35 on the m10m and use the 50 on the ma for the most part i think. i've got my eye on the voigtlander 75mm 1.5 lens...which should cover me very well on both cameras for modern lenses, and then leave me fun to explore the vintage ones ya'll have been suggesting. thank you everyone so far for all the great insight and info...and thanks for you patience, i\"m just learning all this stuff. cayenne", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 3017, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 390878, "autor": "Charles Morgan", "date": 1622186760000, "content": "3 minutes ago, 250swb said: nostalgia noun a sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in the past 2 years ago, I visited the Leica Park in Wetzlar.

If you look thru the range/viewfinder window while you are focusing you will notice that the frame lines & rangefinder patches move from the top left of the image area to the bottom right corner when you are focusing from further away to somewhere closer. This is the mechanism correcting for parallax for you. If your M2 is displaying the 35mm frame lines then your 40mm Summicron should be capturing less on the negative than you see in the range/viewfinder frame lines. On the other hand: 40mm Summicrons, unless they have been altered, generally key the 50mm frame lines in \"M\" cameras. This means the lens would capture more on the film than you see in the 50mm frame lines in the range/viewfinder window. Some 40mm Summicrons have been altered to key the 35mm frame lines.

I also have Pentax MX, Minolta XD7 and Nikon FM2 and they are all about the same size and weight as the OM cameras give or take a few 10s of grams. A lot of people bang on about Olympus viewfinders being amazing but I don\u2019t think they are anything particularly special in the high magnification, low eye relief class. I think the XD7 is the best in that class, and Pentax MX also very good. I generally prefer slightly lower magnification and higher eye relief like Leica R6 and Pentax LX. A weak point for the OM4ti was that they used butter as a priming layer before applying the paint. The paint flakes off just by sneezing in the direction of the camera. Another thing I don\u2019t particularly like is the film advance. Mine has a distinct two stage feel, with an initial stage with little resistance and then the final stage which almost feels crunchy.

This was long ago, circa 2007. The only issues I ever took with Putts is that he was generally a lab bench tester, as opposed to someone like Tom A who developed beliefs/ reached conclusions by actual use of the items in the field. Not saying one is better then the other, but I tend to gravitate to the latter, but each had their biases. Anyway, if any one is interested, just search \"M Build Quality\" on the rangefinder forum. Here's a portion of the discussion thread: It is difficult to narrow down issues like build quality. It depends on usage and care more than anything. Today we expect our DS M3\"s to work perfectly after 50+ years! My own experience of the various M's is as follows: M3/ Early double stroke ones. The shutter brake tends to give up and you occasionally find them with either black rangefinder patches or severely faded \"half\" mirrors. It is still the M with the smoothest advance and the softest release of them all. Later single stroke M3's are among the best built cameras ever. If it has been serviced regularly and not abused, they tend to work perfectly, even after 1000's of rolls. The weak spot is the finder. They can black out through de-lamination of the prism (usually through impact). M2/ Because it is a simpler camera, there are less things to go wrong. The finder is robust and though it can dim through oxidization of the mirrors, it can still be fixed. The advance on some of the earlier M2's (button advance) could get rough with heavy use. If the shaft springs are worn, you can get overlap on the negatives when the shaft turns inside the take up spool. M4/ leica put everything into this camera! It is very well built, but check for bent re-wind cranks and worn take up \"tulips\". The finder usually hold up well and has the advantage of having many parts in common with the M2 and later M4P's and M6's. It is usually easier to find a \"mintish\" M4 than M2/M3 as these earlier Leica were the only game in town for press photographers in the 50's. In the 60's the SLR came into play and the pro's switched, mainly because of the ease of using long lenses. M5/ I have had several of these, but I never got along with it. Too big and a bit clumsy. Again, the mechanicals are very good, though the bottom rewind can act up and one of mine decided not to retract the meter arm. Interesting object cluttering up the sky on a whole roll!. The meter sensor can age badly (like most of us) and loose sensitivity and it does use the #625 style battery too. M4-2/ The earliest of these had a problem with the shutter brake and the shutter speed regulator would go 'kabloonk\" occasionally. Part of the problem was mis-communication between Wetzlar and Midland. The good news is that most of the M4-2's available now have been fixed. Leica started to add a lot of shims to the various shafts and locks and with time these springs shims get tired and you get misaligned locks on the base plate and interior drives. The film rewind was made from alloy and would bend or \"buckle\" if you hit it. The M4-P/ This is a generally good camera and it can take a lot of film. The problems with the shutter was rectified. The film rewind is still alloy and occasionally you have to replace it(expensive) or simply bend it back and file off the flange at the bottom. I still have my 1981 M4P and it has had 10 000's of rolls through it. It was my bench tester for Rapidwinders and also primary camera for a lot of trips. The inter mediate drive (motor coupling) came apart once and was replaced and the gear in the advance wore out and was replaced. A couple of curtains got pin holded (not the cameras fault). M6/ The first version of the M6 had problem with the meter \"chip\" and they frequently died or showed only one of the diodes. Leica replaced most of these under warranty in the mid 80's and after that the M6 is as good as even the earlier M2/M3/M4's. It is a very robust cameras, the alignment in the rangefinder can go out if you bang it hard, but this is rare. There have been problems with a 'grommet\" that seals the meter information transfer wires and you could get light leaks. Some of the Titanium M6's had a film counter spring that failed and needed to be replaced. M6TTL/ Initially these cameras had a problem with battery drain. There are a couple of contacts at the bottom of the battery well that would drain the batteries in a matter of hours. The solution is to push these contacts down, below the surface of the bottom. These are \"test\" connections for probes. Otherwise the TTL is a good camera and as most confirmed M-users prefer the old style shutter speed dial, a good deal too. On a couple I had problems with information transfer from the back door to the diodes (both after having been banged hard against unyielding car doors and door frames). MP/ Early MP's had a faulty seal around the eye-piece and dust would seep in to finder. It was fixed and Lieca actually supplied new and improved seals to \"do it yourselfers\". Thre was a bit of a flare problem in the finder with the 0.85 and 0,72 versions that could cause problems. Other wise I think that the MP is one of the best built Leica M's ever. The top plate is brass as a Leica top should be, the gears are remarkably smooth (film advance on a MP rivals that of a Double Stroke M3} and the fact that you have a choice of finder magnification adds to the attraction. M7/ I had one for a couple of years and apart from going through batteries at an alarming rate and a tendency to shut down suddenly, it held up well. The electronics worried me though and the magnetic controls of the shutter would be sensitive to a heavy Gauss field ( a large electric motor starting up). I never liked the release on the M7 - very \"jagged\" feel to it. I loved the 32 second long exposure count though. general problems encountered with M4-2/M4-P and some R6's. The top was made from die-cast zinc alloy and if you got a scratch that penetrated the plating the top turned into a galvanic element and started to bubble the black chrome. More common on the R6, but I have seen some M4-2 and M4-P's with the same problem. The shutter curtains on old M's can dry out and get brittle and the adhesive that holds the 'straps\" for the curtains to the shutter drum will loose 'power\" with age and can come loose. There is also a felt trap in the track of the M's (up to M4P) that can came loose and jam the shutter curtain. It is again adhesive that gos brittle with age. It is aiways a good idea to CLA any older M' on a regular basis anyway (every 5-7 years) and beware of M's that have sitting idle for a long time. Lubricants dry out and curtains loose flexibility if they are not used. What is remarkable is not the problems that occasionally occur with older M's - it is how well they still work after 40 or 50 years! There are few products available today that can claim that. Even battered old M3's and M2's will produce great pictures after decades of use. So the shutter speeds might be a bit off, learn to compensate, the finder could be brighter - use hyper focal, the rewind squeels a bit - dont worry, it will wear it self in! AND there a few products that have compatibility going back 80 years. You can put your nickel Elmar from 1927 on your 2007 MP or even on the M8. That is foresight in design and, yes a bit of german stubborness too - but it all benefits us, the users. __________________ Bests to Everybody, Tom Ahttp://flickr.com/photos/rapidwinder/ Edited May 9

After inspection though, the shutter curtain has weird pressure spots. Is this normal? Does this happen to (barely used) M cloth shutter curtains?

Very handy since it allows one \"freebie\" uncoded lens that is always corrected ID'd, even when swapping back and forth quickly with coded lenses. E.G. I have 5 coded lenses (three by Leica, two C/Vs by hand), and one uncoded 135 Tele-Elmar-M (no coding pattern even exists). I leave the camera set to auto-detect, and the menu set \"permanently\" to \"135 Tele-Elmar-M f/4.\" When I mount a coded lens, the camera automatically reads its code. If I mount my uncoded 135, the camera automatically detects \"no code\" and automatically reverts to the \"135 Tele-Elmar-M\" menu setting. As seamless as if the 135 was actually coded. Swap lenses back and forth, back and forth - never visit the lens menu at all any more. I believe this extended feature was only introduced with the M10.

MUSINGS OF A DISTURBED LEICA MIND: This looks like a cracker of a lens. I started out shooting 28mm/2 on the M8 as a standard 35mm focal. Then the M9 came out and I got the 35mm/2 Summicron + 50/1.4 Lux. That seemed like the standard kit, but eventually that 28mm Summicron kept ending up on the M9, 240, and the M10 more and more.

So, I sold the 35/2 Summicron as it was a fine lens and I did like the OOF rendering but, it just never got used, I did especially like the size, though. And, to complicate and really mess up my mind I had bought along the way a current version 35mm/1.4 Summilux... both the first and second version(kept the ver.II). And, I still didn't shoot much with the 35 Summilux. Then Jono reviewed the new version II of the 28mm/2 Summicron several years ago, and it was such an improvement from my version 1. I sold my version 1, bought the version 2 and am very happy with it. Now, this APO 35 comes alone and it seems like I'm just going to have to wrestle with that obsessive side of my mind whispering to me. When, really, I just wish the 28/1.4 Summilux wasn't so blessed large! Favorite chicken picture ever was from that lens! I used to think the 28 Lux was too big as well. Well, I still do. But using it for a month made me completely forget about the weight. It's a legendary lens, and could possibly become my favourite lens of all time. It's so special.

I\u2019m hesitant to use the word glow because I think that is overused manner of describing spherical chromatic aberrations, when describing lenses. But away from center, wide open you are not likely to satisfy any descriptor that includes sharp. In practice, that means, if you wish to use this for portraits wide open and you\u2019d like an eye to be sharp, it best be near the center of the frame. However, as you start stopping down, sharpness and contrast increase dramatically, far more than I expected from the Noctilux that preceded the f 1.0 version. The best way I can describe it is that the lens rapidly changes personality as you stop down, getting sharp and contrasty throughout the whole frame while out of focus areas remain drastically different from more modern and highly corrected lenses such as the Summilux and of course the APO Summicron.

The pandemic still being one (availability of parts). others being: working with 10 very small elements, in a very small, tight-tolerance mount; some of the glass used to achieve the APO performance is hard to work with (softer glass, needs careful handling and protective coatings during assembly - and testing to make sure the lens won't change over time; some glass is also subject to corrosion before coating - more special handling, extra training, slow production ramp-up) Karbe notes that essentially every one of the 35 APO elements is \"unique\" in one way or another - aspherical surface or extraordinary glass properties and so on. This was also the answer to a question of why the 35 APO is so much more expensive then the regular Summicron ASPH - it is difficult and time-consuming work. Production was not \"stopped\" at any point - just takes a long time. How long per lens, he woud not say. Similar reasons given to explain the cost of the 75mm Noctilux f/1.25. II) \"Best\" lens Leica currently makes - still the 35 APO-Summicron-SL. The M version tries to equal the SL in a much smaller size - almost (but not quite) succeeds. Nevertheless, overall, the S-system lenses are the best performers as a group (although a part of that is the larger sensor), but SL lenses often offer a wider focusing range retaining peak performance due to the floating designs. Comparing 28 Summicron-SL to 35 APO-Summicron-SL - 35 still wins. Karbe notes that, for the Barnack format (24x36mm), the 35mm focal length in general requires less volume to create a great lens - it is a \"sweet spot.\" He asks everyone to compare the M Summilux-ASPH lenses for example - 90 is larger than 50 is larger than 35, and then 28 and 24 (RIP) and 21 are also larger than 35. Given the consistent size of the SL lenses, the 35 focal length had the most \"elbow-room\" for more aberration corrections. Karbe does not mention a \"favorite\" lens or design (not asked). III) The Fifth Generation of Leica M lens design (following classic, ASPH, FLE and now APO) will be \"Squeezing the lenses down.\" Using new technologies to reduce size. He is looking at a variety of tech options, but won't reveal exactly which ones. It will always take time - it took over 20 years to get from the 90mm APO-Summicron to the 35 APO-Summicron. IV) How has computer-aided design (CAD) changed? - many more parameters or variables can be controlled now. Leica can \"virtually prototype\" not only the glass, but also the mount engineering, and even run simulations of what to expect in actual production - \"Producability\" is always a factor in the design of a lens. Computers now aid in measurements during production (a big problem for the original 50mm f/1.2 Noctilux, and the 35mm double-aspherical). Computers can help reduce the number of elements (too many elements can degrade \"bokeh\" or introduce more places for production errors.) Leica does still produce two real prototypes (A and B - optics and mount) to check the computer predictions. Leica rarely has to \"go back to the drawing board\" once the prototypes are tested. One really interesting point - computers are now so fast that Leica can do some \"Monte Carlo\" lens design. Instead of the designer choosing and entering every parameter (glass type, surface curvatures, spacing, etc. etc.), the computer itself can insert random numbers for those parameters (within specified limits) and run 1000 or more subtly-different versions of a lens design - just to see what happens. The human designer still makes the final decisions. Karbe likes to go back through all Leica's historical designs to see how his predecessors handled various problems. Every new lens project gets an in-house \"B-number\" (for Max Berek) - over at Leica Microsystems the lens design projects get \"L-numbers\" named for some designer of the past on the microscope side. Leica does not use MTF (contrast x resolution) as a goal or tool in lens designs - they use individual curves for specific aberrations. In answer to a question about how Leica can predict the \"soul\" of a lens even in the design stage, Karbe says the patterns of aberrations and how they will affect the \"drawing\" of a lens become recognizable with experience, or by looking back at older lenses. Some specific questions raised: 3) Does a Monochrom make different demands of a lens than color cameras. What are the differences? - Not really. The Monochrom has more effective resoluton (no interpolation of pixels) so in principle it may need a better lens. But the designer is still working with all the color wavelengths from 400-700nm for either B&W or color images. Color aberrations may be less obvious with a Monochrom, but they will still produce blur. Color aberrations are more correctible with color images in post-processing (e.g. defringing tools). That cannot be done with Monochrom images, since the colors cannot be distinguished. But using color filters on the lens with the Monochrom will remove aberrant colors if chosen carefully - e.g. a green filter will eliminate red/purple aberrations. 4) Does the introduction of close-focusing in the 35mm APO signal that the RF has reached a limit? - The 35 APO works fine with a rangefinder, but with the availabilty of live-view, we can extend its capabilities. The close focus was not in the original specification from the product managers, but once we showed it could be done while retaining excellent close-up performance, it was added to the design. 5) Any difference using M lenses on SL vs. M? - very little, but performance on the M is slightly better due to the thinner cover glass for which the lenses are intended. Some people use the \"S\" brand - and have problems. 7) Why no lenses for the SL longer than 280mm? - Not my decision. Ask the product managers . In the meantime, with the higher-resolution sensors, cropping is a better option than using a tele-converter - additional glass always introduces additional aberrations. 9) What is the Leica philosophy or priority for color rendition? - Really this is now more a camera consideration than a lens consideration. We simply try to render \"naturally\" to minimize the need for any post-processing - including in monochrome. This was of course even true before digital - keep the tricks needed after exposure as small as possible. It is always a balancing act. 12) Why nothing wider than 16mm, especially for M street photography? Would 10mm be a challenge? - I don't decide which lenses to make. It depends on the market, not optical difficulty. A 10mm would not be hard - doesn't require \"rocket science.\" 17) Leitz 0.8 Cinema lenses - Does Leica build these? Are they the same as the Leica lenses? We noticed color differences in side by side tests. - Leitz Cin\u00e9 Group took over assembly. So far as I know, the design is the same. I would have to ask Leitz Cin\u00e9 if they have made any changes. 18) People who used the original Leitz 50mm Noctilux f/1.2 say the colors I am getting from the new version are nicer. Is that a difference in coatings, or just digital vs. film? - The coatings today are different, of course. We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible, but there are some materials, including glass types, no longer available. Glass transmission today is higher than in the past. Older lenses are yellower. 19) There is an ancient belief that zooms are not as good as prime lenses, but that seems to be less and less true. What is that due to? Design? Materials? - Zooms have more elements. Which allows for better corrections, but also more stray light. But yes, new glasses and aspheres mean we can get much closer with zooms to primes. Today zooms do perform very well - the compromise is in the size. 20) Can you explain the concept of \"light flux\" and why it is so important? - Light flux is the amount of light you put through the lens system.The more light flux you have, the more information. Especially about 3D structures, through depth of field. If one changes sensor size - let us say to Micro-Four-Thirds - you may pick an \"equivalent focal length.\" But you also have to think about the lens opening. A larger sensor and a longer lens (e.g. 35mm vs. 17.5mm) will distinguish 3D space differently. The lens for M43rds may be f/1.4 - but will only produce the background blur and 3D appearance of a Leica M 35 f/2.8. The inverse is true for a larger format - the f/2.5 lenses of the S System equal the blur and spatial definition of f/2.0 lenses on the M system. 22) How do you ensure that within the Leica company the knowledge is prepared for the next generation of designers? There is so much historical lnowledge and experience...how do you pass that on? - (edited long answer) i have young colleagues here in my group and they are prepared. I myself have studied the core competence of Leica and try to pass that on.....When I first started at Leica, I had to go and look at all the (previous) designs I could get from the past...we look at (those designs) and think, \"OK what would they do today if they had the capabilites we have today?\" And that gives us the next step, Ja. 23) Wouldn't it make more sense to avoid FLE and use live-view in close-focus to reduce focus shift? - Focus shift is produced by spherical aberration. And spherical aberration is not only bad for focus shift, but also other lens performance. That is the real reason for FLE - it is a side-effect that FLE also reduces focus shift. I would like to stay with floating elments. 24) On the 75 f/1.25, the difference between 5m and 20m (focus scale) is very, very small. It is very difficult to focus this lens with the rangefinder. Compared to the 75 Lux: the Lux is much easier - the mechanical focus is very big. - You would like to have more sensitive focusing from infinity to 5m, and this has to do with the turning angle between infinity and 5m. Yes, this is a good point. This is a balance between how much turning we need for the whole (focus) range and how much for the long focal distance. I understand your aspect, and this is the reason - our product manangement said we want to have a total angle for focusing of less than 270\u00b0. 25) I like to use the Tri-Elmar 28-35-50. It is very a complicated lens and out of production. Do we have the sensor and optical power today to replace it with a Bi-Elmar 28/50 or 35/70, much smaller, and crop for other focal lengths? - Yes, you are right. But it is again a question of the numbers of production. No, no, no - I am not allowed to talk about future projects! But it is important to give feedback to our product managers. Please give (Vincent?) or someone else at Leica what you would wish to see. Yes, higher resolution ennables us to do some things different. Using a high-resolution prime lens is even faster than zooming - just push a button and crop. Or take two pictures with one shot - the wideangle image and the telephoto image. 26) Is it possible to make SL zoom lenses without autofocus, that are then more compact? Does this make sense to you? - Yes, but (again) it depends on the market size. 27) Do more and more Chinese M lenses, at apertures very close to Leica's, present a long-term risk for Leica and our Leica lens portfolios? It worries me to see those cheap copies everywhere! - The good news is that we are not alone in the M market. And if there is competition, we feel challenged. The core values we try to realize are based on durability, quality, robustness, and those are very, very expensive values. Take all the lenses made for Leica (over the decades), and you can still use them. This is the durability - you still feel connected (to the past). And we want to deliver this still. My proposal is, if you compare it, compare it wide-open. Compare it in robust situtations. And then have a look at the higher-resolution parts of the image. The durability of the lenses - this is very important for Leica to deliver. It's not for free. (long historical discourse on the challenges Leitz/Leica has encountered in the past: Canon and Nikkor LTM lenses in the 1950s; SLRs and near-death of the M system in the 1960s-70s; making digital work with M lenses, instead of changing the lenses to work with digital, \"Original Mirrorless;\" no AA filter. etc) \"It's good to see that what Leica stands for, in lightness and compactness, is the trend today.\" Edited July 10 by adan", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/322474-if-you-could-ask-peter-karbe-one-question/page/9/?tab=comments#comment-4235641", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "here goes - questions and answers edited for clarity or length - the first four are \"compilations\" from similar questions: i) production and availability of the 35mm apo-summicron-m asph - production is slow because of many things. the pandemic still being one (availability of parts). others being: working with 10 very small elements, in a very small, tight-tolerance mount; some of the glass used to achieve the apo performance is hard to work with (softer glass, needs careful handling and protective coatings during assembly - and testing to make sure the lens won't change over time; some glass is also subject to corrosion before coating - more special handling, extra training, slow production ramp-up) karbe notes that essentially every one of the 35 apo elements is \"unique\" in one way or another - aspherical surface or extraordinary glass properties and so on. this was also the answer to a question of why the 35 apo is so much more expensive then the regular summicron asph - it is difficult and time-consuming work. production was not \"stopped\" at any point - just takes a long time. how long per lens, he woud not say. similar reasons given to explain the cost of the 75mm noctilux f/1.25. ii) \"best\" lens leica currently makes - still the 35 apo-summicron-sl. the m version tries to equal the sl in a much smaller size - almost (but not quite) succeeds. nevertheless, overall, the s-system lenses are the best performers as a group (although a part of that is the larger sensor), but sl lenses often offer a wider focusing range retaining peak performance due to the floating designs. comparing 28 summicron-sl to 35 apo-summicron-sl - 35 still wins. karbe notes that, for the barnack format (24x36mm), the 35mm focal length in general requires less volume to create a great lens - it is a \"sweet -----> spot !!! .\" he asks everyone to compare the m summilux-asph lenses for example - 90 is larger than 50 is larger than 35, and then 28 and 24 (rip) and 21 are also larger than 35. given the consistent size of the sl lenses, the 35 focal length had the most \"elbow-room\" for more aberration corrections. karbe does not mention a \"favorite\" lens or design (not asked). iii) the fifth generation of leica m lens design (following classic, asph, fle and now apo) will be \"squeezing the lenses down.\" using new technologies to reduce size. he is looking at a variety of tech options, but won't reveal exactly which ones. it will always take time - it took over 20 years to get from the 90mm apo-summicron to the 35 apo-summicron. iv) how has computer-aided design (cad) changed? - many more parameters or variables can be controlled now. leica can \"virtually prototype\" not only the glass, but also the mount engineering, and even run simulations of what to expect in actual production - \"producability\" is always a factor in the design of a lens. computers now aid in measurements during production (a big problem for the original 50mm f/1.2 noctilux, and the 35mm double-aspherical). computers can help reduce the number of elements (too many elements can degrade \"bokeh\" or introduce more places for production errors.) leica does still produce two real prototypes (a and b - optics and mount) to check the computer predictions. leica rarely has to \"go back to the drawing board\" once the prototypes are tested. one really interesting point - computers are now so fast that leica can do some \"monte carlo\" lens design. instead of the designer choosing and entering every parameter (glass type, surface curvatures, spacing, etc. etc.), the computer itself can insert random numbers for those parameters (within specified limits) and run 1000 or more subtly-different versions of a lens design - just to see what happens. the human designer still makes the final decisions. karbe likes to go back through all leica's historical designs to see how his predecessors handled various problems. every new lens project gets an in-house \"b-number\" (for max berek) - over at leica microsystems the lens design projects get \"l-numbers\" named for some designer of the past on the microscope side. leica does not use mtf (contrast x resolution) as a goal or tool in lens designs - they use individual curves for specific aberrations. in answer to a question about how leica can predict the \"soul\" of a lens even in the design stage, karbe says the patterns of aberrations and how they will affect the \"drawing\" of a lens become recognizable with experience, or by looking back at older lenses. some specific questions raised: 3) does a monochrom make different demands of a lens than color cameras. what are the differences?

This was also the answer to a question of why the 35 APO is so much more expensive then the regular Summicron ASPH - it is difficult and time-consuming work. Production was not \"stopped\" at any point - just takes a long time. How long per lens, he woud not say. Similar reasons given to explain the cost of the 75mm Noctilux f/1.25. II) \"Best\" lens Leica currently makes - still the 35 APO-Summicron-SL. The M version tries to equal the SL in a much smaller size - almost (but not quite) succeeds. Nevertheless, overall, the S-system lenses are the best performers as a group (although a part of that is the larger sensor), but SL lenses often offer a wider focusing range retaining peak performance due to the floating designs. Comparing 28 Summicron-SL to 35 APO-Summicron-SL - 35 still wins. Karbe notes that, for the Barnack format (24x36mm), the 35mm focal length in general requires less volume to create a great lens - it is a \"sweet spot.\" He asks everyone to compare the M Summilux-ASPH lenses for example - 90 is larger than 50 is larger than 35, and then 28 and 24 (RIP) and 21 are also larger than 35. Given the consistent size of the SL lenses, the 35 focal length had the most \"elbow-room\" for more aberration corrections. Karbe does not mention a \"favorite\" lens or design (not asked). III) The Fifth Generation of Leica M lens design (following classic, ASPH, FLE and now APO) will be \"Squeezing the lenses down.\" Using new technologies to reduce size.

I understand your aspect, and this is the reason - our product manangement said we want to have a total angle for focusing of less than 270\u00b0. 25) I like to use the Tri-Elmar 28-35-50. It is very a complicated lens and out of production. Do we have the sensor and optical power today to replace it with a Bi-Elmar 28/50 or 35/70, much smaller, and crop for other focal lengths? - Yes, you are right. But it is again a question of the numbers of production. No, no, no - I am not allowed to talk about future projects! But it is important to give feedback to our product managers. Please give (Vincent?) or someone else at Leica what you would wish to see. Yes, higher resolution ennables us to do some things different. Using a high-resolution prime lens is even faster than zooming - just push a button and crop. Or take two pictures with one shot - the wideangle image and the telephoto image. 26) Is it possible to make SL zoom lenses without autofocus, that are then more compact? Does this make sense to you? - Yes, but (again) it depends on the market size. 27) Do more and more Chinese M lenses, at apertures very close to Leica's, present a long-term risk for Leica and our Leica lens portfolios? It worries me to see those cheap copies everywhere! - The good news is that we are not alone in the M market. And if there is competition, we feel challenged. The core values we try to realize are based on durability, quality, robustness, and those are very, very expensive values. Take all the lenses made for Leica (over the decades), and you can still use them. This is the durability - you still feel connected (to the past). And we want to deliver this still. My proposal is, if you compare it, compare it wide-open. Compare it in robust situtations. And then have a look at the higher-resolution parts of the image. The durability of the lenses - this is very important for Leica to deliver. It's not for free. (long historical discourse on the challenges Leitz/Leica has encountered in the past: Canon and Nikkor LTM lenses in the 1950s; SLRs and near-death of the M system in the 1960s-70s; making digital work with M lenses, instead of changing the lenses to work with digital, \"Original Mirrorless;\" no AA filter. etc) \"It's good to see that what Leica stands for, in lightness and compactness, is the trend today.\" WOW WOW WOW ! It's better to read you that to listen to him. You made it clearer and more interesting than the two hours talk.

- many more parameters or variables can be controlled now. leica can \"virtually prototype\" not only the glass, but also the mount engineering, and even run simulations of what to expect in actual production - \"producability\" is always a factor in the design of a lens. computers now aid in measurements during production (a big problem for the original 50mm f/1.2 noctilux, and the 35mm double-aspherical). computers can help reduce the number of elements (too many elements can degrade \"bokeh\" or introduce more places for production errors.) leica does still produce two real prototypes (a and b - optics and mount) to check the computer predictions. leica rarely has to \"go back to the drawing board\" once the prototypes are tested. one really interesting point - computers are now so fast that leica can do some \"monte carlo\" lens design. instead of the designer choosing and entering every parameter (glass type, surface curvatures, spacing, etc. etc.), the computer itself can insert random numbers for those parameters (within specified limits) and run 1000 or more subtly-different versions of a lens design - just to see what happens. the human designer still makes the final decisions. karbe likes to go back through all leica's historical designs to see how his predecessors handled various problems. every new lens project gets an in-house \"b-number\" (for max berek) - over at leica microsystems the lens design projects get \"l-numbers\" named for some designer of the past on the microscope side. leica does not use mtf (contrast x resolution) as a goal or tool in lens designs - they use individual curves for specific aberrations. in answer to a question about how leica can predict the \"soul\" of a lens even in the design stage, karbe says the patterns of aberrations and how they will affect the \"drawing\" of a lens become recognizable with experience, or by looking back at older lenses. some specific questions raised: 3) does a monochrom make different demands of a lens than color cameras. what are the differences? - not really. the monochrom has more effective resoluton (no interpolation of pixels) so in principle it may need a better lens. but the designer is still working with all the color wavelengths from 400-700nm for either b&w or color images. color aberrations may be less obvious with a monochrom, but they will still produce blur. color aberrations are more correctible with color images in post-processing (e.g. defringing tools). that cannot be done with monochrom images, since the colors cannot be distinguished. but using color filters on the lens with the monochrom will remove aberrant colors if chosen carefully - e.g. a green filter will eliminate red/purple aberrations. 4) does the introduction of close-focusing in the 35mm apo signal that the rf has reached a limit? - the 35 apo works fine with a rangefinder, but with the availabilty of live-view, we can extend its capabilities. the close focus was not in the original specification from the product managers, but once we showed it could be done while retaining excellent close-up performance, it was added to the design. 5) any difference using m lenses on sl vs. m? - very little, but performance on the m is slightly better due to the thinner cover glass for which the lenses are intended. some people use the \"s\" brand - and have problems. 7) why no lenses for the sl longer than 280mm? - not my decision. ask the product managers . in the meantime, with the higher-resolution sensors, cropping is a better option than using a tele-converter - additional glass always introduces additional aberrations. 9) what is the leica philosophy or priority for color rendition? - really this is now more a camera consideration than a lens consideration. we simply try to render \"naturally\" to minimize the need for any post-processing - including in monochrome. this was of course even true before digital - keep the tricks needed after exposure as small as possible. it is always a balancing act. 12) why nothing wider than 16mm, especially for m street photography? would 10mm be a challenge? - i don't decide which lenses to make. it depends on the market, not optical difficulty. a 10mm would not be hard - doesn't require \"rocket science.\" 17) leitz 0.8 cinema lenses - does leica build these? are they the same as the leica lenses? we noticed color differences in side by side tests. - leitz cin\u00e9 group took over assembly. so far as i know, the design is the same. i would have to ask leitz cin\u00e9 if they have made any changes. 18) people who used the original leitz 50mm noctilux f/1.2 say the colors i am getting from the new version are nicer. is that a difference in coatings, or just digital vs. film? - the coatings today are different, of course. we tried to keep it as close to the original as possible, but there are some materials, including glass, no longer available. glass transmission today is higher than in the past. older lenses are yellower. 19) there is an ancient belief that zooms are not as good as prime lenses, but that seems to be less and less true. what is that due to? design? materials? - zooms have more elements. which allows for better corrections, but also more stray light. but yes, new glasses and aspheres mean we can get much closer with zooms to primes. today zooms do perform very well - the compromise is in the size. 20) can you explain the concept of \"light flux\" and why it is so important? - light flux is the amount of light you put through the lens system.the more light flux you have, the more information. especially about 3d structures, through depth of field. if one changes sensor size - let us say to micro-four-thirds - you may pick an \"equivalent focal length.\" but you also have to think about the lens opening. a larger sensor and a longer lens (e.g. 35mm vs. 17.5mm) will distinguish 3d space differently. the lens for m43rds may be f/1.4 - but will only produce the background blur and 3d appearance of a leica m 35 f/2.8. the inverse is true for a larger format - the f/2.5 lenses of the s system equal the blur and spatial definition of f/2.0 lenses on the m system. 22) how do you ensure that within the leica company the knowledge is prepared for the next generation of designers? there is so much historical lnowledge and experience...how do you pass that on? - (edited long answer) i have young colleagues here in my group and they are prepared. i myself have studied the core competence of leica and try to pass that on.....when i first started at leica, i had to go and look at all the (previous) designs i could get from the past...we look at (those designs) and think, \"ok what would they do today if they had the capabilites we have today?\" and that gives us the next step, ja. 23) wouldn't it make more sense to avoid fle and use live-view in close-focus to reduce focus shift? - focus shift is produced by spherical aberration. and spherical aberration is not only bad for focus shift, but also other lens performance. that is the real reason for fle - it is a side-effect that fle also reduces focus shift. i would like to stay with floating elments. 24) on the 75 f/1.25, the difference between 5m and 20mm (focus scale) is very, very small. it is very difficult to focus this lens with the rangefinder. compared to the 75 lux: the lux is much easier - the mechanical focus is very big. - you would like to have more sensitive focusing from infinity to 5m, and this has to do with the turning angle between infinity and 5m. yes, this is a good point. this is a balance between how much turning we need for the whole (focus) range and how much for the long focal distance. i understand your aspect, and this is the reason - our product manangement said we want to have a total angle for focusing of less than 270\u00b0. 25) i like to use the tri-elmar 28-35-50. it is very a complicated lens and out of production. do we have the sensor and optical power today to replace it with a bi-elmar 28/50 or 35/70, much smaller, and crop for other focal lengths?

I've never seen any evidence to show that the 'white spots' do very much harm unless the lens is heavilyaffected when (IIRC) the worst that happens is contrast is reduced and there is more tendency to flare. I've not used one myself but many of the posters in the link you have provided are sensible chaps and, in the main, they seem to like the lens very much. If a clean(-ish) one can be found it might well be worth a try. After all; they are relatively inexpensive (in LeicaLand terms) and they will always have a target audience on the used market should it prove to be unsatisfactory. Exactly. Great little lens indeed. Not as small as the Elmarit asph but not far. Very Mandleresque as you say, matches very well Leica lenses from that era and even later ones like the current Summicron 50. Similar optical quality to me but less acutance than the Elmarit asph. My Rokkor has some white spots on the black coating of the rim but they are almost invisible there and totally invisible on photos. The hood Arnaud's referring to is superb and works like a ZM or CV one. Only issue the lens triggers 35mm frame lines on rangefinders which could be a deal breaker for newbies (including truly yours ) incapable of guesstimating FoVs. FWIW.

Thanks Philipp for the detailed info. None of my Leica lenses are coded, and as you've pointed out I'm sure that because of this I would have immediately have noticed that this lens was coded, had it arrived to me either 'properly' coded, or DIY coded from a previous owner . This is good to know. None of my other lenses are coded (and let's presume this one isn't either), and they all show 'Leica R Adaptor'. So I just interpret this to be 'unknown lens', since I don't have an R adaptor. The same EXIF data reading appeared when I used one of my lenses on my friends M10R, so I don't think this is particular to my camera, it is perhaps common for uncoded lenses. For the lens in question, the camera was certainly recognising it previously as a 35 Summicron. If that was through dirt on the flange then it would seem unlikely (although not impossible) that it 'guessed' it correctly (I know that's not what you were suggesting and that you were talking in general terms about how the coding and reading works). So let's presume that the naming information is not coming from the lens, it must be manually set on the camera. The curious thing is that the M10-D doesn't have this functionality (unlike other digital M's). Or at least if it does it's not common knowledge ... many others on this forum don't think it does / don't know how to do it . Despite this, if it was done at the camera end then it certainly wasn't manually input by myself because I don't know how to do it. So it would've had to be done by a previous owner with the same lens and for it to have been the last one they manually entered, in the way you explained. Seems unlikely especially given the M10-D not having this functionality, but maybe not impossible. Understand that it's not voodoo but with these parameters it's quite hard to determine how/where this lens was getting named into EXIF . I'm curious as to what the technician says regarding whether they cleaned off anything from the flange but I just can't imagine having this lens and not noticing that kind of DIY. And the previous owner also said it's not 6-BIT coded. All things considered, maybe the real mystery is how someone manually coded a lens-type into an M10-D. Or some dirt on the flange was indeed being 'read' as the correct lens by some stroke of luck, and is now clean.

On an RFF post it is said: \"Most are designed for saturation, contrast and impact. The Hex 50mm is not.\" Now that is interesting wording too. For me the 40mm M-Rokkor fits clearly in that sweet spot. It is also remarkably sharp to the edges. On some 40mm M-Rokkor pictures I found that in a shot with the focus at 2 meters, a high-rise building in the background on the side was blurred in the centre (bokeh..) but in the far corners all at once the field gave a sharper and in the last mm an almost sharp rendering. I read the designer [team] who was responsible for this lens also had worked on a Noctilux (same effect) and on the 35mm AA. Nice heritage. I have the impression the 50mm Summicron V3 was also nicely balanced; with a higher micro-contrast albeit slightly lower resolution. I had the lens. I thought the V5 was sharper . . it was. The M240 sensor is very sharp - design focus evidently was on resolution. But to me the M8 CCD had a perfect balance of micro-contrast and resolution. I find the 40mm M-Rokkor gives me a little bit of that M8 look again. How does this lens stand out against the 35mm Summicrons? Yes it is lovely (the 40) I really like it. Interesting to read your comments about the v3. I think mine may not be a great copy or need a service because it's not particularly sharp - so much so that on a grainy film like Tri-X it just lacks bite and appears soft. I find mine low contrast (although that's relative, in comparison to my 35:2 v4 and 40:2). Despite this I do like it but just not for the purposes I've mentioned in this thread. And may like it more after a CLA if it has an issue . I think with the 50:2 v4/v5 reputation aswell as unanimous recommendations in this thread it could be a good choice. I don't know whether to celebrate or commiserate that my 40 'cron' is so unique and hard to emulate To answer your comment about the 35 crons ... I only have the v4 but did some side-by-side with the 40:2 and the 35 was close \"but not that close\" . I imagine the increased contrast makes the 40:2 appear sharper also but at 100% crops there was no contest really in the side by sides. In practice though these aren't a bad pair and I like the 35:2 v4 . I wonder also if the 40mm FL versus 35mm assists in giving the 40mm some perceived punch in the images over the 35mm. I'm a newbie so unsure if that has merit.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it I have two 50s and two 35s because there is enough difference in their image quality, for each focal length, to warrant them, let alone the size differences. They all render beautifully, in their own way.

But I would never buy gear because of anyone else. And, as said, I have the ZEISS which is the complete opposite of the Voigtlander, I love it but I don't use it very often, even it's \"better\". And I want to warn people of buying such expensive stuff if they use it only for personal stuff and may regret the decision (as many before). I spot so many Leica cameras / lenses on the used market that are not older than 2 months, this clearly shows that many are buying way too quickly and regret it afterwards.

Nice to see the steel rim there : ) I was a bit torn between the Steel Rim and 8e for a while but I think the Steel Rim does everything the 8e does, while being slightly smaller (I think but might be wrong) and also looking better (external design wise), and it provides a unique rendering at f1.4 beyond the 8e capabilities.

Me wanting to sell the Noct f1 is more than just it's lack of use, as I use my 75lux even less. Last year a went about a lens cull and sold half my lenses because they sat unused. Some were limited edition stuff that I'd baby too much. Sometimes I'd use those \"extra\" lenses for the sake of it and I've also had a bit of bad luck with these \"superfluous\" lenses (those lenses which overlapped with my core group i.e. 35lux/50apo/28cron) in the past as I've had a couple of them develop wobbly lens barrels, oil on blades, nicks on the lens barrel and sometimes obvious dust finds their way into the lenses despite my fastidiousness in relation to my gear. As a result, I feel \"less gear = potential less issues\". While I regret selling some of them because they're difficult to find now and prices have climbed, I've never really been in it for the money/investment aspect but more for different looks and qualities. This is why I kept the Noct f1 in spite of it being a bit more of a rarity nowadays compared to my other lenses. It's signature is just so unique. I must say the cutting down of lenses has made me happier and in this fresh bout of wanting to cut down I've also considered selling my M10-D (leaving me with just an M10M). The idea of a trimmer lineup makes photography more enjoyable for me because it's easier to not be distracted by choice, though I suppose this isn't really the issue at hand because I'd be replacing the Noct f1 with another lens. That said, if it were a lower cost alternative i'd be less inclined to baby the lens and might bring it out more, particularly if its lighter and there is some appeal there. The Noct f1 makes an easy target to sell because of the existence of the 75lux in my kit and my preference to its rendering despite the focal length. Also, the whole love-hate relationship with the Noct f1, as I usually don't have that many gripes with a lens I intend to keep long term. On the flip side, I must say I'm more inclined to keep the lens now than before. It's a lens for mood days and I'm more of a Karbe guy (though in my heart it's the Mandler glass that I really have a soft spot for, e.g. 75lux and this Noct), so even if i had something smaller i don't think i'd use it that much more. I wouldn't be any happier with the money in the bank. This discussion on a Noct replacement made me remember why I kept it during my cull last year and why it's been my mainstay sole Mandler lens for the past 5 years (until I finally found a 75lux which was perfectly calibrated last year after quite a bit of searching). With the Noct f1, it is full on Mandler, the super charged Mandler lens and the ultimate tonic for my Mandler days. If I only had one Mandler lens, it'd be this lens. As for alternatives suggested, I did try the 50lux BC before in view of replacing the 50lux (standard) I had but stuck with the standard version because I didn't like the added heft. I would consider using one more extensively to re-assess how I feel about it now that my standard 50lux has been sold and because that black chrome 50lux is such a beautiful lens. I don't think it'd be a replacement for the Noct f1 though as I find their signatures too different. IMO same could be said about the Konica Hexanons. I've always wanted to try the 50 1.2 and 60 1.2 (v2) but I've always seen them as add-ons to my lens lineup rather than substitutes. I did own a 35 f2 UC-Hexanon once and really liked the rendering (I presume it shares similar DNA to the fast 50/60mms and from photos I've seen on the web I see some similarities) but it was never a replacement for any of my past or current lenses. I think my best bets for as close a Noct f1 replacement would probably be a 50lux pre-asph, likely a v1 going by the comments and pics I've seen. I'd have to find one to shoot for a more extended period to see if I can sell the f1 for it. Or not touch any of those \"alternative\" lenses at all. Maybe a beater Summar can be found for some fun.

I see NOTHING. This is disheartening. You are not looking at the right pictures. Look some of the great images shot out in the field with this new lens in a few different posts. I sent you a reply to your private message in regards to this as if you or any other shooter on here is expecting Leica 50 1.4 Asph sharpness then you have misunderstood what this new version of the original 1.2 design was ever meant to provide as it is a 1960's lens design. It is however a lovely lens which possesses a very similar rendering to the original 1.2 version as it should, but what I find fascinating is from F2 on up it is remarkably sharper than my 1968 original copy along with much better contrast so its like having two lenses in one, the original rendering at 1.2 and a more capable modern lens from F2 on up. The size of this lens is also fantastic as is the build quality which is the best of any modern Leica alloy bodied lens, very stout, perfect aperture clicks and silky smooth focus action plus it just feels stout and as if it will stand up to a lot of wear and tear.

The Lux and Cron are both German 90's editions, I don't recall which year. All 3 lenses are 9/10 cosmetically although none has been CLA'd - at least not by myself. The Lux is off for a check over and service at the moment so can run a quick side by side when it comes back to see if the (very slight) gap with Cron closes. The Summicron is in particularly nice condition and considering it performed sharply I'd take a guess that it's a decent copy. The Lux really wasn't far behind and the fact that it and the Cron were pretty similar (with regards sharpness) makes me feel the lux is performing as designed but it will be interesting to se if there are any changes after a service. Bearing in mind this was pixel peeping all were very acceptable. The fact that the Minolta was the outlier in performance also makes me think that the Leica's were showing 'expected' performance - eg the 2 Leica's being much more on a par with each other than either was with the Rokkor. Not sure how much the 'obvious' difference would be due to contrast also since the Rokkor was improved with multi-coating for this version (over the CL).

I'd like to see this get better. 2. Eye focus and face focus rarely do what I want them to do, which is to get the focus on the near eye of the person nearest to where I put my spot focus point. I'd like to see this get better. 3. Auto ISO is great, BUT: when I set a minimum shutter speed for auto ISO, this is not a hard limit - if the camera gets to max ISO when I'm in auto ISO mode with manually selected aperture, the camera sets a slower shutter speed than the minimum I set in the menu. This *always* results in a blurry photo in my use case. I'd rather have a noisy photo than a blurry photo; I can work on noise in post. I'd like an option for the shutter speed minimum to be a hard limit, so that the camera just underexposes when the aperture/min shutter/max ISO triangle can't get a proper exposure. 4. Speaking of ISO, in my shooting the highest ISO at which I can reliably get a usable photo after applying noise reduction in post is 6400. This is pretty good (as I said, I'm shooting in VERY dark rooms sometimes), but another stop would be even better. 5.

I will try to answer your questions based on my past experience using the SL280mm with SL2.

If this happens again, try switching over to 'spot' focus mode to see if the focus on your subject can be done precisely. This situation happened to me before therefore whenever I am shooting a stationary bird, I prefer to switch over to MF and use the rear joystick to autofocus the subject or rotate the manual focus ring.

It is not easy as you need to precisely place the box over your subject accurately. trigger your shutter release and watch the box turn green and continue to be green over your subject as the shutter continues to take more frames. Many times the box can jump outside the subject and turn white from green and repeats the same scenario again as you move your frame with the moving subject an even worst case can be the lens suddenly starts focus hunting and you loose view of the subject in the EVF or LCD screen. This means the focus tracking is not successful and you might get a couple of clearly focus pictures over the entire stretch of frames. I had too many of these experiences in earlier firmware and the firmware V3.0 improved the success rate of focus locking and tracking.

This is a great question - at first glimpse it would seem straightforward and easier to shoot the 4x multi-shot. My lens choice was: 75mm APO Summicron-M, 50mm Summicron-M (v.3) or the Panasonic 24-105. 50 was perfect for the landscape 4-shot, 75 for the portrait 12-shot and the 24-105 could be zoomed to do either. All would be shot at f/11 to try for the best resolution and depth of field compromise - corners of all (especially the 24-105) can be ignored as the overlap for stitching effectively excludes any deficiencies. Knowing the final use, I did favour using one of the M-lens options. I think the easiest way to explain it is that the 4x multi-shot file is made up from four image circles and the 12x regular is made up from twelve image circles. Each landscape original is roughly equivalent to 3x portrait originals. Each multi-shot generates more digital information, but the 3x portraits generate more optical resolution.

I have reviewed hundreds of pictures, including those published in this forum. I have noticed that many of them are slightly misfocused. Either the focus was not on he right place (eyes) or they had a bit of motion blur or they were just a bit front or back focused. So the question is: how difficult is to focus with this lens? I am mostly interested in AFs (single). My experience with AFs with the Nikon Z system is very good: it is quick, precise and almost never hunts, even with telephoto lenses. Thank you I use this lens extensively on the SL2 & SL2-S. The issue is that there's an element of shutter slap/shock with mirrorless cameras which is magnified by long tele lenses. A couple of us picked this up quite early on, as you say, images appeared mis-focused or appeared to have motion blur. I found the same issues when I had the Sony A7r & the Lumix S1R. The conclusion was that you should use the electronic shutter. My standard settings for both cameras when photographing wildlife are: Electronic Shutter & focusing set to SPOT & AFS.

The problem is that the flash has to be very close to the subject since the power in HSS is very low, and even more once you ad diffusion in the from of it.

Don't choose the camera according to the weight. So if you really want to use an SL body, do it. Use M lenses or Sigma options to keep your weight manageable.The M series balance better on an SL body and that is a plus point.As some pointed out the M series cameras are almost as heavy. Reading the comments here.... I'm impressed by the intrepid cyclist and hikers who said they carried lots of camera gear with no issues. I also have done extensive hiking at altitude and cycle touring around the world ,I'm also pretty fit and I can honestly tell you..in hot and humid conditions you will NOT want to carry any more weight than is necessary. believe me. In cooler, drier climates, you can do it. Also don't leave anything valuable in hotel rooms. Just don't. hotel rooms are never safe.You just think they are.And to the contributer who said use a phone.. No, no and no. I saw an amazing sunset as I was cycling home from work last week and i only had my phone avasilable. The exposure was either too dark or too light no matter what I focused on and the phone would not pick up the reds I was seeing, plus it was awkward to hold. Fix in post? Nope, i tried it. Nothing like what I saw. Use a camera not a phone with a camera 'function'. CL. perfect for travel, super compact. SL series. good for travel with advantages...full frame, incredible viewfinder, lens versatility etc. Can't go wrong with either. SL2 ( more pixels ) or SL2s ( better low light performance) should be an easy choice, which do you care about? The weakness of every digital camera on the market remains battery dependance, and the only solution is to carry spares. Good luck! Happy adventures. For me, I start with the purpose of the trip and work backwards. For Namibia, for example, I knew there would be some wildlife but mostly people and places. So I took a long zoom and gear that was suited to dynamic moving subjects. If it had been really wildlife focused I would have found a way to carry a supper tele. In Cuba my longest lens was 150mm (120mm equivalent), I prioritised primes over zooms and took a flash. I took a much smaller tripod to Cuba than Namibia because Cuba involved much more walking. Then I consider how important photography is on the trip. For most of my travel, photography is the priority. I can get away with less clothes, shoes etc if I need to. I rarely get on a plane with more than 20kg including carry on and Cameras and tripods could be half of that with accessories, spares and backups. I did do a photography trip where one of the participants had 7kg of gear in total, including cameras and lenses. He didn't check gear at all. I tend to use cameras that charge by USBC so batteries are no longer an issue. A big portable battery pack can charge the camera battery many times, and I can charge in cars planes and trains along the way. If I'm out and photography isn't a priority then I might just take an M10, 28, 50 and 90. If I'm on my mountain bike, I just have a Sony RX1RII stuffed in my bum bag. If I'm travelling in my own vehicle I'll often take two complete systems, because I can. You're spot on about environment and temperature. You've got to know what you can carry in different conditions. If I were hiking overnight I'd carry an M and smaller lenses for sure because I'm also carrying shelter, clothes and food. For wandering around Havanna I can carry 6kg plus bag. That's my limit. Any more and I don't enjoy. A travel kit, to me, is a fluid and flexible term that I adapt to the trip and the potential subjects. That explains why I need a new bag for every trip.

Obviously, I don't know your technique, so correct me if I am wrong. I've found that people who believe this share two traits: they use ETTR (\"expose to the right\"), and they value the ability to recover shadows. There is nothing wrong with either of those traits, at least for stills. For motion work, ETTR means that every shot has a different exposure, which leads to lots of (usually expensive) correction in post. Even then, you'll never get shots to match fully. Your midtones might be the same, but the contrast roll-off in the highlights and shadows will differ. The issue of shadow recovery is an aesthetic one. Often you want some shadows to go fully black in motion work. Many stills photographers prefer to leave their options open, in case they decide on a different interpretation at a later date. The basic concept of ETTR is simple. Start at \"base/lowest ISO\", and decrease the exposure (aka: increase the ISO) so that your brightest highlights do not clip. The end results are surprisingly similar to a shot done with a 400 or 800 ISO base: if you have some strong highlights, you'll need to stop-down by a few stops, which will give you almost the same shutter/aperture combination. The only significant difference is that your highlights are very close to the edge, whereas a cinema-style exposure provides a wider margin. Again, that comes down to time and effort: you never ever want to re-shoot cine work, so you leave some margin for an unexpected highlight/reflection. These differences in metering philosophies used to take place back in the film days.

A friend of mine was lucky to have long term access to one so I\u2019ve tested it out a few times. Video is decent in terms of specs. It\u2019s missing 120fps in HD and 4K but besides that, it will record 12 bit raw from an. atomos which is quite impressive. Not many need it like you said but good to have the option. Video out of the GFX100 system is actually very nice. The lenses do a good job with AF in movie mode depending on the lens. AF for stills is really fast! They say 0.18 sec and it\u2019s there.

Thank you very much for your reply. I didn't expect someone will reply me fast like this! I used Touch AF function sometimes. However, when I take a picture of people who stand quite far from me, it seems the focus block is too big to focus only the eyes. When I touch on the overall face, it looks soft at the eyes. Anyway, I will follow and practice from what you recommened. Really thank you that you explain in detail. \ud83d\ude03 About the mount adapter, can I ask you the brand of your mount adapter? I found the M-L adapter on the online shopping in Thailand but it seems to have closer focus and use manual focus. Is it the same? I've already attached what I found in the attachment.

The 24-90 was my most used lens on the SL2. The cameras performed flawlessly despite rain, snow spray, and cold. Use the lens hood as it is very effective at protecting the lens from spray (but use a clear filter and carry a readily accessible lens cloth - you will need it). The batteries also did very well despite the cold, occasionally needing to go to a second battery on a long Zodiac trip with lots of shooting. The camera was easy to manage even with thick gloves. Remember to put the cameras into waterproof/airtight bags before coming in from the cold to prevent condensation. I only forgot to do so once with one of the cameras - despite the 'waterproofing' I did get condensation in the lens and behind the viewfinder glass which took many hours to clear during which time the camera was unusable. Regarding focusing: I agree setting to AF-S. Rarely used manual.Never used the AF profiles - I guess I could have tried out 'team sports' because of unexpected change in direction (whether you or subject is probably irrelevant but you could experiment with it) I didn't bother, but if the sea is quite rough you may want to use continuous shooting mode, or just us a slightly wider focal length so you can crop or realign the horizon. More importantly, set the focus area to 'field' metering (the small rectangle), I used 'multifield' less often.

In other words, it's like a number of similar \"almost M-compatible\" cameras: it will work with one lens, but not another, and it will never be as good as an M or SL. 2. It's small but chunky and dense, so it feels heavier than it is. It's not a point-and-shoot like a TL or CL. 3. I use the small Sigma grip, and it's OK. 4. That's a personal call. Some people need a viewfinder, and some prefer to look at a bigger screen. Don't get the fp if you absolutely need a viewfinder. I find that it can be quite hard to focus manually in bright light, so it's probably not the best pairing for M lenses (unless you are adept at scale focusing). 5. Not in natural light. You will probably get issues with lights that fluctuate at a high frequency 6. The Sigma 45 is my only AF lens. It works fine I wouldn't use the fp as a walkaround camera for M lenses, unless you are good at estimating your focus and framing (something I do all the time with a 24 or 21). The more I use the fp, the more it becomes obvious that it's a formidable video camera that also shoot stills. Thank you for your replies. I was thinking of it as a smaller camera that I can use with an m lens or one of the smaller sigma lenses (45mm, maybe 35 f2 when it is available), and also the 20-60 panasonic lens that I have (got it with the S5). I realize now of course that it is not that small and maybe carrying an TL2 or even the S5 (if the extra weight is not an issue) may be preferable. When I do street photography I actually use M lenses and estimate the distance fine, but then the electronic shutter may create some distortion if I shoot a moving subject (especially if I move as well). I value great color etc, I wonder if I can find a way to rent it for a week or so to see how it is. I admit that I have a soft spot for Sigma, as I used to use the Merrill DP cameras that I loved...

IMO, you should really only consider the Q over an M if you strongly prefer the 28-35mm focal length. Cropping does not just give lower resolution, but also (equivalent) increases in noise and less DOF control. I do not use the in-camera cropping at all, although I sometimes crop down to ~35mm in post processing to improve framing. In comparison to the M10(M), the Q2M has several major advantages: there is much better eye relief, so even with glasses I can easily see the entire frame the EVF framing is exact, which I find is more important for wider angle shots than 35mm or longer the EVF makes managing exact exposure very straightforward and quick the close-focus/semi-macro capability is a huge plus with a wide angle lens the camera and lens are fully sealed When shooting I mostly use auto-focus in spot mode, with manual aperture, ISO and shutter speed. Using the blinking over-exposure indication, it is very quick and easy to set exposure to what you want - unlike the M10 series when used with the rangefinder. The only downsides, aside from the obvious fixed focal length, appear to be from the lens/optical assembly itself. The lens is perfectly sharp in the centre at all apertures, but this is achieved at the expense of somewhat busy/double-edged bokeh. It is not worse than most competing fast 28mm lenses (including the Summilux-M), but I still prefer the much smoother rendering of the Summicron-M. Another issue is lens flare, which is sometimes problematic. With the sun just out of frame, there is some veiling flare (fogging), which is not objectionable and which can add useful character. However, with the sun directly in frame, there is frequently a small and bright double-spot of light that is almost impossible to avoid and which is quite difficult to remove in post processing if necessary.
