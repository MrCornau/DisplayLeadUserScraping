Apologies in advance for the length of this post! I was wondering if you all are able to give me some advice or words of wisdom on whether I should get a Rangefinder Leica. At the moment I\u2019m currently using and enjoying my Leica CL & 23mm f2 Summicron. Purchased in Oct 2018. I absolutely love shooting with the CL and for me it was the upgrade I was always wanting. I even adapt some rare and unique vintage m42 lenses to it and get some amazing results. Now I\u2019m no professional photographer, just a hobby shooter but the Leica CL I have had really developed my love and passion for photography. At the time of purchasing the CL I was using a Nikon D7500 which I still have (but never use) so for me, at the time the CL was the next step up, and I never thought of going for a rangefinder (couldn\u2019t afford the m10 and lenses anyway lol). But now having visited the Sydney Leica store on many occasions to try out the M10 and the rangefinder systems, I\u2019ve grown more interest for a Rangefinder. I\u2019m interested in the M240, maybe the M262. I like the appeal of a brassing body though (a bit of individualism I\u2019d say). But honestly I\u2019m not sure which system to go for (and I don\u2019t have the money for a new M10). What are the PROS and CONS for each system? What makes you want to stay with that system?

The deal is that there are two classes of B&W film these days (although \"these days\" date back to the 1980s). High-tech \"engineered grain\" films that produce finer grain and better resolution for the same ISO than the films before 1980. But are also rather high-strung and picky about perfect exposure and processing. These would be the Ilford Delta (Delta-grain) and TMax (T(abular)-grain) films. Without getting too technical, the silver-halide crystals are \"grown\" to be flat and thin, but wide to capture a lot of light with a minimum of silver (tabular) and usually delta-shaped (triangular - \u2206). The flat grains also make the emulsion thinner, for better sharpness (less diffusion of light in the \"Jello.\" (BTW - the delta-shape vanishes in developing the crystals into silver grains. You won't see triangles in the final pictures ) The others (Kodak Tri-X, Ilford HP5+, FP4+, Pan F) use \"old-school\" cubic crystals. Grainier and slightly fuzzier for a given ISO, but with more latitude and tolerance for exposure and development variations. Ilford uses a cute trick with FP4+. As a medium-speed film (ISO125), Ilford makes it with a mix of larger \"ISO 400\" crystals and smaller \"ISO 50\" crystals. Averaging out to ISO 125. This gives it extra latitude in high-contrast situations - the big \"fast\" crystals capture more light and tonal detail in the shadows, while the \"slow\" small crystals keep adding tonal density in bright highlights, where the fast crystals are grossly overexposed and have blocked up. Think of it as \"chemical HDR.\" It is the closest thing still made (at least by the big players) to the old Kodak Verichrome Pan, engineered for box-cameras and P&Ss with minimal exposure controls (shutter speeds and apertures) and thus sloppy exposures in varying light. Very forgiving. Ooops - gotta run. But I would recommend FP4+ as a starting point for someone getting back into B&W film. Excellent background info! FP4+ is my favorite film for exactly the reasons you mentioned. I was unaware that this is due to the crystal mix. But it certainly explains it.

I recall someone on the forum a few years ago saying something along the lines of don't treat it as you would a digital file. In what way would you clip the blacks? Just bringing in the black slider on levels? Pete Pretty much, but I used the curves dialog instead. Drag the black point until blacks are visibly crushed in non-important areas (like dark clothes).

To answer your question explicitly, yes for HP5+ shot ISO400 if you develop with rodinal or id-11 for the recommended times, your results will be almost the same in terms of speed. If you're being pedantic and use a densitometer, you'll probably spot a small difference (a bit extra density in the shadows for id-11) which will be imperceptible with naked eyes. If you plan on pushing those films, you'll get better results in every possible way (grain size, contrast, shadow detail) if you use general purpose or pushing developers, instead of Rodinal. You can still try it with Rodinal though, if you have it already, and see how you like the results yourself.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/308086-visiting-maybe-again-developers-for-bw-film/?tab=comments#comment-3945145", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "308086-visiting-maybe-again-developers-for-bw-film", "result": true, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "51 minutes ago, fatihayoglu said: thanks guys, very detailed answers here. however, i still couldn't get answer to my last 2 questions. let's say i took a picture of exposure chart of 13 shades of grey (plus white to black) by exposing to the same grey area with 2 hp5 rolls ei400. if -----> i !!!  -----> develop !!!  them say one in ilford 11 and the other one in rodinal at 20c for given time on the charts, would -----> i !!!  get more or less similar results in terms of exposure (-----> i !!!  know sharpness, grain, etc depends on the used developer)? also, as i have mentioned i usually shoot these films at ei800 or ei1600, which requires me to develop a bit more, so does it mean i simply move right on the chart and develop accordingly. the reason i am asking these, if i don't understand how the developers work for my shooting conditions, i will never be able to start to develop at home. to answer your question explicitly, yes for hp5+ shot iso400 if you develop with rodinal or id-11 for the recommended times, your results will be almost the same in terms of speed. if you're being pedantic and use a densitometer, you'll probably spot a small difference (a bit extra density in the shadows for id-11) which will be imperceptible with naked eyes. if you plan on pushing those films, you'll get better results in every possible way (grain size, contrast, shadow detail) if you use general purpose or pushing developers, instead of rodinal. you can still try it with rodinal though, if you have it already, and see how you like the results yourself.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 101146, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "mikemgb", "date": "2020-04-21 00:55:00", "content": "I've been developing E6 and C41 for years, it's no more difficult that black and white as long as you control the temperatures.

The grain looks within a normal range to me. But could be a bit pronounced due sharpening in the digital process. If he uses a mini-lab-scanner it could be that it is a automated process and he has only rather few possibilities to make changes there, but I don't know. There was a similar discussion in the german forum a while ago where I posted to examples how different TRI-X can look just depending on exposure:https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/235207-rollei-blackbird-was-ist-hier-schiefgelaufen/?do=findComment&comment=2686823 One picture is on the edge of underexposure the other is well exposed. With negative-film underexposure enhances the grain pretty effectively, so don't expose for the highlights like in digital or with slide-film. Depending on the scanner and the scanning software, grain can be also increased strongly with wrong settings. Often it is better to scan without sharpening, but you have to find out. In general I have the impression that scanning B&W films accentuate the grain, while the photographic paper in the classical printing process tend to reduce the grain due to it's slight unsharpness in finest details. But I never proofed this with a test. The developer also has a influence on graininess. As stated T-MAX film could have a much finer grain as the TRI-X with the right developer. But when I use it for example with Rodinal I got a grain nearly as strong as with TRI-X and then I like the TRI-X grain more, because it's sharper. With my fine grain developer T-MAX has tremendous fine grain but only reaches 200 ASA since the highlights get blown if I develop to full speed. There you have to find a good combination. Maybe the most important, the TRI-X of today is not the same as the one in the sixties. When I was a student one of my professors told me that the photographic material has grown worse over the years. Unfortunately I couldn't really proof this because it was not possible to get fresh material from the past, but some experience with old films give me an idea. But a few years ago there was an great exhibition that shows the winers of 50 years of the Deutschen Jugendfotopreis, a competition from juveniles. There it becomes pretty clear: from the 1950ties until 1970 the bw-prints was mostly excellent. No grain, sharp, deep blacks and a great tonality. After 1970 it becomes gray and grainy. And all these pictures was made from pupils that don't have fancy professional stuff, mostly just cheap amateur equipment. So I don't wonder that Jim Marshalls pictures looked much better then today. I guess to get a quality that comes near like the one in the past today you have to use all possible tricks of optimization.

Digital Monochrom gets very clean - digital if you like, files at low ISO and it has the ability to shoot cleaner than film at high ISO with obvious high ISO noise which looks like a film grain - more or less. I like film photography as is, only reason i don't use it as i used to is cost and convenience of digital, plus i didn't have M246 all that long in my photographic life. The M246 needs to pay for itself and shooting and processing rolls of B&W film is not going to do it for me*, home freezer would probably disagree with me. The new M10M brings some advances over the predecessors but for a second i don't doubt that both M9M and M246 have a lot to go for. *Note. After 4 years i shot equivalent of 250 rolls of film, at \u00a320/film, processed and professionally scanned i broke even, I paid \u00a35K for a brand new M246 in January 2016. Leica would love me if I bought new camera but I am not sure what a 50% more expensive camera can do for me. Each person has their own tastes, I know a lot prefer high contrast / clean files, but for me the greatest benefit of the MM1 is to be able to make files look as closely as possible to the results I got from Tri-X / Ilford...something that I feel I have never been able to achieve with color digital images, and that\u2019s why I still shoot color on film. Digital does have a lot of benefits (including cost in the long term as film becomes more and more expensive) that film doesn\u2019t, but to me the most important thing in the end is getting an output I\u2019m happy with.

I have a variation of your situation. Here is my own personal take. In cynical disbelief that the M9 corrosion fiasco would ever be solved by a redesigned sensor (I did not believe this promise), I traded my faithful grey M9 for an M240. It was late 2014. I had loved my M9 (my forum name is testament to that!). The trade-in was in anger at Leica at the time. I vowed to myself I would never buy another digital M. The 240 replacement would be my last. It was one of the factors that led me heavily to film use in the last five years. I learned to develop and wet-print my own film at home - even colour prints. Well, the redesigned M9 sensor came out and it was hat-eating time for me. I hardly ever use my M240 - it is basically a forgotten camera. It is infinitely more flexible and useful as a digital camera than the M9 - live view, electronic spirit level, R-lens capability, even movies. These are nice features to have, but since I rarely use them, the camera sits unused, or rather acts as a lens-testing platform to judge things like haze and bokeh on old lenses. My film cameras have all the fun - the M240 rarely leaves the cupboard, and almost never leaves the house. A few days ago a friend offered me his beautiful black M9P. Like new condition, new sensor, 7k actuations, and a (not low but still reasonable) price (\u00a32,200). I felt an immediate bond to the M9. It feels like a camera I *know and understand* perfectly. And the images are stunning! Holding it and using it was/is a deeply tempting experience. Ultimately, however, I am declining it. For several reasons: 1. Shooting it side by side with the M240 the difference is visible. The M9 makes (to my eye) undeniably more beautiful images. M9 images look \u201cfilmic\u201d right out of the camera. M240 images look dead by comparison, and although I know they can be adjusted in LR, I hate using LR. But is that difference worth buying an M9 again? 2. On the M9 (unlike the M240) my wide angle lenses (notably the Elmarit 28 ASPH, 2011 version, but also the Summilux 21) show a green cast along the edges and corners. The green shows up in overcast skies in landscapes, and in rooms with white walls indoors. I don\u2019t like it, and here prefer the M240, which just gives me neutral colours all the way across the frame. 3. Believe it or not, I still feel sore about what happened with my M9 in 2014. To my mind there was an element of the weasel in Leica\u2019s behaviour with the M9, particularly when they implied that sensor corrosion was a user-fault in wet-cleaning sensors. And when they ignored that my camera was corroded, and it went back and forth between Oxford and Solms before I had to go in person to Mayfair and got a fair solution there, it was infuriating. I am not a forgiving person - I\u2019m sure you are, so forget my point 3. 4. I love film! If the M9 produces files that look filmic, that\u2019s not so much a reason for me to buy another one, than a reason to shoot more film! Anyway, your thoughts may very well vary from mine. I totally see where you are coming from on this M9 dilemma! I look forward to reading this thread. It might even convince me to change my mind and buy my friend\u2019s M9P!

When it became too difficult for me to find a reliable source for 1-gallon E6 chemistry and a good supply of color slide film, I found it much easier to use a digital camera for all my color work. On the other hand, since I still shoot medium format and large format black & white film, it is easy for me to also shoot 35mm b&w film and develop all the film myself.

I have not shot color film in many years since my only option is mailing the film off. Plus the cost of color film and processing. I believe a roll of color film and development and scanning for tiffs is about $30 per roll. 2. Fast shutter speed, either for fast action or shallower DOF in bright scenes. 3. Histogram when the action is fast and light is tricky. 4. I need to chimp to make sure I'm getting the shot, especially focus when it's fast moving action in lower light. Also, camera shake is getting to be more common for me. 5. Ability to change ISO. I often have a film and digital M in my bag, usually with different focal lengths. It gives me options.

Once one uses a Leica, I'm afraid that is the end to that. There is an excellent Instagram thread called Mamiya7ruinedeverything. For FF film and digital there should be one called Leicaruinedeverything. I sold my Q for somewhat similar reasons as you. And if the M can no longer work for you, I agree with jaap.

I use one-shot chemistry for B&W, HC100, Rodinal, and PMK are my favorite, and I will stay with HC100 once my Rodinal and PMK runs out. C41 is not one-shot. The develop drum I have is not convenient for draining the used chemical back to the bottle. I used to use Jobo develop drum but I add to it the DUOLAB type lid (unfortunate, discontinued!) that you can screw the Job chemical bottle to the lid. The development starts with turning bottle-drum pair to pour the chemical into the drum, and stops by turning the bottle-drum pair to drain the chemical back to the bottle. I repeat this for every steps (dev, stop, fix, etc.). (Jobo's recommended setup, CPP or CPE, takes too much space, though it could be more efficient.). Depends on the amount of films to develop, I choose the drum of the right size (1~6 rolls at a time). The whole process is less an hour, not much more than driving to the photo labs (forget it, no longer a choice). Converting to digital file is through a digital camera.

If your chemicals are too hot and also very fresh they can cause this effect. Yes that might be the freshness as I started wit ha new 1 liter kit and put 12 400iso rolls through it. However I got consistently bad results for the most part with 2 or 3 rolls of the bunch coming up ok. I'm leaning towards bad batch from a supplier because sometimes i developed two rolls where one came out alright and the other didn't. Also I have a pretty basic cheap thermometer that's analogue and hard to read accurately. I guess I could have been off perfect 38C\u00b0 by ~1 degree. @250swb do you recon being a bit off on the temperature can give such radically bad results? Contamination is my other suspicion, because I didn't have the bottles labeled properly at first (just the lids) which since then has been corrected. i tried scanning them last night with both a dedicated scanner and an digital camera: unfortunately they are too contrasty and dense - the positives come out as if they were shot on an instant film (very high contrast and colour shifts). It's a great shame because I have 12 rolls of this and they're all in a mixed bag so I can't tell which one is which. Another lesson learned I guess... 6 hours ago, adan said: I tend to go with the \"different shops\" theory, unless you know exactly how they were stored in each store, and for how long, and how old they were (expiration dates). Film stored in too warm an environment can go bad before the expiration date (which assumes, at most, \"room\" temperatures - 72\u00b0F or less, except for that Pro-Image film supposedly designed for the tropics). Leaving color film in a car (or camera) baking in the sun can fog it pretty quickly - but I guess just shooting around the house during lockdown rules that out in this case. Color film has a lot of organic chemicals in it (dyes and such) and it is best to treat it like mayonnaise - don't let it get too warm for any length of time! Yes that was my thinking exactly, but I still want to rule every other option out before starting to blame the supplier. I stored the rolls in the fridge, as I do, and the film was supposed be good till 2021 when I got it. I do leave film in the camera however, sometimes for up to a week, @adan do you think this can cause such an issue? I also take a roll or two out of the fridge and keep them in my bag as spares at all times. Perhaps that's not advisable as well - I just wasn't sure if it's ok to load shoot film straight from the fridge. Also, I enjoyed the mayonnaise analogy In any case, I am now replacing the chemistry and getting a new more precise digital thermometer to at least try and eliminate these two parameters. P.S. I will attach an example of what I was able to pull out of the bad negative with a multi-exposure scan that took ages, vs the well-developed negative (both by me in the same chemistry) --img--  Edited July 9, 2020 by Dmitry Belyakov", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/311190-tetanal-ultramax-what-happened/?tab=comments#comment-4006237", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "311190-tetanal-ultramax-what-happened", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i'm leaning towards bad batch from a supplier because sometimes i developed two -----> rolls !!!  where one came out alright and the other didn't.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 100612, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Caolan Brady", "date": "2020-06-09 21:15:00", "content": "5 hours ago, fatihayoglu said: Yes, I always check 1lt options.

I mix my dev in 500ml batches, for every subsequent film I give +4% more time. If I mix it in 1L batches, for every subsequent film +2%. I count ISO400 films, as 1.5 film each. That is, if I develop 2 ISO400 film, I adjust my times as if I developed 3. You could count them as 2 if you want, to make your life easier and be on the safe side. But check the instructions on your kit to calculate things precisely.

Like I said, there is enough leeway in the technique so that by the time you have exhausted the kit it makes little or no difference if you have mixed low and high ISO films during processing, it is only if you have predominately processed high ISO films (or push processed) that you would throw the chemicals away sooner. I think you'll get to the theoretical time to throw the chemicals away whatever the ISO is and be thinking 'these must be good enough for a few more films yet'. And they will be, but that is where the cliff edge is, it's an unknown area beyond the safe 'use by' limit in the instructions. Either way the chemicals don't suddenly fail so perhaps until you get the hang of them photograph a test chart on each film to compare the first and then last to see if any difference in colour is creeping in. Thanks Steve, so for the first few tries, I will stick to given use by charts, which is 12 rolls for ISO400 and above or 16 rolls for ISO200 and below, both at 38. At least this way if I do a mistake I can narrow it down faster and also have an understanding what an optimal result should look like should the development go smoothly. In the future, probably I can process first Portra and Ektars and towards the end continue with Gold etc. On another question, all the instructions are given for either 1lt solution or 500ml. However my tank (if you'd recall) requires 600ml solution. Do you think I can pour 600ml back to the bottle once I develop first 2 rolls, where 400ml fish solution is, mix them and then develop another couple of rolls with the same duration for the first couple rolls? If that is not clear, what I mean is (fresh unused 1lt solution); develop 2 rolls with 600ml at 03:15, pour the developer back to the bottle where 400ml fresh developer is and develop another 2 rolls with mixed developer again at 03:15?

Never sharpen when scanning, apply sharpening when processing the image.

Time in the developer doesn't necessarily increase grain, if you over develop that will increase grain, but each developer and film has their own characteristics, time vs temperature.
