When the first digital cameras with CCD sensors hit the market, most people didn't care what kind of dynamic range they had. It was just digital and the photos were really good. So what's all the chatter about these mostly theoretical numbers? And I'm talking about the amateur (hobby) area. And what M9 sensor files has to do with film? Well, I know, it is same limited dynamic range as scans of slide film. Like it or not. I'm broadcast engineer, who is involved with computer graphics and image processing since earlier nineties. Talk about dynamic range, scopes and numbers are my profession. And as professional in this area I see the difference between my M-E220 and another cameras on images taken by me.
