They replaced your sensor with a \"bad\" one back then because they were still working - with Kodak I guess - to find a solution. It was a temporary solution. When your second sensor developed the same issue you should have sent it back to have the newly developed sensor. It depends when that was, but if as you wrote, it was in 2017 then you would still have got it for free. As I have written elsewhere, I understand your frustration and I still think that Leica should have provided free replacement parts for much longer. The sensor is the heart of a digital camera and the initial design had a fault. It's not normal wear and tear as another member posted.

This is their 4th monochrome camera over the last 8 years, it is especially interesting as it is the first non-rangefinder camera with a black and white sensor. I think it\u2019s worth starting with a little history of monochrome cameras. Back in the early days of digital capture - Kodak ruled the world with cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars, In 1991 they they introduced the DCS 100 DM3 with a 1.3mp monochrome sensor; this was based on the Nikon F3 camera, and it had a separate DSU (Digital Storage Unit) which went over the photographer\u2019s shoulder (and was extremely heavy). It cost around $25,000. There is a fascinating article about it at Nikonweb (see references at the end of this article). In those days the demosaicing process was not as good as it is now, and that camera produced 2 or 3 times the definition of the normal colour version. Combined sales of the colour and monochrome version was apparently 987 cameras. In 2001 they produced a 6mp black and white sensor behemoth based on the Nikon F5. The Kodak DCS 760M. By now there was competition from Nikon with the D1 and D1x and the price was a slightly more manageable $8000. There is a very good write up of this camera by Pete Myers on Luminous Landscape . Sadly Kodak completely failed to capitalise on their head start in digital imaging, and especially the concept of a monochrome camera. Despite producing the first full frame dSLR in 2002, by 2005 they were out of the professional camera market altogether, the last camera being the DCS Pro SLR/n in 2004 (I had one, it was a fine camera, if a little quirky! But they never shipped the monochrome version). Leica had great success with their M8 and then full frame M9 digital cameras and the idea of making a monochrome version of the M9 seemed a bold and interesting move. I had a test camera in April 2012, and was lucky enough to be at an exciting launch of the M9 Monochrom in November 2012 in Berlin. I still have and use my own M9 Monochrom, it was, and still is a great camera. The 24mp M246 Monochrom was announced on April 30th 2015. The M10-Monochrom on January 17th 2020 with a new 40mp sensor, and now, less than a year later we have the Q2 Monochrom with a 47mp sensor derived from that in the Q2 (and SL2). I only had the Q2 Mono for around 3 weeks for testing last August, Covid 19 meant that I couldn\u2019t do any trips with the camera, but I took the time to look carefully at its performance in comparison with SL2 (which has essentially the same sensor but with a Colour Filter Array). As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my responsibility is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical. I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not told what to write, and although I do show the articles to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. Why a Monochrome Camera? Technical reasons With a colour digital camera the sensor itself can only detect the intensity of light, but it has a colour filter array to allow it to create colour images. The process of converting the image to colour is called demosaicing - This calculates the colour for each pixel based on the colour filter, and the results from the surrounding pixels in groups of 4. The colour filter array reduces the amount of light reaching the pixels by around 1 stop, and the demosaicing process has an effect on the resolution because of the combining of information. With a Monochrome camera, you don\u2019t need the colour filter array, This means that each pixel gets the maximum amount of light thus improving the high ISO characteristics of the camera and the dynamic range. As there is no demosaicing process there is no loss of resolution - each pixel is represented directly in the final image. Of course, there are also downsides: Many of us have become used to converting colour files to monochrome using the channel mixer in our processing software. This, in effect, allows us to apply filters to our images after the event. With a monochrome camera, if you want a red filter, you need to put it on the lens rather than relying on your computer. Another issue is that, despite the higher dynamic range, it\u2019s more important to ensure that you don\u2019t overexpose bright areas. With a colour camera you can usually extract some detail from one of the other colour channels, with a monochrome camera, once it\u2019s blown out there is nothing to recover! This is slightly exacerbated by the higher base ISO of the sensor (usually twice that of an equivalent colour sensor). Photographic reasons Demosaicing techniques have improved over the years, and although there is an obvious improvement in resolution without a colour filter array, it\u2019s not quite as sensational as it was when the M9 Monochrome appeared in 2012. Added to which 47mp resolution should be quite enough for most uses. But having spent a lot of time with all of the Leica Monochrom cameras over the years I\u2019ve come to think that the most important reason for shooting with one is how it changes one\u2019s approach as a photographer. For me at least it makes me think much more about the structure and composition of an image. With the previous M Monochrom cameras, shooting normally with the rangefinder you did still see the subject in colour, the Q2 Mono takes this a step further in that you see the motif in black and white through the viewfinder. You start to think in black and white! Body and Design Leica\u2019s design department have gone from strength to strength making increasingly beautiful and functional cameras, the Q2 Monochrom is no exception, and with its grey and white markings it is indeed handsome. From a functional and operational point of view, with the exception of the obvious lack of White Balance controls, the grey lettering and the changed ISO values, the Monochrom is identical to the standard Q2. The Lens The lens is the same as the Q and Q2: If it isn\u2019t broke - don\u2019t fix it! It\u2019s a wonderful lens, compact and very sharp, it does soften up a bit at the corners, especially at wide aperture, but most of the frame is pin sharp right from f1.7. A simple twist of the lens engages Macro Mode and changes the distance gauge in the most delightful way. Close focus is 30cm in normal and 17cm in Macro mode. Controls The aperture ring is on the lens with the shutter speed on the top plate (just like the Leica M cameras). This makes the camera seem very familiar, Both the Aperture and shutter speed dials have an A position. A on both = Program Mode A on shutter dial = Aperture Priority A on Aperture dial = Shutter Priority A on neither = Manual exposure 3 function buttons can be assigned as needed, and the now familiar Leica rear buttons with Play, Function and Menu are all present. Personally, I would have liked to see a joy stick like the SL and SL2. The Digital Zoom Digital zoom is something of a dirty word in the photography world, probably from the days when small megapixel cameras offered gravelly shots at apparently extended focal length. The Q2 Monochrom is a bit different because the base resolution is so high, and because the implementation is so good, and so consistent with the Leica rangefinder. Implementation of crop mode or digital zoom in other cameras usually involves the EVF / LCD zooming in, with the Q2 Mono, as with the Q2, you can change between 4 focal lengths using the zoom / Lock-button. Choosing a longer focal length simply puts framelines in the display showing what you are going to get. If you shoot JPG files then that is exactly what you do get. If you shoot DNG then the image is not actually cropped. However, if you use Lightroom or Lightroom Classic, then the DNG file appears in cropped form (you can use the crop tool to change or remove the cropping in post processing). The four digital zoom modes are: 28mm 8368 x 5584 47mp . effective aperture f1.7 35mm 6704 x 4472 30mp . effective aperture f2 50mm 4688 x 3128 14.6mp effective aperture f2.8 75mm 3136 x 2096 6.6mp . effective aperture f4.6 \u201cEffective aperture\u201d refers to the depth of field effect\u201d I think this is a great feature, and with the increased resolution of the Q2 Mono it makes the 50mm crop zone perfectly usable and the 75mm okay at a pinch (especially as the lens is so sharp). Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually turn the lens into a different focal length, but the aspect ratio of the resulting image is exactly the same. What you lose is the depth of field relating to the cropped focal length. Basically this will always be the same as that of a 28mm f1.7, so it\u2019s harder to use bokeh to isolate the subject. Due to the big demand for review cameras I don\u2019t have a camera in front of me, but if you want more details then please refer to my original review of the colour Q2. Image comparisons During the test period I didn\u2019t have either an M10 Monochrom, or a Q2, both of which would have made interesting resolution comparisons. However, my old friend and partner in crime Sean Reid is doing a very detailed comparison of these three cameras. More about that later. I thought it was interesting to compare the Q2 Monochrom to three of Leica\u2019s recent high resolution colour cameras, the M10, the M10-R and the SL. Of course the lens used is an issue in that one can\u2019t do a real oranges and oranges comparison. In this case I\u2019ve used the 28 Summilux Asph M for the M10 and M10-r and the SL 24-90 at 28mm on the SL2. Images were all shot as DNG and the colour images were converted to black and white in Adobe Lightroom. For all these tests the camera was set on a sturdy tripod with a 2 second shutter delay. To try and limit focus variances shots were all taken at f5.6. The shutter speed was allowed to vary to ensure that the images were as consistently exposed as possible. Here is a full example of the test scene: --img--  Resolution Of course I\u2019ve shot hundreds of images, but in terms of the resolution I thought it was more sensible to do a resolution test at 200 ISO. I\u2019ve used the centre of the frame (roughly) for the comparison. The M10 and M10-R Images have been upsized in photoshop so that it they are the same size as those from the other two cameras. --img--  In addition to this resolution comparison I did a series of shots of a hedge at about 10 metres at different apertures. Sadly there was some movement in the hedge, and on some of the shots there are obvious signs of blurring. I no longer have the Q2 Mono, so I can\u2019t redo them, but although most of each frame is very sharp, it isn\u2019t all perfect and I think that posting examples might be misleading, added to which they are very boring! However what I found was that the Q2 Monochrome shots had an obvious advantage in the centre at all apertures, with a real magical presence to the files, at f1.7 and f2.8 the Q2 Mono was slightly softer at the corners than either the SL2 or the M10-R. Stopped down a little more the corners were about even, but even at f8 the Q2 Mono still showed an obvious advantage in terms of presence and detail. High ISO Performance Base ISO on the Q2 Monochrom is 200, there is also a pull option of ISO 1oo. For this test I did comparisons at the following ISO values 200 ISO 800 ISO 1600 ISO 3200 ISO 6400 ISO 12,500 ISO 25,000 ISO 50,000 ISO 100,000 ISO (Q2 Monochrome only) I loaded the groups of 4 DNG files directly into photoshop, magnified them to 100% and then taken a screen shot and labelled it. --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  Looking at these comparisons it\u2019s very clear that the Q2 Monochrome has considerable advantage over the other 3 cameras, especially as the ISO value increases and at higher ISO values it\u2019s probably about 1.1/2 stops better. Together with the higher resolution this is obviously going to be a real advantage shooting in very low light. It\u2019s quite remarkable how much detail there is, even in the 100,000 ISO shot, even the banding is very well controlled. An impressive performance. Conclusion Sadly, because of Covid restrictions and the relatively short time I had the camera I didn\u2019t manage do any street photography, and precious little portrait photography either. Hopefully with the results of the Pfizer vaccination test yesterday we will all be on the move again before too long! The Q cameras have been a real success story for Leica and a perfect example of their talent for finding a photographic niche and making it their own. The only real competitor has been the Sony RX1R II with a 35 mm lens, but Sony have not updated this since 2016 (which, with their rapid product cycles sounds like they\u2019ve abandoned it). I have to admit to starting off feeling that in this day of 48mp resolution there wasn\u2019t really a need for a monochrome version of the Q2, but actually I have been quite captivated. The superb high ISO performance is a real bonus shooting in low light and gives one extra flexibility in normal light. The resolution might not be needed, but the look of the files is so wonderfully clean and \u2018present\u2019. I think that this camera is going to be a real hit with street and travel photographers, indeed, anyone who shoots primarily in black and white.

This is their 4th monochrome camera over the last 8 years, it is especially interesting as it is the first non-rangefinder camera with a black and white sensor. I think it\u2019s worth starting with a little history of monochrome cameras. Back in the early days of digital capture - Kodak ruled the world with cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars, In 1991 they they introduced the DCS 100 DM3 with a 1.3mp monochrome sensor; this was based on the Nikon F3 camera, and it had a separate DSU (Digital Storage Unit) which went over the photographer\u2019s shoulder (and was extremely heavy). It cost around $25,000. There is a fascinating article about it at Nikonweb (see references at the end of this article). In those days the demosaicing process was not as good as it is now, and that camera produced 2 or 3 times the definition of the normal colour version. Combined sales of the colour and monochrome version was apparently 987 cameras. In 2001 they produced a 6mp black and white sensor behemoth based on the Nikon F5. The Kodak DCS 760M. By now there was competition from Nikon with the D1 and D1x and the price was a slightly more manageable $8000. There is a very good write up of this camera by Pete Myers on Luminous Landscape . Sadly Kodak completely failed to capitalise on their head start in digital imaging, and especially the concept of a monochrome camera. Despite producing the first full frame dSLR in 2002, by 2005 they were out of the professional camera market altogether, the last camera being the DCS Pro SLR/n in 2004 (I had one, it was a fine camera, if a little quirky! But they never shipped the monochrome version). Leica had great success with their M8 and then full frame M9 digital cameras and the idea of making a monochrome version of the M9 seemed a bold and interesting move. I had a test camera in April 2012, and was lucky enough to be at an exciting launch of the M9 Monochrom in November 2012 in Berlin. I still have and use my own M9 Monochrom, it was, and still is a great camera. The 24mp M246 Monochrom was announced on April 30th 2015. The M10-Monochrom on January 17th 2020 with a new 40mp sensor, and now, less than a year later we have the Q2 Monochrom with a 47mp sensor derived from that in the Q2 (and SL2). I only had the Q2 Mono for around 3 weeks for testing last August, Covid 19 meant that I couldn\u2019t do any trips with the camera, but I took the time to look carefully at its performance in comparison with SL2 (which has essentially the same sensor but with a Colour Filter Array). As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my responsibility is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical. I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not told what to write, and although I do show the articles to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. Why a Monochrome Camera? Technical reasons With a colour digital camera the sensor itself can only detect the intensity of light, but it has a colour filter array to allow it to create colour images. The process of converting the image to colour is called demosaicing - This calculates the colour for each pixel based on the colour filter, and the results from the surrounding pixels in groups of 4. The colour filter array reduces the amount of light reaching the pixels by around 1 stop, and the demosaicing process has an effect on the resolution because of the combining of information. With a Monochrome camera, you don\u2019t need the colour filter array, This means that each pixel gets the maximum amount of light thus improving the high ISO characteristics of the camera and the dynamic range. As there is no demosaicing process there is no loss of resolution - each pixel is represented directly in the final image. Of course, there are also downsides: Many of us have become used to converting colour files to monochrome using the channel mixer in our processing software. This, in effect, allows us to apply filters to our images after the event. With a monochrome camera, if you want a red filter, you need to put it on the lens rather than relying on your computer. Another issue is that, despite the higher dynamic range, it\u2019s more important to ensure that you don\u2019t overexpose bright areas. With a colour camera you can usually extract some detail from one of the other colour channels, with a monochrome camera, once it\u2019s blown out there is nothing to recover! This is slightly exacerbated by the higher base ISO of the sensor (usually twice that of an equivalent colour sensor). Photographic reasons Demosaicing techniques have improved over the years, and although there is an obvious improvement in resolution without a colour filter array, it\u2019s not quite as sensational as it was when the M9 Monochrome appeared in 2012. Added to which 47mp resolution should be quite enough for most uses. But having spent a lot of time with all of the Leica Monochrom cameras over the years I\u2019ve come to think that the most important reason for shooting with one is how it changes one\u2019s approach as a photographer. For me at least it makes me think much more about the structure and composition of an image.

In this case the Kodak TRI-X 5 ++. But isn't it a kind of cheating? The very nature of .dng files is that you make choices when you get in front of the PC, and film profiles are often a great starting point when it comes to post processing. They are only what you could do using Levels and Curves anyway and if you find one that works why do all the extra work. It's also good if you have an image and you're not quite sure what to do with to go through the profiles and see if they give you any ideas, it's only what a film photographer would do in trying different contrasts of paper before making a choice. Remove the grain or keep it, that is the question. Overt grain isn't a prerequisite of film, some photographers would choose grainy films and other very fine grain. What grain can do is change the emotional response to an image, it also gives the eye something to latch onto in broad areas of otherwise empty space. I guess most photographers didn't buy a digital camera to have grain so removing it is the popular option, but as a creative option it's still valid.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/314272-how-to-get-skin-tone-like-classical-bw-film/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-4067098", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "314272-how-to-get-skin-tone-like-classical-bw-film", "result": false, "Selector": "[ideas, making]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "it's also good if you have an image and you're not quite sure what to do with to go through the profiles and see if they give you any ideas, it's only what a -----> film !!!  photographer would do in trying different contrasts of paper before making a choice.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 110317, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Loomis77", "date": "2020-12-23 19:58:00", "content": " Hello there!
