Mike Mike, I don't think, somebody let the intern design the Leica variant of TTL flashes or the cameras circuitry, to communicate. We are talking about Metz, a company, which does flash for quite a time and Leica, a renowned lens, camera and fashion maker, not Sony. The way, I see the lack in the Leica flashes, compared to Canon and Nikon products is just this: flash is an afterthought in development for the Leica M. Not the majority of Leica M users uses flash, if TTL flash at all. Flash has no priority. For Canon and Nikon, flash is essential. The pro cameras, which are sold to big extends to professional users as journalists, sports shooters and alike need the best performance out of strobes - there is a strong market need AND A RACE between the two companies, to improve their already market leading performance. Why should Leica pair with Metz and compete with the performance of Canon and Nikon with flash? It is not Leica's main market. That time was in the 50's. And even back then, the M was not the big rig, to shoot with bulbs (it could be done, and some did), but it's reason of being was small size, but excellent quality on the negative paired with simple operation. The people, who might want to use TTL flash opposed to manual or Auto flash want a quick shot, be it out of convenience or out of quick changing lighting conditions. It is like it is and the SF58 is the best solution, if one needs TTL on a Leica (the only others being a set of Metz items or the SF24D). I use Nikon and love the simple fully automated and spot on Nikon metering and TTL flash, when I want it (again: convenience for me) or the excellent ergonomics, when needed in manual modes (product shots). I bought the SF58, to expand the poor low light performance of the M8.2 sensor, to use lower ISO in very dark scenes. It does the job - sort of (still learning/ fighting).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/99414-reidreview-review-of-leica-sf58-flash-unit/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-1579602", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "99414-reidreview-review-of-leica-sf58-flash-unit", "result": true, "Selector": "came up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "\u2026 maybe the designers did not make it a priority to make a short gap because they were designers, not photographers. only a photographer would know how a perceptible pre-flash would ruin a shot. let's face it, some genius designer -----> came !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  the utterly worthless red eye reduction! so here's my conclusion. if you need to shoot people photos with the m9 and flash on the camera and don't want to have them blinking, don't use ttl with the m9. other techniques (off camera) and methods (auto mode) seem to work better. i'm just trying to put this out there so that when the next person finds this thread while trying to decide whether to buy this flash, and what it is capable of will have the information. i am not a guy who spends a lot of time reading or posting on forums, i just go when i need information. the ttl is not working for me. whether it works for you depends on your expectations and the way you work. mike mike, i don't think, somebody let the intern design the leica variant of ttl flashes or the cameras circuitry, to communicate. we are talking about metz, a company, which does flash for quite a time and leica, a renowned lens, camera and fashion maker, not sony. the way, i see the lack in the leica flashes, compared to canon and nikon products is just this: flash is an afterthought in development for the leica m. not the majority of leica m users uses flash, if ttl flash at all. flash has no priority. for canon and nikon, flash is essential. the pro cameras, which are sold to big extends to professional users as journalists, sports shooters and alike need the best performance out of strobes - there is a strong market need and a race between the two companies, to improve their already market leading performance. why should leica pair with metz and compete with the performance of canon and nikon with flash? it is not leica's main market. that time was in the 50's. and even back then, the m was not the big rig, to shoot with bulbs (it could be done, and some did), but it's reason of being was small size, but excellent quality on the negative paired with simple operation. the people, who might want to use ttl flash opposed to manual or auto flash want a quick shot, be it out of convenience or out of quick changing lighting conditions. it is like it is and the sf58 is the best solution, if one needs ttl on a leica (the only others being a set of metz items or the sf24d). i use nikon and love the simple fully automated and spot on nikon metering and ttl flash, when i want it (again: convenience for me) or the excellent ergonomics, when needed in manual modes (product shots). i bought the sf58, to expand the poor low light performance of the m8.2 sensor, to use lower iso in very dark scenes. it does the job - sort of (still learning/ fighting).", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 37785, "year": "2011"}, {"autor": "Guest Ming Rider", "date": "2011-09-19 22:19:00", "content": "Put your dot in a glass with acetone.

Here is the standard factory engraving used on M3s (courtesy of http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/Leica/index.htm): --img--  In this case, the camera was personalized for Alfred Eisenstaedt. However, the engraving was done the same way for employee cameras and the format was used by Leica up through the M6. I have not seen a standardized format for the M7 or MP, as the regular A la Carte options put the engraving elsewhere. So, my dilemma was whether to stick with the M3-style engraving on the back, or come up with a new format to fit the newer style camera. I chose the latter, as the contemporary MP is not typically engraved like the M3, which includes \"WETZLAR, GERMANY\" on the top of the top plate. Newer models without the classic M3-style engraving on top have always had \"MADE IN GERMANY\" or \"GERMANY\" engraved on the back. Also, the engraved text on the backs of newer Ms is typically aligned against the bottom of the top plate, as opposed to being vertically centered. So, since my MP only says \"LEICA\" on top, I felt it more \"regular\" to go with my modified setup. One thing is for sure: I really can't stand the inclusion of \"LEICA CAMERA\" on the back.

Wedding Photography Sydney Ben Newnam - Wedding Photographers Sydney North Shore See if you think the Leica system will suit my style. Always open to constructive critisism. Cheers, Ben Ben, from what I see of your photographs on your site, you will surely love the Leica system! My guess is,that your biggest issues will come up with framing wide angle lenses. It takes a little time, to learn at which approximate distances your framing is where. Manual focus will come natural pretty quickly and the portraiture sure will net great results. (Here your biggest issues might come at first, to get used, to focus manually open apertures without your subject getting tired of your camera ;-) ). If you work flash, make sure, to be firm with manual or auto flash settings and off camera work - this will save you some money, instead of springing for a set of ultra expensive Leica branded strobes - just use your old flash system with radio controllers or compatible cords. Don't retire your Canon yet, if possible - there might be something, you want to keep it for - didn't see anything, the Leica M could not do in the shots on your site.

Like you said, won't be retiring the Nikon anytime soon especially for wedding work. I wouldn't go 100% Leica until I knew it inside out like I do my Nikon. Besides I do shoot a hell of a lot at 200mm at f2 and from what I have read any length past 90mm on a Leica is extremely hard to nail focus. I do love the thought of the 75mm Cron though with a closer focusing than my Nikon 85mm 1.4. Not that the Nikon 85mm 1.4 is renowned for close focusing. I know the 75mm Cron is very close to the 50mm Lux in terms of focal length but I feel I could use them in totally different ways.
