But in the last 6 months or so, I've quite fallen in love with the little bugger. I find I'm better at composing if I think in monochrome, rather than deciding to convert to B&W later. So I use the M10-D as a quasi-M10M by setting the camera to B&W JPEG+RAW mode, which makes the Visoflex display the image in monochrome! It turns it into a decent little B&W previewer. (I filter out the JPEGs before importing into Lightroom.) I've learned to work around the relative slow turn-on of the EVF by half-pressing the shutter when I start to frame the image; by the time I've framed and focused through the rangefinder, the EVF has 'booted up' and I can quickly and accurately shift my eye up to the EVF to verify the framing and whether it's going to work in B&W at all. BTW, I rarely use the Visoflex for focusing. Focus peaking just doesn't work for me; it ain't how my brain works. I prefer the rangefinder, which seems much more accurate. Having proclaimed my love for the Visoflex, there are certainly a few things I'd like to be improved: Make the diopter knob smaller and inset into the body, so I'm not constantly shifting the setting. I'm about to the point where I'm gonna tape down the knob... Toggle between B&W/color mode easily via one of the function buttons, without having to go into Fotos/menus to set the JPEG+RAW mode. Allow the GPS to be turned off completely (fine with me if done in the Fotos app, like the other settings on the M10-D). Maybe this would save enough battery that the EVF can turn on faster through some kind of standby mode. Optionally show the frame number instead of the shots remaining, in case I want to write down notes about a particular shot, and want to cross-reference after I import the files into Lightroom. Improve the physical coupling between the Visoflex and the camera (or at least add some adhesive tape) so the little guy doesn't keep sliding off the mount. Allow tilting to work only after sliding some sort of latch or key. I love the tilt, but it clicks out of position too easily, and I'm afraid the little plastic nub that locks it down is wearing out. Round off the way-too-pokey rear corners, so they don't keep jabbing me as I hold the camera. Don't hide the shutter dial as much.

I'm really happy with my A7Riv although naturally it's had very little / no use since I wandered into a Leica store and picked up an M But it is really impressive.
