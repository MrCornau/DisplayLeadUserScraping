More resolution is an advantage, but I think it has diminishing returns, and other problems can create a sweet spot. I am not basing this perspective on an internet myth either. I was influenced by this article: http://www.clarkvision.com/articles/digital.sensor.performance.summary/ It is a bit old at this point, but I still think it makes good points. New technology can help in many respects and increase dynamic range, reduce noise and improve colour, but all these new advances don't necessarily mean that you increase resolution without penalties that overwhelm the diminishing returns. A technology like BSI, which I think is a nice advance, could easily improve performance at 24 MP, 36 MP, 42MP, 70 MP, and 140MP and increase the performance equally at each resolution. The sweet spot could still be at 36 MP, but the sensor with 36 MP and BSI would be better than the sensor with 36 MP and no BSI. It could also be true that a 36 MP BSI sensor would have a bit better dynamic range and colour than a 42MP BSI sensor. Keep in mind the 42MP BSI is just a tiny bit over the proposed sweet spot for FF 35mm, and at least one reason that Sony picked 42MP was for it facility for video and shooting Super 35 format. I have the a7rII and it is a great sensor. I too hope that Leica will bring newer technology including BSI and lower base ISO to their cameras. Another new technology is the Aptina coversion that improves high ISO in the A7rII (if you haven't notice the A7rII at 640 ISO is about as clean as at 200 ISO and this advantage continues at higher ISOs, because of this new technology).

Maybe I'm missing something, but I wasn't aware that the excellent new Sony sensors had come anywhere near solving those problems (even with the Kolari mods) It's quite simple: Sony bodies are designed with thicker filter stack in front of the sensor. Sony is something like 1.6 mm, while Leica bodies are designed with something like 0.5mmm (M8) to 0.9mm (M 240). And when you introduce unnecessary objects in the optical pathway the performance naturally suffers. In addition Leica micro lenses are configured differently than the Sony ones. Anyway, this is not the point. This has nothing to do with this performance of the Sony sensor, it is truly exceptional sensor. I consider it a better sensor than the Leica one, yes.

Roy P : This would be my open letter to Andreas Kaufman: 1. Stop pretending Sony is a competitor. You have a 0.5% market share in photography, compared to Sony, which has some 20+% market share, and is a supplier of image sensors to camera makers ranging from Apple (iPhone, iPad) to PhaseOne (100MP). The list includes Nikon, Pentax and Hasselblad. 2. Visit Sony, get an audience with Hirai san (CEO), if possible, and work out a sourcing deal for Sony\u2019s flagship 35mm FF sensors, as they become available. Remember to bring a pair of knee pads to the meeting. 3. To the RF purists, offer M cameras with the RF. But for those who don\u2019t care for it, see if you can use the same space used by the RF to install a fast, high res EVF. 4. Upgrade other parts of the camera, like a retina-grade LCD back, scratch-resistant gorilla glass cover, a few customizable buttons (not the idiotic S / SL interface), fast processor, 5-axis image stabilization, pixel shifting, weather proofing, etc. 5. Shut down all other R&D, anything not related to the M system. Sell the S lens designs and technologies to either Hasselblad or Pentax. Get rid of the silly SL line before you are laughed out of the market, after sinking a lot more money into it. 6. Offer the M in at multiple resolutions (24, 36, 42, 50+ MP) with different prices, by essentially continuing to sell older models at lower prices. Offer other M variations (monochrome, limited editions, psychedelic colors, pearl capped shutter release buttons, etc. for the luxury end of the market). 7. Build up the M lens line, which has been stagnant for years now. Perhaps a 75 or 85mm Summilux, a 135mm f/2, a couple of ultra wide angles, a 16mm fisheye, a 100mm macro, maybe a 70-200mm f/4 zoom, and a few more compact f/2.8 and f/4 lenses. 8. Continue to make your specialty lenses for niche markets (cine, Micro 4/3, Leicasonic cameras) as your only non-M business. 9. Get some serious help in improving production quality and reliability of your gear, so things don\u2019t fall apart after a couple of years of serious use. Engineer products not just for clever design and aesthetic appeal, but also for rugged performance year after year. 10. Invest some serious money into a better service infrastructure. Sell a priority service plan membership for $100 a year \u2013 I am sure a lot of customers would be willing to pay that. Above all, increase repair turnaround times from months to days. Now you have a very sharply focused (pun intended) and highly defendable boutique company, but one that you can really excel in, and stay on top of your game, and that gets your customers delighted. You are also going to be far, far more profitable.

And it would seem that Leica's engineers have come to the same conclusion. There are two simple solutions if handholding is an issue. First, as I think we all recognize it is simple enough to increase the shutter speed for the shot. It is not hard to get sharp shots with a 36mp sensor handheld if you shoot at 1/2X focal length for most people. Second, you can always downsize a bigger file to 24mp and it will have exactly the same handhold ability. For those times you can use the 36mp, like when high shutter speeds are easy or on a tripod the extra mp would help, and for those times handhold would cause an issue you can just downsize to 24mp. I see no reason at all that using a camera primarily handheld should limit the resolution. The problem with a few people (and it was mainly a tempest in a teapot among some forum participants and not a widespread issue -- the camera has sold very well and has high ratings of satisfaction) had handholding the Nikon D800 is that they simply didn't adjust to the higher mps by increasing the shutter speed. This is really a user problem and not a camera problem. Oh, and by the way the reason the Nikon D5 is 21mp is because this camera is used for things like sports Nikon wants very high frames per second and the limitation is computing power and not handhold ability. You just can't push enough data with camera's current computing power for more mp if you want to keep the fps up. That has and will change as computing power in cameras improves.

Of course they also reduce the aperture, much the same way as the central spot filter on the Thambar, which is the reason they have an f-stop rating on them, but they do not act as a diaphram.
