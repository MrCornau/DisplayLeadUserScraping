After dropping into this new forum few days ago I've forgotten to introduce myself, sorry for this. My name is Bernd, I'm living near Dusseldorf/Rhine I'm taking photographs since the age of 13. I'm now 58, next year I go into retirement. 35 years ago my first real slr was a Nikon F Photomic, fitted with a Nikkor 50/f2 and a Soligor 28/2,8. Today I know the expression Street Photography but at that time it was for me just like walking around and catching moments. After a big break I started again this spring with street/people always afraid that I have lost this 'eye'. If you like, pls. look here my old pics of a young guy which is now much older but not wiser ;- Thanks Bernd --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/481-introduction-of-myelf/?tab=comments#comment-2907", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "481-introduction-of-myelf", "result": true, "Selector": "i've forgotten to introduce", "selectorShort": "introduce", "MarkedSent": " hi to everybody out there! after dropping into this new forum few days ago -----> i !!!
