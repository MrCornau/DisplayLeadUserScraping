But in the last 6 months or so, I've quite fallen in love with the little bugger. I find I'm better at composing if I think in monochrome, rather than deciding to convert to B&W later. So I use the M10-D as a quasi-M10M by setting the camera to B&W JPEG+RAW mode, which makes the Visoflex display the image in monochrome! It turns it into a decent little B&W previewer. (I filter out the JPEGs before importing into Lightroom.) I've learned to work around the relative slow turn-on of the EVF by half-pressing the shutter when I start to frame the image; by the time I've framed and focused through the rangefinder, the EVF has 'booted up' and I can quickly and accurately shift my eye up to the EVF to verify the framing and whether it's going to work in B&W at all. BTW, I rarely use the Visoflex for focusing. Focus peaking just doesn't work for me; it ain't how my brain works. I prefer the rangefinder, which seems much more accurate. Having proclaimed my love for the Visoflex, there are certainly a few things I'd like to be improved: Make the diopter knob smaller and inset into the body, so I'm not constantly shifting the setting. I'm about to the point where I'm gonna tape down the knob... Toggle between B&W/color mode easily via one of the function buttons, without having to go into Fotos/menus to set the JPEG+RAW mode. Allow the GPS to be turned off completely (fine with me if done in the Fotos app, like the other settings on the M10-D). Maybe this would save enough battery that the EVF can turn on faster through some kind of standby mode. Optionally show the frame number instead of the shots remaining, in case I want to write down notes about a particular shot, and want to cross-reference after I import the files into Lightroom. Improve the physical coupling between the Visoflex and the camera (or at least add some adhesive tape) so the little guy doesn't keep sliding off the mount. Allow tilting to work only after sliding some sort of latch or key. I love the tilt, but it clicks out of position too easily, and I'm afraid the little plastic nub that locks it down is wearing out. Round off the way-too-pokey rear corners, so they don't keep jabbing me as I hold the camera. Don't hide the shutter dial as much.

After 30 +years with M cameras i can't even understand how you can manage to hold your cameras w/o dropping them this way. To me both my M8.2 and M240 are as slippery as soap bars and the only way to hold them comfortably is to use a thumb rest the same way as i used to hold my M3 double stroke's in the past. Might be morphology, indeed. I have longish fingers. But I typically use the Leica half case (with the grip nub on the front) and rest the right side of the camera on my curled pinkie finger. My thumb rests on the control wheel/thumb ridge. If there is another balance point, it is holding the focusing ring with my left thumb and forefinger. Very stable, and supporting the camera doesn't depend on the tightness of the grip. Having double checked today, that's apparently how I grip any camera that is a normal height (the Fuji \"Texas Leica\" is a bit tough, but my index finger is just long enough to trip the shutter). You're right - the camera is like grabbing a bar of soap. I find the M240/246 ergonomics better than film Ms precisely because it fills the hand better. Better yet with the case. Having looked at the M3 manual, the way they show someone using the camera, the sole support when the camera is in landscape mode is a three-fingered sheer grip on both sides. Which seems weird because you couldn't focus without shifting grip on both hands. Note that the user's thumb is not on the winding lever at all (unless he has monkey thumbs). The M4 manual moves to a right-hand grip with the thumb resting on the advance in some unstated position, I assume \"in.\" It also makes a quizzical reference to holding the camera against the forehead (which if you look at the picture is obviously wrong, unless \"forehead\" and \"cheek\" are being confused). By the time you get to the M6, it looks like the primary support is the left hand under the lens with the pinkie under the camera (\"what our LEICA School believes is the best way to hold the LEICA\"). This now references putting the thumb on the plastic advance tip \"in the standoff position,\" which not really the position of an M2/M3 lever at half mast. So I get the sense that there has been a bit of figuring out how to actually hold this camera.

Few post above there was discussion about adding new/future contacts to M mount to provide extended functionality to future M lenses. One of replies was the space opposite the CAM mechanism is already occupied with 6-bit reader, so impossible to do anything of such kind, too much looking into the past i say and basing all thinking round M3 functional design, in words of young Swedish Environmental activists, more bla, bla, bla. So, like any young enhusiast i had a brain wave, it is Saturday after all, call it my pro-bono engineering input to this discussion \ud83d\ude18. How about we assume future \"M+\" RF camera with new generation of M lenses with new functionalities (aperture, distance, focus) but also backward compatible with current M lenses, such camera would off course br RF camera, lets keep EVF optional for now not to upset faithful \ud83d\ude02. For current lenses to work an equivalent of CAM roller may be required, let's assume it would have position feeler or transducer fitted in future hypothetical \"M to M+\" adapter, distance information would be transmitted via electrical signal to the RF patch within the RF.

Is there a way to turn on this focus assist, so it \"stays on\"? Photographing the Ibis was as much luck as skill - if the bird remained still, I got what I wanted, but as it moved its head around, I was always fighting for focus. On the other hand, the iguanas were much better at this - once they took a position, I had more than enough time to get my shot before they moved, but I had to move very slowly to get close enough, preferably while the lizard was looking away from me. I had the feeling it was always aware of me, so I tried not to do anything it might consider threatening. The full image clearly shows how little depth of field I had.

If tabletop tripods were conceptually flawed, I suspect that the world might have found that out over generations of photography. We clearly have several folks in this thread who like and use them. You're free to prefer full tripods, but your conclusions are personal and neither generalizable nor objectively true. There have always been products for photographers who fall for gadgets or take minimalism to such extremes that it becomes impractical. And one thing leads to another in photography. People buy a camera bag that just fits a camera and two lenses with room for little else. They then realise a tripod would be a good idea, but there is nowhere on a small camera bag to sling a lightweight tripod, so they want a 'table top tripod', a useless device and a travesty.

I am amazed at the pricing on certain Leica things these days. Unfortunately, the price just keeps going higher. Thank you for complementing my \"team\", which would be me, myself and I! \ud83d\ude42 I work with the folks at Leica and dream these things up. Then I work with them to get it done and it becomes a reality. It is not an easy process. The Black paint camera took 4 years to happen, with Leica initially not being very cooperative. The Hammertone took about 2 years. The most difficult thing to get right was the Hammertone finish, of course. The MP3 was actually the easiest one of the bunch. By that time, Leica was in somewhat desperate straights and in need of a revenue generator. I took advantage of this and really pushed them on this one to get everything I wanted. This one only took about a year. As noted, the elephant ear lugs were the most difficult thing for them to do on it. We also looked at a meterless, more pure version, but I figured if people were going to use the camera they would appreciate the meter. I also got pushback on the lens. The 50/1.4 ASPH was fairly new at the time, and they didn't want to divert production for a special model. Somehow, I convinced them it would be in their best interest to do it. Now it is a \"regular\" limited edition model. For the most recent special edition for the LHSA, initially it was going to be a Monochrom MD 262, but the advent of the M10 killed it off. Se we went ahead with the 50/2 APO Retro design which was intended to be in the kit. Ironically, I was told at the beginning of that project that we could not do the Retro 50/1.4 ASPH. I laughed and said that was very interesting. They asked why I was laughing. I said, because I was the one that came up with that lens and you're telling me we can't do it. Good thing they were willing to do the 50/2 APO, otherwise it would have killed off the whole project if we had just gone with the Monochrom. So with all of these \"specials\", I pushed for something unique and different, not just engraving. Some of those things became \"normal\" for future Leica products, such as the black paint finish. When I requested it, it was a lost art, and in the end they hired it out to a firm in Austria. Also, the \"Black Dot\" was my requirement for this camera too. Retro version of the 35/2 Summicron ASPH done special for the Hammertone. As noted, the special features and lens for the MP3, and now the 50/2 APO Retro lens.

I don't envy your position having to convince engineers and product managers to design something outside of their original plans, but apparently you figured it out and probably have many more tales of what it took/takes to achieve even one success against such a force of nature.

For many years, Leica chose the most-cropped picture area (the view at closest focus of 0.7m) to size the framelines. To provide a safety margin and avoid accidentally leaving out the top of someone's head, or other goofs. I.E. they optimized all their camera's 50mm framelines for framing at 0.7m. Film images tend to get additionally cropped after the fact - by slide mounts, or negative carriers, or lab printing machines. Now, with the digital cameras, which do not get cropped in viewing that way (no slide mounts, no film carriers), the frame lines optimized for 0.7m often produced very \"loose\" framing - you got quite a bit more in the picture than you expected to get from the framelines (especially in long-distance pictures like landscapes). So after trying various optimized distances since the original M8, Leica settled on optimizing the digital cameras' framelines (as in the M10) to frame correctly at 2m (a compromise between close-up and infinity subjects).

If you like 21mm for getting lots of stuff in the frame, then an EVF would be ideal: it'll let you see exactly what is in the frame. However, I've never found this goal to be useful in my own photography nor successful for others, but it is a common phase photographers get excited about. Have fun with it and follow your instincts, no matter what anyone else might say. Sidebar: The fundamental problem with wide lenses, which for me starts around 30mm, is that the corners are enlarged relative to the center. This is necessary to maintain a rectilinear view; otherwise, you've got a fisheye lens. But, in enlargement, it both distorts objects with area of interest like faces (as opposed to linear structures; again, straight lines means distorted areas and vice versa), and, secondly, wide views emphasize objects in the corner, which is rarely where the emphasized object is placed in a frame. Learn to avoid those problems and use those strengths, and ultrawide will become distinct skill. If you're excited by the leading lines created by the wide view -- the sort of tunnel effect that can point at the main subject -- then either a TTL or window finder will do fine. Basically, you compose by identifying a subject, shifting camera position to arrange lines around the subject, and shoot; the corners and edges aren't terribly important. Some people feel more comfortable with the immersive experience of a TTL finder; some people like the rapid responsiveness of a window finder (and having no electronic lag or shutter closing-opening-closing pattern). Ideally, I'd use both: optical finders offer more dynamic range while TTL finders offer more framing accuracy. Accuracy can be important because those leading lines can both draw the viewer's eye to the subject as well as out of the frame; dynamic range is important because things hide in shadows, invisible on digital displays, that are readily apparent through optical finders. My particular fascination with wide angle lenses is that it allows you to view a single, continuous surface -- or variation thereon -- which, while lit from a single source, appears to be lit from a wide variety of angles because that's the path the light takes from the subject to the lens. For this sort of image, there is no substitute for looking at the light itself: an optical finder is vastly preferred. Electronic finders, at least until they have a daylight-like dynamic range (which might happen after a few generations of self-lit pixels go by), will compress portions of the dynamic range, sometimes unpredictably but always intrusively when the dynamic range itself is your subject. There is, of course, a third option: no finder. While I have a 21mm finder and I enjoy its increased brightness and lack of clutter relative to the camera's viewfinder, I don't often use it. Shoot with any lens enough while anticipating and testing and practicing visualizing the angle of view, and you'll be able to quite accurately determine where you want to place the camera before even lifting it to your eye, and then in the viewfinder using its familiar reference points to anchor against known midfield locations.

I did love the M8 (and its jpeg monochrome rendering I could get straight out of camera), but felt a bit restricted with (a) its resolution and (b) focal length shifts with the cropped sensor, hence why I upgraded. While I've enjoyed the M240, the reasons I had for picking it were: 1) it had the evf option so I could mount and use some of my old contax/m42 lenses 2) it seemed the most cost-effective way in to the more modern tiers (high res, full frame) Leica Regarding (1) - having used the contax lenses on it for a while, I have just not been happy in use on this body - while I love their rendering, they are usually far too heavy/cumbersome, and the combination of the EVF2 was just a bit clunky for me. Thus, I have sold off the majority of those lenses to focus on Leica-M mount lenses, and I'm happy with/don't feel restricted at all with the small selection of lenses I now have for the M (elmarit 24 2.8, Voigtlander 35 1.4II, Summarit 75 2.4). Regarding (2) - the cost-effectiveness of the m240 is still true, but with the sale of the contax etc things - and not looking at new lens additions - I'm potentially in a position to jump to a different rung on the Leica ladder. Finally - I actually preferred how the M8 handled - I feel like the M240 is somewhere between some of the DSLRs I used to use and the M8; the M240 has a feel of more optionality that makes the shooting experience less pure feeling to me. This is where I'm stuck; I know that my ideal camera would be the non-existent \"M10D Monochrome\" (or whatever was the latest iteration of that). However, I also know that if (big and unlikely if, I appreciate) that camera were to release, I almost certainly would not be able to afford it. I only care to shoot B&W, and honestly the options of working in raw with a coloured image are more frustrating for me than inspiring; I guess I'm craving simplicity. When making pictures, I try to see what I shoot in B&W, and I have the camera in B&W review mode when viewing images on the camera screen (though I try to avoid doing that), but it does throw me when I review the raw ones in Lightroom and they're in colour - I would say that it almost disrupts my thought process regarding the creation of the image.

If any of you faced a similar decision, did any of you have any dilemmas like this before jumping across (or not) to the monochrome ladder, and have you found it worthwhile?

I imagine that HCB rarely focused through the rangefinder. Too much of a faff, too slow for the decisive moment, and too obvious for a photographer that fancied himself as invisible on the street. Another tip for zone-focus photography: use a fast film. Using Kodak P3200 TMax at 1000 (or 2000) ISO, or pushing TriX, will let you keep very small apertures at decent shutter speeds, raising your zone-focus hit-rate. We are lucky to have films this good and this fast. I tried this tip a few weeks ago at a local fair where I am normally too shy to approach too close to people. With Elmar 50 f/3.5 fixed at f/11 (the Elmar with its finger-nail aperture tab is not a lens for fast or inconspicuous aperture changes!), and shooting P3200 at ISO 1000, I wandered around for a good hour, guessing focus by feeling the position of the focus knob. Shutter speed was my only exposure control, and I was able to keep between 1/1000 and 1/30 at all times, from sunny to deep shade, again guesstimating all the while. I never once focused through the camera. I was fairly happy with candid street shots like these.

I am curious to know if the misalignment of the meter reading patch is always in a vertical sense or is it also possible to have lateral errors too? Thinking about your instructions I suppose the workflow in practise is to first center the dark rectangle in the framelines, and then adjust one axis of the camera position while looking at the meter needle.

Thank you. Whichever way you want to fill the frame with the dark object, like a rock, or a car against a light wall or building, etc. is OK. All of this is easier to do than it is to write. Behind the lens meters are easier than these for close-ups & the like. Altho once an MR, MR4 meter is properly adjusted, as above, in most situations, from EV2 to EV18 @ ISO 100/21, the MR & MR4 meters work pretty much the same as the behind the lens meter in an M6.

I\u2019m still learning my M3 and had a question: Should I leave the shutter cocked, un-cocked or does it even matter? In other words, after snapping a shot, should I advance the film lever and thereby cock the shutter even if that means the shutter may remain cocked for days, or longer? Hello Ace, Nice camera. The reason Leitz used a big, overbuilt, slow running shutter in an M3 was to make it more robust, more reliable & more durable. That is the same reason that they used an idea from the clock/watch industry invented hundreds of years ago which is called a \"stackfreed\" to have a more durable & long lasting spring to power the shutter. Keeping in mind that many of the mechanisms used in the manufacture of \"miniature cameras\" were copied from the clock/watch industry. As were bicycles & bicycle chains. A stackfreed mechanism allows a maker to take a spring & wind it up to a certain point & then to lock it. The spring is then wound to a second point & then locked again. The mechanism is then engaged with the spring so that the portion of the spring that is being used to power the device is in between the 2 locked positions. This way the portion of the spring's potential power that is used to power something is that \"sweet spot\" after the lowest power & before the highest power of the spring. Which is what Leitz did. So, in theory it does NOT matter if an M3 is left wound or not. It is the part of the spring's power where \"wound\" or \"not wound\" doesn't matter. The only thing that MIGHT be effected is the curtains which are rolled/extended different ways when the shutter is wound or rolled down. I have no data on the effect or not on curtains when the shutter is wound or run down.

One may see any lever model on any camera type after all these years. 2) The M2 and M3 had solid metal, sculpted \"art-deco\" levers - usually silver. A large one for the self-timer (if installed), and a smaller one for the framelines (the current MP and M-A also use the retro all-metal style). 3) With the intro of the M4, the levers were revised to reduce machining costs, and present a more modern \"industrial\" look. Both were the same size so that only one \"part\" was needed for both levers, and simplified to be a flat metal \"frame\" with a snap-in plastic insert to provide some grip and leverage. 4) at some point in the M4/M5 era, a longitudinal white line was added to the black plastic insert. This had no particular function (except decorative) on the frameline lever - but on the self-timer lever, it made the position and motion of the lever more obvious from, say, 3 meters away. One could see the black-lever-against-black-vulcanite counting down more easily with the white line acting as a \"clock hand.\" (I do not know from personal knowledge if the white line is separate white plastic, or simply white paint in a depression (like lens engravings - or 6-bit coding).) I \u2014 The inserts are also physically interchangeable between M4, M5, M4-2/P, M6, M7-era levers. NB: The Nikon F2 and Canon F-1 black self-timer levers, from the same era (1970\u00b1), had similar white lines, for the same reason. One could see what the damn lever was doing while standing in \"posing\" position several feet/meters away. 5) when the M4-2 came out, as a further-simplfied model with no self-timer, the white line no longer served a function, and was dropped for an even-simpler, cheaper all-black insert. Which remained the standard up through the M7 (the former self-timer space having been used for the battery compartment from the M6 on). 6) The plastic inserts are press-fit, and thus held under compression when snapped into the metal frame. Over time, environmental degradation (primarily UV sunlight action on the plastic) weakens the plastic, and the compression forces will eventually bow and crack the plastic across the center, and one or both halves will fall out of the metal frame. 7) If and when the inserts needed to be replaced, Leica (or other service people) mostly just grabbed two spares out of a box. Thus any particular M4 or M6 or M7 may, at this point, have M5 inserts, or M4-2 inserts, flat, domed, with or without a white line, etc. etc. Edited February 13 by adan", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317913-m4-self-timer-and-frame-selector-lever-tips/?tab=comments#comment-4140253", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "here's what i think i know about these levers and their construction. 1) all these levers are interchangeable between m leica models, so after decades of use, and wear, and breakage (or simply for the aesthetic tastes of the owner), they may have been swapped around. one may see any lever model on any camera type after all these years. 2) the m2 and m3 had solid metal, sculpted \"art-deco\" levers - usually silver. a large one for the self-timer (if installed), and a smaller one for the framelines (the current mp and m-a also use the retro all-metal style). 3) with the intro of the m4, the levers were revised to reduce machining costs, and present a more modern \"industrial\" look. both were the same size so that only one \"part\" was needed for both levers, and simplified to be a flat metal \"frame\" with a snap-in plastic insert to provide some grip and leverage. 4) at some point in the m4/m5 era, a longitudinal white line was added to the black plastic insert. this had no particular function (except decorative) on the frameline lever - but on the self-timer lever, it made the -----> position !!!  and motion of the lever more obvious from, say, 3 meters away. one could see the black-lever-against-black-vulcanite counting down more easily with the white line acting as a \"clock hand.\" (i do not know from personal knowledge if the white line is separate white plastic, or simply white paint in a depression (like lens engravings - or 6-bit coding).) i \u2014 the inserts are also physically interchangeable between m4, m5, m4-2/p, m6, m7-era levers. nb: the nikon f2 and canon f-1 black self-timer levers, from the same era (1970\u00b1), had similar white lines, for the same reason. one could see what the damn lever was doing while standing in \"posing\" position several feet/meters away. 5) when the m4-2 came out, as a further-simplfied model with no self-timer, the white line no longer served a function, and was dropped for an even-simpler, cheaper all-black insert. which remained the standard up through the m7 (the former self-timer space having been used for the battery compartment from the m6 on). 6) the plastic inserts are press-fit, and thus held under compression when snapped into the metal frame. over time, environmental degradation (primarily uv sunlight action on the plastic) weakens the plastic, and the compression forces will eventually bow and crack the plastic across the center, and one or both halves will fall out of the metal frame. 7) if and when the inserts needed to be replaced, leica (or other service people) mostly just grabbed two spares out of a box. thus any particular m4 or m6 or m7 may, at this point, have m5 inserts, or m4-2 inserts, flat, domed, with or without a white line, etc. etc. edited february 13 by adan", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 5761, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 393508, "autor": "adan", "date": 1611773580000, "content": "A couple of thoughts: 1) the M6TTL has fairly complex circuitry. At least two \"circuit boards,\" each with a number of \"chips\" or integrated circuits on them. One flexible CB wraps over the camera from the battery well on the front all the way to the ISO contacts that connect to the ISO dial on the back. Passing the shutter dial on the way, where it detects the shutter speed dial position. Another is across the top of the rangefinder, and likely contains the \"drivers\" for the viewfinder LEDs and the flash-quench (among other things). It has quite a large chip (probably a RISC processor). The top CB is why the TTL had to be 3 mm taller than the classic M6. There is a picture here of a partly-disassembled M6TTL that shows both CBs in position (the extra part on the table is - I believe - a much simpler M6 Classic CB). https://www.photo.net/discuss/threads/help-m6ttl-and-problem-with-exposure-dot-and-arrows.430897/ Of note, one can see the fine twisted black+white wires leading out of the front board to the two metering cells (one for ambient light, top, the other for flash metering, bottom) I suspect the dedicated integrated circuits are likely the hardest part to source if they fail. Once the chip factory throws away the \"blueprints,\" they have to be re-engineered from scratch. Not cheap, in a small run. Possibly more per chip than the value of a used M6TTL at this point. 2) However, I would also expect that the meter calibration is done by a variable resistor (or potentiometer, or \"pot,\" or \"trim-pot\") - a device in the circuit with a tiny knob or screwhead that can be turned back and forth with a jeweler's screwdriver to change the flow of electrons. Something that can easily be done in the factory during manufacture (and later, if needed) without needing a degree in EE. There is a \"pot\" visible on the vanilla M6 board (coppery \"doughnut\" in the center) - but that is the one driven by the shutter dial, as an analog computer (current passed is proportional to exposure time). There should be another (may look quite different) somewhere for meter calibration. Provided the CBs and the parts on them are working, the \"pot\" can be tweaked pretty easily with minor disassembly (as in the photo, pull the core of the camera out of the metal/leatherette casing).

This is my first review here so I am not used to the technicalities of posting, please forgive me if I readjust things after I post. FUNLEADER Contax G35 to Leica M Conversions --img--  I have included the 7artisans 35mm f/1.4 M and the Voigtlander VM 40mm f/1.2, the only lenses in the 35mm zone I own. --img--  Disclaimers: 1. none of the lens makers / converters have been involved in these tests and I have personally purchased all 3 lenses, none of them have been provided. 2. the FUNLEADER link above contains an affiliate link with a code that will get you a 5% discount (used to be 15%, I hope they bring that back). If you purchase using the link above FUNLEADER says I will receive 10%. 3. all opinions expressed here are my own and, just like with anything in life (especially photography equipment!), you may have a different one. A few bullet points about the tests: - done on my Leica M-P typ 240 - done on a tripod with a 2 second timer to hopefully dampen most vibrations - no filters or hoods were used and lenses were extremely clean - captured at M-P's base ISO: 200 (with the exception of a few frames captured at 1.2 and 1.4 because 1/4000 was too slow to keep equal exposures so I set the ISO to PULL 100) - exposure was manual and the exposure time was adjusted accordingly with every aperture change (generally 2/3 stop) in order to hopefully maintain an even exposure between the samples - white balance was on AUTO - all focus was EXTREMELY CAREFULLY done using LIVE VIEW at f/2 for each lens, using both the focus peaking and my own eyes to make sure I get the best possible focus - focus was redone with every lens change - the 40mm was repositioned so that the main subject filled roughly the same size in the photos (as much as possible, the infinity tests obviously show the difference in focal length) - most tests were taken all all apertures but since this ended up requiring so much work I only included up to f/8, to be honest I don't think anything past that is relevant - all samples processed in Capture 1 PRO with the default output sharpening for screen (any image processor will apply some sort of sharpening from DNG to JPG) - I am sharing a Google Drive folder with all DNGs, JPGs, comparisons and misc images, all full size. Please check them out and use them for free, a credit would be nice if you end up posting them. PART 1 / 5 A morsel of history: if you're reading this you most likely know what this lens is, otherwise this info can be easily found online. The G35/2 is supposed to be the \"lesser performer\" of the Contax G suite, the internet is funny like that, some person deemed it once as not being as stellar as the G45/2 (which is whispered to be one of the best lenses in 35mm photography history) and the internet has taken that and transformed it into \"not a good lens\" kind of rumour. I am here to prove otherwise. Here's a G35 / G45 specs comparison: --img--  This 35 together with the Hologon 16mm are the only ones I do not own in G mount. I have shot all the other ones (21/2.8, 28/2.8, 45/2, 90/2.8) on my Contax G2 and adapted on my Sony A7R3 with a cheap Ulata adapter. They are sharp, very sharp wide open. And so light. Build quality: without further ado, I think FUNLEADER and Mr. Ding have done an amazing job here: the conversion is incredible, so tiny and lovely, with a great weight and feel. The focus action is nice and smooth and the little focus tab suits the lens. The black paint version is really beautiful, I have always been a black paint / lacquer fan, hence my M-P. This version will get patina with use (unless you're Lenny Kravitz and give it a good rub to look well used). The \"gold\" version has lovely sharp black engravings and a black focus tab. The focus tabs are really nice, placed at the perfect position where, when pointed straight downwards, the lenses focus at 4 feet / 1.2 meters. I also purchased a \"gold\" helicoid as I am planning to do a conversion myself. The \"gold\" helicoid feels like brass and it's a bit of a fingerprint magnet. The helicoid has \"MR. DING\" engraved on the mount. Pretty cool. I did a bit of digging and \"Mr. Ding\" is their master craftsman, maybe having been part of MGR Production. They are also behind the Bresson Viewfinder magnifier, which I happen to have on my M-P and love. I would love to find out more about Mr. Ding, if anyone has info please do share. --img--  The weight of the helicoid is 206g / 7.26oz and the whole lens is 266g / 9.38g --img--  The lens did have a plastic ring glued on the front, on top of the original Carl Zeiss from markings, but I removed it easily and left no marks. Sorry Mr. Ding, I prefer the original Carl Zeiss engravings. The original lens hood of the G35 / G45 fits nicely, but I have the champagne version and I personally don't think it works with either the black or the gold version. I might spray paint it with a glossy enamel. Honestly, it looks amazing on the M-P. It is a gem of a little lens and a great performer. Customer service: excellent, very responsive, I had quite a few questions for them and they replied very quickly. Packing: excellent, pragmatic, not fancy. Shipping: wowsers, the lens was in my hand in Vancouver BC Canada in 6 days, dayum! PART 2 / 5: colour, focal length, sharpness close and mid distance Two notes about colour and focal length: - colour - the G35/2 renders the most accurate and neutral colours, next is the VM 40/1.2, while the 7artisans 35/1.4 M renders quite warm - focal length - the G35/2 is a little wider than the 7artisans 35/1.4 M, I wonder what their real focal lengths are. Please do share if you happen to know. Sharpness: the G35/2 is very sharp wide open, it nearly matches the VM 40/1.2 at f2, actually honestly we are splitting hairs between the G35/2 and VM 40/1.2. Keep in mind that the VM starts at 1.2, so from a lens design pov it has a lot of room to be sharp at f2. It's quite a feat how consistent the G35/2 is all the way up to the widest apertures. The G35/2 is sharper than the 7artisans 35/1.4 M at every aperture. I was surprised as well. In all honestly, I really love the 7artisans lens, it has a really nice 3d pop and the built is absolutely amazing. Check out these 100%s of this starling at f2! I used live view, there's no way to nail that in the viewfinder patch, I also took a bunch of shots and these were the best 4, maybe out of 12 or so. 100%--img--  full images for context--img--  I have done a few test sessions but not included all here (so much to process and compare), so here are a few. Before every comparison chart you will see a half size G35/2 image at f2, for no reason really other than to show you what the whole scene looked like. Session 1 close:--img--  Session 1 mid distance:--img--  Session 4 close:--img--  Session 4 mid distance:--img--  Session 5 close:--img--  Session 6 close:--img--  PART 3 / 5: sharpness at infinity Session 3 infinity (center and corner):--img--  Session 7 infinity (center and corner):--img--  PART 4 / 5: bokeh and conclusion Session 1 mid distance:--img--  Session 2 mid distance:--img--  Session 6 close:--img--  Vignetting: yea a bit, but nothing out of the ordinary at large apertures. See for yourself. Focus shift: I did not test for it, but from my walks it seems to be fine. CONCLUSION: The Carl Zeiss Contax G Planar 35mm f/2 is a gem. Coming from great heritage, it is now encased in an amazing conversion from FUNLEADER for our Leicas. The G35/2 is an honest lens, you won't find clinical sharpness here, but since you're reading this you're probably not looking for that, but for the resurrection of a highly underrated Carl Zeiss optic. The G35/2 renders the world gently with neutral colour rendition, pleasant bokeh and a sprinkle of pop. The tiny form has a great weight and feel and it simply looks incredible on a Leica. The black paint version is shiny and will brass while the \"gold\" version has lovely sharp black engravings (bit of a fingerprint magnet though). I honestly look at my camera sitting on my desk now and hear the whispers: \"take me out and make photographs\". Well done FUNLEADER and Mr. Ding, hat's off to you. Just like the original little piece of history it now protects and focuses, the FUNLEADER conversion will also be remembered as a gem amongst the connoisseurs.

part 2 / 5: colour, focal length, sharpness close and mid distance two notes about colour and focal length: - colour - the g35/2 renders the most accurate and neutral colours, next is the vm 40/1.2, while the 7artisans 35/1.4 m renders quite warm - focal length - the g35/2 is a little wider than the 7artisans 35/1.4 m, i wonder what their real focal lengths are. please do share if you happen to know. sharpness: the g35/2 is very sharp wide open, it nearly matches the vm 40/1.2 at f2, actually honestly we are splitting hairs between the g35/2 and vm 40/1.2. keep in mind that the vm starts at 1.2, so from a lens design pov it has a lot of room to be sharp at f2. it's quite a feat how consistent the g35/2 is all the way up to the widest apertures. the g35/2 is sharper than the 7artisans 35/1.4 m at every aperture. i was surprised as well. in all honestly, i really love the 7artisans lens, it has a really nice 3d pop and the built is absolutely amazing. check out these 100%s of this starling at f2! i used live view, there's no way to nail that in the viewfinder patch, i also took a bunch of shots and these were the best 4, maybe out of 12 or so. 100%--img--  full images for context--img--  i have done a few test sessions but not included all here (so much to process and compare), so here are a few. before every comparison chart you will see a half size g35/2 image at f2, for no reason really other than to show you what the whole scene looked like. session 1 close:--img--  session 1 mid distance:--img--  session 4 close:--img--  session 4 mid distance:--img--  session 5 close:--img--  session 6 close:--img--  part 3 / 5: sharpness at infinity session 3 infinity (center and corner):--img--  session 7 infinity (center and corner):--img--  part 4 / 5: bokeh and conclusion session 1 mid distance:--img--  session 2 mid distance:--img--  session 6 close:--img--  vignetting: yea a bit, but nothing out of the ordinary at large apertures. see for yourself. focus shift: i did not test for it, but from my walks it seems to be fine. conclusion: the carl zeiss contax g planar 35mm f/2 is a gem. coming from great heritage, it is now encased in an amazing conversion from funleader for our leicas. the g35/2 is an honest lens, you won't find clinical sharpness here, but since you're reading this you're probably not looking for that, but for the resurrection of a highly underrated carl zeiss optic. the g35/2 renders the world gently with neutral colour rendition, pleasant bokeh and a sprinkle of pop. the tiny form has a great weight and feel and it simply looks incredible on a leica. the black paint version is shiny and will brass while the \"gold\" version has lovely sharp black engravings (bit of a fingerprint magnet though). i honestly look at my camera sitting on my desk now and hear the whispers: \"take me out and make photographs\". well done funleader and mr. ding, hat's off to you. just like the original little piece of history it now protects and focuses, the funleader conversion will also be remembered as a gem amongst the connoisseurs. funleader contax g35 to leica m conversions i hope you enjoy the test results, please let me know if you have any thoughts, suggestions and questions. here is the google drive folder:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-mgiueiscjebkdny-gaoutlje3ftcrdy i am leaving you with a bunch of samples, enjoy. part 5 / 5 samples all the following samples are just snaps from my walks and i barely spent a minute on some of them in c1 f2--img--  f5.6--img--  f8--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f5.6--img--  f5.6--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  f4 (i think)--img--  f2--img--  f2--img--  cheers!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 12746, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 400312, "autor": "MikeMyers", "date": 1637717100000, "content": "3 hours ago, lct said: Aside from flare and native distortion if is a match for more expensive lenses to me. Here is what it can do at f/2 on digital CL. But i would not underestimate the chances of user error in adapting the lens to you camera. This said with all due respect of course . User error - yep, that would be the most likely thing. Here are a few things to consider. The Leica CL is mirrorless, so there is no need to adjust the focus system at all. On a rangefinder, the view from the small rangefinder window needs to align perfectly with the view from the viewfinder, and on my lens, on both my M10 and my M8.2 the images could not be lined up. So, I had to follow the instructions and move the \"cam\" to a position where both images lined up perfectly at infinity. If the central area in my images, at f/2, at 100% would have looked as clear and sharp as your tree trunk, I would have been satisfied. Your lens seems to be better than mine. I'm also \"pushing\" it more - your images from the Leica CL are 2048 pixels by 1363. My test photos from the M10 are 5952 x 3968. Maybe I'm being unreasonable, but having seen your photos, I would like mine (at 100%) to be just as sharp - at least towards the middle - the lens gets blurry wide open as you look further away from the center. I expected that, but I expected the middle area to be sharp. I didn't set the lens up viewing a paper target some number of inches away from me. I decided to do it at infinity, and others here have said that once it is focused at infinity, the other distances will follow. Other people in this thread have received lenses that weren't right - I read the whole thread, beginning to end, this morning. I took another series of photos, of a sunset, this evening, using f/8 and varying the exposure as the sun went down. I fully expect them to come out as nice as what my M8.2 is capable of, but not what my M10 or my D750 can achieve. I love my M8.2, and this seems to be a perfect lens for it in most ways. (.....and there still seems to be a mystery of why when I change the f/stop say from f/2 to f/2.8 (half the light) and I change the shutter speed by the same amount, one stop, the exposure looks different.

Do you feel the need of the extra 2 stops anytime the sun goes down, or in interiors? the 1.4 vs 3.5 in the M8 seems to be a big help.... The size of the summaron atracts me... FWIW, Fabian, my experience(s) and thoughts are; I didn't use the M8 with the f3.5 Summaron at high ISO. Well, not quite; I used it once at ISO 1600 and not again as the noise wasn't acceptable. As a direct result I bought two new lenses (I had owned the Summaron since '79 / '80 for use with my M2) which were the (previously mentioned) 40mm f1.4 Nokton and, to take over '35mm' duties the then-current-but-latterly-superceded 28mm f2 Voigtlander Ultron (also a great performer and, design wise, based on Leica's own 28mm f2.8 Elmarit). The 40 f1.4 gave me an extra 2 1/2 stops over the Summaron and even the smaller f2 of the 28 still gave me an extra 1 1/2 stops so the Summaron was only ever used outdoors and in good weather. In your position I could not recommend the f3.5 Summaron. It is a wonderful lens in its own way and I do still use mine but, IMO, has limited use with an M8 after dusk or indoors. In good light the Summaron is a great little lens. I treated mine to a CLA just after I bought my M8.2 and was stunned by how good was the performance. There is no distortion. With the M8 the sharpness is pretty much superb all across the frame - and it is a very sharp lens - almost from wide-open because, due to the crop-sensor of the M8, the corner-performance is not using the extremes of the lens' circle of projection so ultimate corner resolution fall-off and the inherent vignetting are simply no longer there! In your situation and using an M8 if I were looking for a fast 35mm lens to use (as, in effect, a 50mm) which is readily available for a good price then I'd go for the v2 35mm f1.4 Voigtlander Nokton. IMO - but only based on from what I've seen and read - probably the best small-sized f1.4 lens made in M-mount since the old Summilux of which it is a near copy. To get anything 'better' yet similar in size you really would have to look at getting an old, clean Summilux. If you are prepared to give up one stop then there are many more alternatives...but in your shoes I'd stick with the extra speed of the Nokton. Just my own thoughts. Philip.

(Also @01af if you want to join in here) Floating Elements (FLE) = Near focus correction in a lens by having a single lens or a group of lenses floating independently of the other lenses. Most lenses are born with poor performance at their closest focusing distance. Center sharpness may be good, but aberrations and corner softness increase when you\u2019re shooting closeups. Floating elements are lens elements outside of the primary focus group that change position when the lens is focused on a close object, correcting aberrations and improving close up performance. Floating Elements originally was coined by Canon in the 1960's and quickly became the general term for this feature. Other brands came up with new names for the same thing, Minolta called it Floating Focusing, Nikon used the term Close-Range Correction (CRC), Leica call it FLE/Floating Elements. Floating elements are for close-focus improvement of image quality and not for reducing \"focus shift\". Floating elements by themselves cannot reduce focus shift, but by reducing the impact of focus distance on performance, they give the designers more freedom in other areas - which could include minimizing focus shift. (As a side-note, when a lens \"rattle\" when moved, it is not the floating elements \"floating around\" but can be the IS (Image Stabilization) elements for elense that has that, AF elements for auto focus lenses, or the aperture cage that rattles (as in the case of the Leica 35mm Summilux-M f/1.4 FLE - if you stop down the Summilux to f/16, the sound is usually not there). --img--  Edited February 3 by Overgaard", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317411-review-leica-noctilux-50mm-f12/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-4132462", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "on 2/1/2021 at 11:22 pm, adan said: jono, jono, jono! you know better than that! a floating element is for correcting close-up performance (at any aperture) - it compensates for the differing mathematics of parallel (near effective infinity) and diverging (close-up) light rays. it has nothing to do with correcting focus shift. focus shift is caused by different bundles of light rays predominating as one stops down to different apertures and eliminates the outer ones. has nothing to do with a floating element. although a myth to that effect has grown up around the 35 summilux fle - but it is just a fan-boy myth. what leica actually says is: page one, paragraph one: http://www.summilux.net/m_system/images/summilux35asph-2010.pdf no mention of focus shift whatsoever. what fixes focus shift is taming spherical aberration by way of different glass or different curvatures (see: c/v nokton 35mm f/1.4 version ii. a new non-floating glass element, but not a floating element in sight ). i made this definition of fle that might explain it. feel free to comment on it as there may be details i didn't get right.

The mount also is not strong enough to prevent it getting wobbly - something which won't happen to other collapsible Leica lenses. It was first introduced with the M6J in the mount it originally got when it was first built with M-bayonet. I havn't used such a version, though if this built equals the quality of the original M-Version it would be much preferable. I am also not sure whether the M6J-version has a straight-line mount - the lens head not turning around when you focus it. This would be a big progress compared to the original version. So since Leica started to \"reissue\" some old lens-designs, a 50mm Elmar (preferably 1:3.5 with modern glass) with the old but straight-line mount of the bayonet-Elmar would be more appealing than what they have \"reissued\" so far.

But it is the case that the M framelines usually show a bit less than what will appear in the final picture. Especially using the film M framelines (e.g. M6ttl), and at longer distances. 1) Parallax leeway: Since rangefinders (except the live-view digitals) do not view through the lens, the optical viewfinder sees the world from a point up and to the left from what the lens actually sees. It is about a 5cm/2-inch error from the center of the lens to the center of the viewfinder. This makes it possible to accidentally cut off things at the top of the picture (i.e. people's heads). The M framelines do have some parallax correction (they move down and to the right as one focuses closer.) But they do not account for an additional error..... 2) Lens extension factor: Any lens without full internal focusing increases its distance from the image plane (film or sensor) when focused closer - in video parlance, it \"breathes\". When the lens moves away from the film/sensor, it projects a larger image. Its effective or apparent magnification increases and crops the scene even more. Anyone who has ever used any kind of projector (movie, video, slide) has seen this effect - move the projector away from the screen or wall, and the image projected gets bigger and bigger (sometimes running right off the edge of a fixed-sized screen). So a 50mm lens focused right down to 0.7 meters will \"frame\" like, perhaps, a 56mm lens. Leica corrects for THAT by sizing the framelines for the worst-case scenario - the smaller area that will be captured at the minimum close-focus distance, approximately. Except in the digital bodies, but see next point. Since the framelines do not change size (just position) when focus changes, pictures taken at long distances will show more in the final picture than the framelines indicated. 3) Film images are usually cropped even more by mechanical devices after the fact: Whether it be slide mounts, enlarger film holders, scanner film holders or minilab machines, very few are designed to show the entire image right out to the unexposed borders. So again, in sizing the camera framelines, Leica's lines crop another 1-2% or so, to avoid nasty surprises in the lab. 4) The great viewfinder change: In 1984, with the M4-P, Leica added the framelines for 28mm and 75mm to the classic M4 lines for 35/50/90/135. Squeezing in those lines required - adjustments - to the other framelines, which made them generally a bit smaller (even more cropped) to allow adequate spacing. It pays here to remember the mechanics of the frameline system - two sandwiched masks or stencils, with slits cut in them to pass the light that shows up as the bright framelines. One mask is the actual slits you see as the framelines. The other slides around, when mounting a lens or using the frame-selector lever, to hide two of the slit sets, so that you only see one pair at any one time (28/90, 35/135, 50/75). And of course the whole thing slides up-left/down-right for some parallax correction. If the slits are cut too close together, the stencils can fall apart, so Leica has to \"fudge\" the framing accuracy a bit to maintain some minimum spacing between the slits for all six focal-lengths. The net result of all those \"margins for error\" does mean the framelines will be tighter than what the lens will actually capture. The 90mm lines frame about like a \"105mm lens\" (16% error) in my film experience. The 50mm lines (set for 0.7m on film) may come close to the 75mm field of view at landscape distances (although I suspect it's more like a 60mm view). On the digital Ms, with no film-reproduction effects (3) and the ability to check the images immediately for framing errors (1,2,4), Leica has standardized all framelines to be precise at 2 meters, rather than the \"old, film\" minimum focus distance (0.7, 0.9, 1.0 or 1.5m). Better for landscapes - but may result in less in the final picture than expected, below 2m. Those who know video can think of the film-M framelines as the \"action-safe area\" at close distances and the \"title-safe area\" at longer distances.

But also consider that the corrections applied in-camera are mild to barely noticeable for most lenses with a focal length of 50mm and above and that, in any event, such corrections reflect some kind of \"compromise\" value across both aperture and focus ranges. Ideally, you'd usually want a higher level of edge/corner correction for an image taken wide open at infinity than for one taken at f/8 at close range. Yet, that doesn't quite happen on M digital cameras because, unlike other cameras, no such information is passed from the lens to the body.

For example, when I cross into or out of direct sunlight, I'm adjusting exposure. Similarly, I might read focus for subjects on the other side of the street, make a mental note of the focus position, and keep it there until I see something more specific; then I might see a crowded restaurant entrance and focus on that, then slowly pull focus as I approach, then revert to the across-the-street distance after passing by. I do prefer tabs, though. When I'm shooting regularly -- not the past 18 months -- I find the lens is sometimes focused without any conscious action on my part before the viewfinder reaches my eye. Because I normally shoot tabbed lenses wider than 50, I'd strongly prefer a tabbed 50; fortunately, this group includes some splendid options, such as the Summilux Asph and Summarit 2.4 or 2.5. If I had a non-tabbed Summicron, I'd most likely buy or make something like that \"taab\" thingajiggy. But 50 and longer definitely require more precision than a 35, and a knurled ring gripped with fingertips is about the most precise human-machine interface, so there's good reason that tabs aren't ubiquitous. (For precision, I grip the tab between thumb and forefinger.) For precision while shooting street, well, (a) feel free to try but don't expect much and (b) continuously watch for good targets to focus on because chances are your subject won't be an ideal focusing pattern ... and because good focus targets have high contrast edges, which in turn are great for image composition.

I'm planning to sit on a grand jury for a month so I've wound down most of my projects and my stir-craziness is manifesting in writing about photography and associated gear.] If the Fuji meets your needs -- your methods and priorities -- keep using it. Better photographers make better photos, and using the same gear consistently and repeatedly allows the technical stuff to become automatic so that you can focus on becoming a better photographer. Fuji makes some splendid tools; they won't hold you back unless you're trying to do something they're not good at, and they're good at a very wide range of things. For instance, I set my Fuji to manual focus but use a focus-lock button to trigger an AF cycle instead of twisting the focus ring. Conversely, Leica M is good at a very narrow range of things. Within that range, they're amazing; even borderline near the edge of that range, though, they can be quite maddening. The way I prefer to shoot is squarely centered within the M wheelhouse. I think of it like a well-trained but energetic dog: mention a command and the job is done before you know it, but say nothing and you'll start finding bits of your stuff shredded and ripped. To my mind, chimping is antithetical to street shooting. Reviewing means looking at what's already happened, which breaks the flow/mindfulness I need to shoot productively. Chimping can also be a safety issue for me because I wander into traffic.* If I get something wrong, then I got it wrong, no big deal; but if I investigate whether I got something wrong or whether I could have done it better, then I'm in an analytical/editorial headspace, not the perceptive/creative mindset that I cultivate. Actually, if I get something wrong, that's wonderful. Mistakes are fantastic because they give me a clear, distinct opportunity to learn. If I make the same mistake multiple times in an outing, so much the better. Then, in the leisure of my home or hotel, I can study the mistake, find a tentative solution; then I can practice that method, and if it works, develop it into a habit so that I unconsciously avoid that problem in the future. Mistakes are beautiful things. Make them. Make them hard enough that you'll learn from them, make them fast enough that you'll move on quickly. Don't try to avoid them. Instead, figure out what you want, figure out how to achieve that, then set it up so that'll happen when you next press the shutter. I don't want an M-D, though. Having the opportunity to chimp is amazing. Tricky exposure can be nailed down very quickly with a histogram...but that's not image review, that's anticipating what sort of light I'll want to capture in the present environment. On the other hand, when I know something's off, I can stop shooting and practice and learn in that exact environment. Then, auto-review on every shot provides instant feedback: did I use that technique successfully? But I'm honest with myself: at that time, I'm no longer a photographer but a student; I ignore opportunities but seek practice drills. Otherwise... well, if you absolutely, positively must get this shot, then bracketing and bursting is far faster and more reliable than chimping, considering, modifying, and re-shooting. Chimping is like working in a minimalist studio, and that sort of shooting really benefits from working in a real studio, tethered to a computer with the photo processing tools that you'll be using later on. Actually, if I shot portraits, I'd chimp a ton -- not to look at the photos but as a bit of theater to make the sitter relax while I fiddle with my gear until we get to the \"real\" shots, which I'd be taking all the while, but that's not really chimping, only acting.

I love the way you took a lot of thoughts buzzing around my head, and put them into words that anyone can understand. Thank you!! The tab - I think that's why I preferred using the 35 instead of the 50, and once I get used to the \"position\" of the tab, and a distance, I'll be all set. As it was, I looked at the distance scale, and picked something that seemed appropriate. It should have been (but wasn't) obvious that once I learn this, I can set the focus just by moving the tab to an appropriate place. Fuji and Leica, for me, so similar, but I use them very differently. The Leica is always a challenge for me. The Fuji already knows what it wants to do, so most of what I deal with is composition. I'm proud of what I get from my Leica because I had to \"do\" everything, but the Fuji leaves me free to concentrate on what's most important. That article I linked to about the Fuji is something I found very interesting, and it gave me some insights on how to better use my Leica. It's all a learning experience. The Leica and Fuji are similar, and completely different from my DSLR gear. And sticking with just the Leica and Fuji, the Fuji \"cheats\" in ways that work out beautifully. I'll post just one image below from today's session with the Fuji. Not only did the Fuji automatically focus on a \"right eye\", it automatically fired the flash just enough to make the girl's skin tones better. Had I shot this with my Leica, knowing what I know now, and with no extra equipment, I doubt this photo would have come out so nice. All I had to worry about was timing and composition.

Is this the russian reverse logic?... No. This practice dates back to an era before automatic-aperture-indexed TTL metering with cameras which utilised 'Stopped-down' metering. In the older system of TTL metering the aperture had to be closed - physically - for the TTL meter to give an accurate reading but, obviously, if the required aperture was, say, f22, it would be nigh-on impossible to focus the camera because (1) the v/f image would be too dark and (2) the depth-of-field would make accurate focussing difficult. So what happened was that metering was calculated by stopping-down the aperture at which point both the aperture-indicator-ring and diaphragm-rings were set to the correct position - say f8. The diaphragm-ring ONLY was then opened back up to max. aperture for focussing. Once focussed the ring was then turned, in a fraction of a second if need be - as far as it could go (in this case f8) to the pre-set aperture-mark. The aperture-ring, once set, acted as a back-stop beyond which point the diaphragm-ring could not travel and so the correct exposure had been achieved. Not elegantly explained as I cannot for the moment remember all the correct terminology from that far, distant age - so apologies! - but hopefully it makes some sort-of sense? Philip. EDIT : To try to put things in a visual context and one which members might be at least slightly familiar; think of a Nikon F with (say) an FTn metering prism. The 'full aperture indexing' lenses used by Nikon at this time had the 'Claw' screwed on to the top-rear of the lens barrel and the index-link-pin of the metering prism dropped into a central gap in this claw. Once the lens' maximum aperture was 'indexed' to the meter (by rotating the aperture-ring fully counter-clockwise then fully clockwise) the meter could then tell, solely by the position of the pin, at what aperture the lens was going to be used even although the diaphragm remained wide-open. This practise became known as 'Open-aperture Metering'. Progress!

Last week I got a SF60, I purchased it only because I found it for a very good deal, and because TTL is useful, but it feels like a toy compared to a Godox V1. I agree with you that Leica has a rather weak 3rd party flash maker support mainly due to the low volume of Leica cameras in the market.

I keep both Sigma zooms for now since the 24 end is handy at kids events. 28-70 is better for hikes. The 16-35 is amazing for landscapes and the APOs are awesome of course when you shoot out of a bag that's traveling in a car. But the 90/2.0 was such a puff of fresh air that I'm seriously interested in getting a smaller kit and seeing where it'll go. IMHO, a possible mistake on Leica part was to treat SL as an evolution of S, with the same audience as S -- studio photogs. The original 4-button design was S, the on/off switch too (without CS position of course), the top wheel etc, all a shrunk S. The heavy APO primes were slightly shrunk and standardized S primes. There weren't any compact primes. If Leica'd put out smaller primes, we'd see a completely different character of a system, like street Nikon. And many would love it.

I'm not here to talk about which camera's got the best AF and I rightly say that the crown belongs to other maker than Leica. The disagreement here is about possible vs impossible to get 'sharp' pics in BIF from SL series cameras. There is two different things about continuous AF that we are talking about regarding 'sharp' pics. First is the ability to lock focus on BIF and the other is the 'sharpness' of the image on the required spot of the bird (I would say the eye of the bird). Some forum members just regard Leica AFC as useless and I would attribute the problem to 'unable to lock focus'. In your note above, you refer to the second case of 'sharpness' at the required spot.

The SL2 AF position is freezed in the last focus position and whatever you do in front of the camera: NOTHING. The AF is \u201eout\u201c and the camera acts as in \u201estandby\u201c mode - but still perfectly delivers the HDMI out. Once you tap on the back of the screen and \u201eactives\u201c it again, the AF is back to live and starts tracking again. So now my question: What I am doing wrong here? I believed that Red Dot Forum is using SL2 in their Live YouTube Broadcast and it looked to me that AF is working for them? Anyone has some magic trick in your sleeves, any settings I am missing on the video side to have AF continuously working? Of course I am aware that with full manual focus the whole issue would not exist, but this is not \u201edoable\u201c in my scenario, since the \u201etalking head\u201c will move a couple of times during that session and the camera SL2 is not in \u201ereach\u201c to manually correct/ adjust the focus - hence I definitely need and want to use AF at some sort. In \u201enormal\u201c Videomode i also do like the smooth AF shifting of the Leica SL-Series and it is not so bad IMHO. And to be clear, if AF in general is available - why should I not be able to use it? Of course I get the point that the technical AF implementation could not be on pair with Sony/ Canon (Eye-Detect AF), but it should be at least \u201ekind of good enough\u201c and work in \u201egeneral\u201c. Thanks so much in advance!

Sony and Fuji happen to be enormous imaging and technology companies, so when they pull out the stops, some very impressive things come out. Leica has a slightly different position in the market as the \"premium\" seller, but like all premium sellers, they have to give users a premium experience while also maintaining enough credibility that their product justifies the price tag. So the pressure is on Leica as well...hopefully over the coming years they will rise to the challenge. I will say, however, that the SL2 is one of the nicest cameras I have ever used. I see the X100S as more threatening to the S system than the SL. The SL is more a 35mm do it all camera.

Many long term Leica users are very happy with their SL2\u2019s having perhaps bought into the SL line via the M, Q or CL lines. Quite often they\u2019re using a mix of M and SL glass without any particularly demanding AF requirements. If this is the case I can quite understand why people push back on the need for updates to enhance x & y because for them \u2018why\u2019? However, as someone with 4 Leica camera\u2019s and an assortment of SL and M lenses, I\u2019m concerned that Leica have been somewhat caught out with the SL2 by the competition which could lead it to being a dead end and needing an SL3 replacement fairly soon. Back in late 2019 many systems were a compromise and it depended on what features mattered least to you as a photographer. For example an A9 was superb for AF but suffered from poor menu\u2019s, an EVF of dubious quality and suspect weather sealing. The Fuji MF camera\u2019s where either twice the price of the SL2 or still had 50mb with AF that was poor in comparison. So the SL2 launches (I bought one in December 2019) with all the superb Leica attributes from colour science - to build - to a market leading EVF. I purchased some SL glass and could use my M lenses, I appreciated it didn\u2019t have market leading AF but hey I really didn\u2019t need extreme action performance. Spring forward to today and the market has changed dramatically as now Sony, Canon, Fuji MF and Nikon have all introduced camera\u2019s only one year on that have around 50mb+, have market leading to superb EVF\u2019s, far better menus than their systems in 2020 and the build has improved significantly as well. They\u2019re all roughly priced at the same point as the SL2 now as well. It rather reminds me of the Fuji XH1 which went from being an \u00a31,800 top of the line APSC camera at launch to something like \u00a3800 within 18 months as the competition (and the XT3 shot past it), timing is all as for example the Canon 5D MkIII (I loved that camera) launched at the right time and really didn\u2019t have too much competition for sometime. So of course today the SL2 has had an update and is just as good as it was at launch in 2019 but the competition have now have the \u00a35k hybrid all rounders than have drastically closed the gap on Leica\u2019s traditional strengths. You can see it has SL2 advocates thinking \u2018maybe maybe\u2019 a GFXs gives me far more resolution for the money/my large print landscape work and decent build/AF or the R5 comes close ergonomically now but has vastly better AF and RF lenses that seem to be gaining a very good reputation. The M and now Q2 have been very successful for Leica and it\u2019s not for me to tell them how to run their business but they must surely have some question marks now as to how they can keep the SL2 competitive at this price point to sell enough or have to bring forward the SL3 (same body perhaps) with Panasonic\u2019s new S2R or S2 components. The Q2 probably completely outsells the SL range but it\u2019s unique and is very well positioned, the SL2 though has to swim with the sharks and the water is very crowded. Panasonic must be struggling to sell may S1\u2019s and S1R\u2019s at the moment but I hope the S5 does well, they to must be thinking what is the likely ROI on going with an S2 and S2R that is competitive with the new breed, this will have significant ramifications for Leica and us all over the coming years and our significant investment in the SL line.

The SL2 has excellent color and extremely good sharpness. It is one of the best sensors I have used. Regarding lenses, if it were me and I were constrained a bit by the budget, I would get 2-3 lenses from Sigma. The first would be the 35mm f2 DG DN Contemporary, as it is a very good lens at a very reasonable price, and it handles very well on the body. I have this lens and can vouch for its performance. It may not be as good as the 35mm APO Summicron, but it is very good, nonetheless. The next lens I would get would be the 65mm f2 DG DN Contemporary. It is from the same lens line, and I think 65mm, while a bit of a non-standard format, winds up being a very useful and effective focal length, especially on a high resolution body. Given the ability to crop with the SL2, you can crop fairly effectively from 35mm to 40 or 50mm, and with the 65mm you can either use it as a long standard lens, or crop in more as a short telephoto. Again, this is a very sharp lens with nice bokeh and a very reasonable price, one which operates natively on the body and has AF. If you wanted to round out the selection, the 24mm Sigma DG DN is very inexpensive and extremely good for the price. Another option would be to get a telephoto zoom, but I personally steer away from them due to their large size and weight and inferior optical performance as compared to primes of similar vintage and price. At B&H, the 35mm and 65mm together cost 1340 dollars plus tax, which is rather remarkable in comparison to the Leica equivalent, which would set you back 10,600 plus tax. I think it is fair to say that not so many people would see a 9260 dollar difference in their performance. Nevertheless, I am not saying that the Leicas are not worth paying for, only that they are only worth it for people who truly need or want the extra bump in performance at the extremes and are willing to pay very large sums to achieve it.

I think that the CL confusion arises from the existence of the Leitz-Minolta CL for the Japanese market (see Cameraquest) All CL types were built by Minolta. It is not logical that they would stop building the camera for a few years and then buy the full rights. The first CLE dates from 1981. I have no doubt that you know when you bought your camera - that was not my point. What seems to have been lost in the weeds is what happened between the end of the M5 (1975) and the end of the CL (1976), and the release of the M6 (1984, though you got yours in 1983). It seems that gap was filled by the M4-2 & M4-P. I\u2019m not sure it really matters what Minolta was up to, as we were discussing the Leica offerings. Relevance? Well, that shakey period aside, Leica has maintained the M camera system since its inception in 1954. The reflex cameras came and went, and there were a lot of compact cameras along the way; but the M system has been a constant. The L system has only been around for 7 years or so. I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about Leica\u2019s commitment to the SL line, but the TL/CL \u2026 at best, it seems to be drifting. The others in the L Mount alliance seem to be making full frame cameras and lenses, but no one else is making APS-C cameras for the L mount. That could be a unique marketing position, or a millstone. My perception is that the APS-C L mount camera was centred on the T camera. That was released prematurely (a mistake Leica was careful to avoid with the SL). They then rebadged effectively the same camera with the TL, and that didn\u2019t really seem to do the job. The TL2 finally resolved those problems, but by then it seems to have been too late. The CL was an effort to solve the TL\u2019s major problem - traditional Leica buyers didn\u2019t like the cellphone-esque haptics and body. Interestingly, a less functional, but otherwise identical camera, wrapped in traditional Leica M form had some appeal to the Leica buyers. But it was never Leica\u2019s core intention for APS-C. We\u2019ve had three versions of the T format, and one CL. I suspect there might be something else for the APS-C L mount lens owners, one day.

Interestingly, a less functional, but otherwise identical camera, wrapped in traditional Leica M form had some appeal to the Leica buyers. But it was never Leica\u2019s core intention for APS-C. We\u2019ve had three versions of the T format, and one CL. I suspect there might be something else for the APS-C L mount lens owners, one day. Or, it will quietly be dropped, and those lens owners will be told to use the SL. The competitive landscape has changed since the release of the CL, including competition coming from Leica's own SL line. Back then, the 24mp SL was priced at about $6500; the price was later reduced to $4500 or so which is where the SL2-S got priced. Quite plausibly, the economics (both in terms of the manufacturing cost and the consumers' willingness to pay for an APS-C camera in 2022) will compel Leica to avoid making a $2500 CL2 and instead go for a $3500-$4000 full frame EVF L mount body that is basically a 24mp Q body sans lens. Such a body may just make more economic sense for Leica and it ain't so bad for the Leica photographer either. The camera is FF but you decide whether you want to mount a FF or APS-C L mount lens (or an M lens via an adapter.) Such a camera serves CL clientele as well as users currently resorting to M + Visoflex. Personally I can be happy with either outcome.

I sent it back as defective and received another in exchange. It was tight too, but locked on properly with a reasonable amount of force. I'm not sure but I believe that the lens release button on the CL might have a microswitch. The microswitch closes the circuit on the sensor ring when the lens release lock is fully engaged ... So if the mount adapter is not entirely seated correctly and the lens release lock isn't quite fully engaged, the microswitch doesn't close and the six-bit code sensor is not enabled. Then a watchmaker friend suggested the barest wipe of a little graphite-molybdenum grease on the mating surface of the lens mount flange would be good. I dipped a toothpick into his supply, just the very tip, and rolled it along an arc of the mounting flange. I then wiped that tiny amount around the flange with my fingertip. The flange felt dry to the touch, but now it slides and clicks into place easily, precisely, securely, positively ... every time. I've never had any problems with the mount adapter recognizing coded lenses since. Regards the aperture display, there is no connection between the body and the lens that transfers the current aperture setting. The lens profile that is sensed simply informs the body what the maximum aperture of the lens is; the actual setting has to be calculated and in previous Leica bodies that displayed the aperture dynamically, it was often incorrect by as much as a stop or two. Enough people complained about that that Leica decided it was better to simply disable dynamic aperture display, so you either look or you count clicks to make a precise setting. It's a compromise either way. ... Happily for me, it's never bothered me since I always set the aperture I want to use before bringing the camera to my eye ... an old habit from decades of simple, manual, meterless camera use\u2014I set the shutter speed too, at the same time, and then adjust that based on the readout in a metered camera.

Still full frame is where the development money seems to go. Does not Fuji make the best small frame camera? Can anyone compete with a market leader? You asked for a contrasting experience and it seems mine may just fit the bill. I came from a big ol' chunker of a DSLR (Nikon D610) and assorted equally chunky lenses (Sigma 50mm Art, Sigma 150-600mm, Nikon 20-35mm f/2.8, you get the idea). After developing some quite severe back problems, I had to let those go and make [lack of] weight my primary concern 1. Being a big fan of lists, I literally went and did a comparison of weight (vs price) of every potential camera system at the time (the Nikon Z's and Canon R's were to be launched some months after my list began) and lo and behold, the Leica APS-C system was (and to my knowledge still is) the lightest interchangeable lens system out there 2. I initially had the CL and the Leica ultra wide and telephoto zooms. Fine lenses, both of them. A fine camera, despite the wandering focus point issue, even though I never experienced that one (sorry, @jaapv). And I sold all of that really fine kit to move towards what I'm currently shooting 3: Leica TL2 Leica M-Adapter L Leica Visoflex 020 Voigtlander VM 10mm f/5,6 Voigtlander VM 40mm f/1.2 Voigtlander VM 75mm f/1.5 And I couldn't be happier. The Cosina M lenses are excellent, light, bright and balance well on the TL2. Comparing cost, the TL2 kit was quite a bit cheaper than the CL kit. I have had no problems with the focus peaking, I enjoy the TL2's diminutive size and good ergonomics and while quirky I've come to appreciate the 020's ability to tilt and save my neck from some awkward and painful positions. But really, most of the time I actually focus on the back screen. Which seemed blasphemous to me even as recently as last year! I'll put an image where my words are and share with you an image I took as part of a concert shoot I did a couple of weeks back. Really crammed and poorly lit underground (both literally and figuratively) punk venue. Most images that night were taken - as is the one attached - with the 40mm f/1.2 using the 020 and focus peaking. 1. I was and will likely continue to be solely focused on ILCs. I am aware that something like the Q or a single all-purpose zoom lens would be eminently usable, but it's just not my thing. I guess I'm masochistic in liking to switch primes in and out. 2. I mean with a sensor size greater or equal to APS-C. I shoot exclusively in available light and a tiny m4/3 or even 1\" sensor gets all mushy when the lights dim. 3. And also because I'm really hoping the CL2 will have IBIS so I don't have to keep lusting over an SL2-S. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/318602-tl2-l-mount-broken-promise/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-4260747", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "21 hours ago, tom1234 said: i keep getting emails from this thread so finally i can not shut up my opinion... i bought a tl2 system and found it inadequate (quite a sophisticated word for the disaster i had). as an overall statement i would say that the development money goes into full frame 35mm not into smaller frames. some particulars below: menu: the menu system and customization was a great idea but not big enough to put the needed menu items where you wanted them so even after rearrangement you still didn't have the simple working system you hoped for. focus peaking: the manual focus system was flakey in that the peaky lines were 'fat' slightly overwriting the edges they represented, so you might not be sure what was and was not in focus, yet they needed to be fat on the small screen to be seen. worse\u2026 sometimes they did not come up\u2026 so you could not trust the manual focus system. size: the body was so small and light, a good thing i thought when buying it, that any big lens dwarfed it so you were holding the lens not the body. putting 35mm lenses on it using various adapters, especially zooms, resulted in an unwieldy combination so you could not hold it still to shoot pictures. unwieldy is an understatement here since the size of an adapted lens made the camera body -----> position !!!  \"jumpy\" not staying in place so you could not hold the screen still enough to see the framing or focus. people complain about the leica sl2-s size, that is holding it over a full day of shooting, but you may need the size to balance it with the new larger lenses. the smaller panasonic s5 should be contrasted here\u2026 send me an email if someone does this. conclusion: all things kind-of worked but not constantly\u2026 the body would not consistently act in a predictable manner. this was not a body i could depend on. cost me well over $1,000 usd to find all this out. and the used accessories sold for about 25% of the nearly new price i paid for them so \"the market knows\" the value. having had poor experience with leica body repairs, m9 new sensor fell loose and a zoom lens was sent back not fixed, i did not waste time sending the tl2 body in for repairs, instead i returned it to the seller. maybe one of you own it today?

Near the top of the article, you wrote: \"The CL incorporated the new Leica L-mount which was first introduced on the Leica.\" That should be \"... Leica T\". It's interesting to hear how others set up their CL for use to suit their needs, expectations, and (presumed) comfortable workflow. I use my CL body rather differently from others, I suspect, in that I do not use any TL or SL lenses on it at all. I bought the CL body-only to allow me a digital, TTL viewing/focusing camera when I sold the SL and my SL lenses. At the time, I was using my M-D typ 262 most of the time. What I didn't realize when I bought it was that the image quality and the versatility of the CL were so good, and that it was enough smaller and lighter, that I would soon sell off the M-D 262 body as well. The CL is now my default \"leicht kamera\" that I naturally grab whenever... I already had/have a full complement of both Leica M and R lenses. My camera is always set up with the Leica M Adapter L fitted and my standard 'walking about' lenses are M-mount (usually a wide, a normal, and a modest tele). When I'm doing more specific things, I switch to my R lenses using the Leica R Adapter M stacked onto the M Adapter L. This gives me access to prime lenses in focal lengths from 10mm up to 360mm, plus macro lenses in 60 and 100mm. I can alternatively stack a Nikon F->M-mount adapter for use with a 600mm reflex mirror lens too, occasionally. Using the camera this way means that I am limited to manual and aperture AE exposure modes and have no auto focusing. That works well for my photography: I've never missed the AF and have only found limited desires on rare occasion for Program and Shutter priority operation. The 'control panel' view added in fw 4.0 release does nothing for me since all the same information is available on screen anyway with the info display active and the center button on the four-way controller hides it if I so desire without needing to give a precious programmable button. I have the FN and dial buttons configured with my most used control options (ISO setting, peaking color, etc) ... normally, I use FN set for Self-Timer and right dial button set for ISO. I wish there was a way to eliminate the control panel view since now I always have to press the MENU button twice to get to things I am actually looking for, which are in my Favorites menu. But that's a small nit. I use the User Profiles a good bit. I created my general personal profile first, with coded Leica M lenses in mind, and then developed the rest of them from that to quickly set up the camera for either a specific lens choice (R lenses or uncoded lenses like the Voigl\u00e4nder 10mm), or for a specific activity (copy work with the Macro-Elmarit-R 60mm, etc). I have the EVF-LCD switch set as an option on the right dial button, but honestly I only rarely change it from Automatic. In the field when shooting, I normally get 500-800 exposures on a charge, way more than I usually make in a session, so changing it for battery consumption reasons is somewhat unimportant to me. I find that I use this facility most when I'm doing things on tripod or copy stand and either want to lock the camera to the LCD or to the EVF so that it is not autoswitching the viewfinder all the time and being an annoyance. ISO setting is my usual choice for the right dial button, I switch it to focus peaking when I'm doing macro/copy/table top work because there are many situations when I need peaking to be either a different color or OFF in those situations. The FN button defaults to the self timer, since a wired remote cannot be fitted and it is often too much of a pain to fire up Leica FOTOs and link the camera just for a remote release for one picture; I use the self timer often for single shots where I don't want to have to try to hold the camera still and jig it into a stable position somehow. In copy work I switch it to control the exposure compensation, or white balance, etc, whatever I find need to control manually more of the time. My biggest issue with the CL as it is today is the same issue I have with any EVF/LCD camera: on a bright sunny day, the EVF or LCD brightness competes both with sunlight and with my 'transitions' darkening eyeglasses. The only workable solution so far has been to always have a floppy wide-brimmed hat available so that the sunglasses lighten up a little and the camera is shaded from the sun, minimizing dazzle. This works remarkably well. And I wish the CL had a remote release socket and accessory wired remote. \ud83d\ude31 Otherwise, I'm very happy with the CL body and have considered buying a second body as backup... I've not really needed a backup yet, though, in three years using the CL a lot. I guess when a good example comes up and I feel a little flush, I'll grab it. Or wait to see what they do with the so-far mythical CL2... LOL!

I bought the CL because I expected it to be a cheaper, lighter and smaller M10. It was my first digital Leica, heck my first digital camera in 1 or 2 decades! I wanted to use it with M mount lenses and I did not want to invest in another lens mount system. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to go back-and-forth between my also recently acquired M3 and my CL. Each time I grabbed the CL I wanted to see a shutter speed dial and an ISO dial. Furthermore, because of this Pandemic it didn\u2019t get used very much. Nevertheless, for those times I wanted good quality colour images, it was the only camera I took with me. In use, I found that pressing an up arrow in order to engage the expanded magnified view in the EVF was quite distracting.

There was never a time that I was able to act quickly, no chance of ever choosing the decisive moment with all this uncertainty at the controls. The histogram was my best security.

I\u2019m sure if I had spent some proper time with the camera and establish a way of working with it, becoming familiar with the unusual controls, then it would\u2019ve become second nature. However, after 9 or 10 months I was feeling uneasy about not being able to get out and use it, watching it depreciate, and I kind of panicked - sold it last week.

I posted recently re a test drive of the SL2-S with the SL24-70 zoom. In that post I conceded that the SL2, wonderful in many ways, is just too heavy for many out-and-about photographic purposes. Reflecting on that experience, I decided to test drive the Q2 next, while Leica are offering the opportunity. Here are some thoughts which might be of interest to other CL users. In the hand: just lovely. The form factor and controls will be familiar to anyone who has used Leica equipment for some time. I do prefer the visibly marked dials for aperture and shutter speed and the option of setting either or both to 'A' for automatic. For my purposes I would want to add the handgrip (I think I have purchased so many Leica handgrips over the years the cost would be enough to buy another lens). Viewfinder is excellent. Menu system is familiar. Weight is quite acceptable for a day's carrying and shooting. The zoom: The big difference with the Q2 is the opportunity to use digital zoom. I was sceptical about it, but the system is beautifully implemented and even the 75mm equivalent crop gives plenty of rich file quality to work with. The framelines approach suits me as a former M user. In fact, nicer than the M as there is only one, correct, frameline in the viewfinder at a time. The only thing I wish is that the cropped image could be displayed as an option. The table below is copied from Jono Slack's excellent review. I found it very useful and I do hope Jono does not mind me repeating it here (if you do, Jono, happy to delete it!) --img--  The images: The lens itself is very sharp and detailed. Obviously of very high quality. I would just say, I thought for some images it was too contrasty. And even with cropping, it is still just the one lens with its particular characteristics and look. Also, you will note from Jono's table the the depth of field corresponds to a much reduced effective aperture when you start to use the crop facility. For photos at 28mm the results are fine. If you are happy all day with a 28mm lens, or even at a pinch a 35mm, this camera will keep you smiling. All those shots came out beautifully. For longer effective focal lengths, this is just not the same as switching to, say, a 50mm Summilux-M. Overall, I think I liked the images better from the SL2-S and 24-70 zoom combination, but only by a hair\u2019s breadth and only as far as I have had time to process the initial batches. Finally, I did not notice the image stabilisation (on either camera, actually) so not sure it was needed at the focal lengths and lighting conditions I would typically use. I mention this because IBIS is frequently on the wish list for a hypothetical \"CL2\". With longer lenses I'm sure I would want it on the next CL too, but for 28mm to 50mm at least, I would not miss it. One significant weakness of the Q2 IMHO is the noise at higher ISOs - quite a lot of noise at 6400 compared to the SL2-S. In fact, many images at 6400 were just unusable. Maybe specialist software such as Topaz could help, but the starting position was poor. The leaf shutter is very quiet and discrete. Often I could not hear myself that the picture had been taken. Initially comparing the images to similar ones taken with the CL and TL23 or TL35 or the TL18-55 zoom, I would say it is difficult to see much difference at typical screen resolutions. The Q2 lens is sharper, as I mentioned, so the pictures have more zing than, say, the TL23 can provide. But I don't think they match the TL35, which is equally as resolving but with better and more subtle gradation - less \"in your face\". These are only provisional results because I want to work with the files some more during the week and do some more detailed comparisons. The high ISO noise performance of the CL is not very good either, of course. The old saying is, it takes a year to evaluate a lens properly, so I don't want to rush it. Would be delighted to hear how these experiences compare to others from CL users on this forum.

If you actually manage to succeed in your attempts to burn the wrong firmware into the wrong camera you are very likely to DESTROY your unspecified Leica camera. I don't even want to know exactly which camera you are trying update. It's your responsibility not mine, I just implore you to step back and re-evaluate your position. You appear to be in the wrong frame of mind to be attempting this procedure on whatever Leica camera in your possession. >>I'm confused. First, on the Leica website it says \"Firmware Leica Q (Typ 116)\" not Q2, though instructions say Q2. You're not only confused but mistaken too. The Q is Typ 116, I also have one. I have no idea as to what instructions you are looking that say to Q2. You must get it correct. >>Second, I downloaded two files: Q116_31_.quf and EN_Q2_Gen+FW-UPD+[PixMap+Touch-AF]+Release+Notes.pdf. Two files are usually made available - a quf and pdf. That Q116_31_.quf file is for the Q, I know because I have one and 31 is the last stable release issued. It would imply you are browsing the wrong area (unless you really are looking to update a Q). The other one you cite looks like it might be a helper PDF for a Q2... but I don't have a Q2 and will not comment further. The two do not fit together. Maybe you should clear your browser cache. What you are citing does not make entire sense. >>I'm not sure which contains the update. Since a pdf doesn't sound or look like update code, I just put the quf file on the card and followed instructions. Message I saw was no firmware update was found on SD card. The f/w update is contained in a quf file. Help is contained in a pdf file. To update the firmware you do put the correct quf file on the SD card and follow instructions. The message was probably correct in that it found no APPROPRIATE update file on the SD card (probably for the wrong camera etc). Basic checking is necessarily done to try to stop you destroying your Leica. >>Then, I put the pdf file on, same response.

I experienced this as well, as an old school photographer, I have never understood why one would want to poke around a touch screen to move the focus area, when all you need to do is focus in the middle and recompose whilst holding shutter half down. I think what will fix it is to go to Menu/Custom/Operation/Touch Settings/Touch Pad AF and set to OFF. Only problem I then has was the slide out quick menu on right of display has a quick button to switch on again! So what you need to do before changing to off, is leave it on and touch the screen to move it, then press Display button to move to centre.
