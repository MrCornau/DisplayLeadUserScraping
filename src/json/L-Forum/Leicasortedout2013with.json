Photographers trying to adapt their M lenses would be on their own then. Frankly I don\u2019t expect anything like a solution to the Italian flag problem coming from Sony. Is this really the right way to look at this? Leica has, largely, resolved the Italian Flag issues with the M9 with their own lenses. There will be exceptions to this, but let's accept that the Italian Flag issue can be resolved with the M mount and register distance of M lenses. Now, I accept that if Sony decide to do a full frame interchangeable lens version of the RX-1 (to avoid Nex discussions), they will need to come up with a new camera and new lenses, rather than trying to shoehorn a full frame sensor into the Nex format and E mount. Sony is a leading sensor manufacturer, and they are teamed up with Zeiss, who already make M mount lenses. What's stopping Sony from using the M mount on your analysis? The lenses are already there, and Sony makes sensors - surely they have the skill to make the micro lenses on their sensors and to write the software to deal with the Italian Flag? So, let's compare the two options: - a new mount, new camera, new lenses. It could be a very good thing, but wouldn't the required form factor (size) push them towards the same sort of design decisions Leica made back in 1953 when they came out with the M3? - a new camera using the M mount (perhaps with their own branded Zeiss AF lenses, and zooms), thereby attracting existing Leica M & R lens owners (not a huge number, but not insignificant either) and boosting Zeiss ZM mount lenses. As I understand the technical barrier to this, it is a sensor and software issue. I would expect Sony to have greater expertise in these fields than Leica - for the M9 they subcontracted to Kodak and Jenoptik, and for the M (typ 240) to CMOSis and brought the software coding in-house (if I understand correctly). Put it another way, which is more appealing or less costly and less hassle for Sony. A completely new system, or sensor and software design, which they are apparently good at? Against this, Sony do have a history of trying too introduce their own standards rather than using existing standards - how many times have they released products with their own storage media, their own batteries and adapters. Drives me crazy, and has put me off Sony on more than one occasion.
