First time Leica owner and loving everything about the Q. I've had my trusty Nikon D7000 with a collection of lenses for just about 7 years now, the starter Nikon D40 for 5 years before that, and was itching to upgrade. My shooting has mostly been street, landscape, 'artistic' and portraits in the past, and definitely have lots of content to shoot living in Brooklyn, NY. I was set on jumping into a Sony A7iii with a 24-105 and a wide angle prime but always came back to the Leica Q in all my research, cost comparing, reading, youtube, etc. Finally just decided just to go for it and give the Q a few months to see if it could work for my style and subject matter of shooting. I figured that worst case, if it couldn't be my only camera, that I would just sell for roughly the same price I paid in a few months. I started watching B&H, Adorama, and MPB used inventory for a few little while and scored a good deal (I think) on a very lightly used Q off of MPB a few weeks back. Ordered the MegaGear Half Case, Glass Screen Protector, B+W XS Pro MRNC Filter, and JFOTO Thumbs-up Grip right away to use with my Peak Design Slide Strap and quickly taped up the microphone and speaker ports. I've taken just shy of 1k pictures now and love how sharp and fast the focus is, handling is exactly what I wanted, size is a huge plus over the DSLR, and overall image quality and color rendition is amazing. I'm a Mechanical Engineer in Product Design as my day job, so of course I am in the middle of designing my own case that has an additional front finger grip, built in thumb grip (a la fuji xt-3), and a few other things. I have a few 3D printers so the idea is to try out the design and ergonomics with 3D printed models first, then when everything is perfect, have it CNC'd out of either aluminum or brass and coated black. I started the design by 3D modeling the Q. Love that a majority of the dimensions are nice whole numbers - exactly how I like to design parts. Now onto designing the bottom half of the case and working through a few iterations. Will update as progress continues. Any thoughts or input would be very much appreciated! --img--  --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/299948-my-first-leica-q-designing-a-case/?tab=comments#comment-3791554", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "299948-my-first-leica-q-designing-a-case", "result": true, "Selector": "3d printed", "selectorShort": "print", "MarkedSent": " hi everyone, new member here, just recently acquired a lightly used leica q and i'm falling back in love with photography. first time leica owner and loving everything about the q. i've had my trusty nikon d7000 with a collection of lenses for just about 7 years now, the starter nikon d40 for 5 years before that, and was itching to upgrade. my shooting has mostly been street, landscape, 'artistic' and portraits in the past, and definitely have lots of content to shoot living in brooklyn, ny. i was set on jumping into a sony a7iii with a 24-105 and a wide angle prime but always came back to the leica q in all my research, cost comparing, reading, youtube, etc. finally just decided just to go for it and give the q a few months to see if it could work for my style and subject matter of shooting. i figured that worst case, if it couldn't be my only camera, that i would just sell for roughly the same price i paid in a few months. i started watching b&h, adorama, and mpb used inventory for a few little while and scored a good deal (i think) on a very lightly used q off of mpb a few weeks back. ordered the megagear half case, glass screen protector, b+w xs pro mrnc filter, and jfoto thumbs-up grip right away to use with my peak design slide strap and quickly taped up the microphone and speaker ports. i've taken just shy of 1k pictures now and love how sharp and fast the focus is, handling is exactly what i wanted, size is a huge plus over the dslr, and overall image quality and color rendition is amazing. i'm a mechanical engineer in product design as my day job, so of course i am in the middle of designing my own case that has an additional front finger grip, built in thumb grip (a la fuji xt-3), and a few other things. i have a few -----> 3d !!!  printers so the idea is to try out the design and ergonomics with -----> 3d !!!  -----> printed !!!  models first, then when everything is perfect, have it cnc'd out of either aluminum or brass and coated black. i started the design by 3d modeling the q. love that a majority of the dimensions are nice whole numbers - exactly how i like to design parts. now onto designing the bottom half of the case and working through a few iterations. will update as progress continues. any thoughts or input would be very much appreciated! --img--  --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 6565, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "syam", "date": "2019-08-08 03:32:00", "content": "On 8/6/2019 at 3:55 AM, LexS said: - more space around the Thumbs button, impossible to use as designed now. - rear thumbs grip unnecessary: grip enhanced by the case already. - create a \"stop\" between the main switch single shot and continuous. - After 3D printing the case yesterday, I found that the buttons need more space to comfortably press, so I\"ll be changing the geometry around the buttons to have a more flush cutout. - I'm really liking the rear thumb grip addition on the case.

I don't necessarily disagree with you, but i don't particularly like how a half-case looks either. I would rather protect the camera with a cohesive design than not.

I've looked at the design of the Tekiac and think it's a good design, but I wanted something that would protect all sides and faces of the Q (as much as possible).

I can easily add a magnetic cover to block off the hot shoe that is easily removable. With this design there's no reason to use a thumbs-up as the case has a thumb securing grip already built in. Placement is also much better than the thumbs-up as it works with the thumb cutout on the camera (I have it also) and more like the Q2 thumbs-up placement. I also don't have a flash for the Q (yet) so have no need for the hot shoe - would rather have it covered up completely to avoid any dust or water entering from there. All great feedback. Thanks!

I have to ask myself which photo-related companies I trust.
