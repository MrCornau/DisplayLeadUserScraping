We are all wired differently Steven, as my 'favorite lens' is the F1 Noctilux as I own every iteration as they all render a bit differently.My story is I am lucky to have my Dad's 1968 F 1.2 Noctilux, then in 1975 right out of high school and earning really good money as a logger in Northern British Columbia Canada, I bought a brand new F1 very low serial number E58 F1 Noctilux which I still own to this day. I then bought the V2 in E60 in 1981, then the V3 right before the sliding hood V4's came out meaning it had the same late better lens coatings for improved contrast as the last V4 with the hopeless sliding hood. Just as you have a favorite Steel rim 35 1.4, I have a favorite F1 by a measure which is the original E58 1975 copy, then the V3 with the last F1 coatings, but they are not the same lens just as you have discovered in the early 35 1.4 pre-asph Summilux. I own a late German V2 titanium coated copy of the 35 1.4 Pre-Asph and it has better contrast than my also late German V4 Summicron, so I too respect they are all not the same as each other. Steven, I still say you may have stretched the envelope as to how many copies are needed, even possibly wanted of a single lens, yet the very fun part in this hobby is each to their own, plus we are all a bit crazy so whatever floats your boat so to speak! So enjoy what you like and I shall do the same and hope all the others here on the forum do so as well.

I can see where these prolonged discussions may take us, this thread is off shoot of other long threads on M10, sometime we just go in circles and make arguments while killing time. I agree with you, it is a pleasure to shoot with digital, started personal film journey in 1970s and except for a bit of nostalgia form time to time don't miss film at all. I also appreciate simplicity of M concept however my true equipment love are quality small lenses, camera body comes second. I would love to see M lenses paired not the most expensive with little merit but advanced camera Leica can produce. For instance current tastes shutter speed of 1/4000 is more about inability of the company to fit faster shutter than anything else, some like to see it/present it as part of Essential camera package. Stating 1/1000 is irony, such \"slow\" shutter speed has been already surpassed in leading SLRs back in late 1960s.

Over that five years to freshen things up and make it more \"mine\" I removed the paint in the lettering (M and at the back) and changed the red dot to black. I got quite uneven wear across the body but most of it was on the right side - once the paint started coming off it became quite easy to \"flake\". And over the course of those 5 years whenever I went out with the camera i did rub the exposed brass parts with my hands to try to even out the brassing (low-res pic, but you can see the paint \"chipping\" in the front-facing pic, rather than it being smooth). Not sure what i'd have done if i heard about sandpapering when I had the camera. I guess truth be told given I didn't think i'd sell the camera I wouldn't have shied away from meddling with its aesthetics more than just removing paint and replacing the red dot, so I'd probably have tried sanding more bits down.. Anyway now that i've sold that camera and it's been a while since I revisited pics of it, I do think the right side looks a bit too worn for my 2021 liking. And come to think of it while the camera had some pleasant compliments over the years, I did bump into more than a couple Leica \"aficionados\" commenting snarkily that the camera looked too worn and looks like it'd never been dropped, the top plate isn't dented, I never went to war with it, etc. etc. I wouldn't sand that M10R BP @Steven. It won't \"wear\" evenly like sanded copies but at least you know the marks came with use and time.

If you already have the Nikon equipment (DSLR with tele zoom), I just would use this for wildlife. I am in the same boat. I use the M10 as my main camera with lenses up to 90mm focal length. For wildlife, I kept my Nikon D500 with a 4/70-200mm lens. That works for the wildlife I am interested in such as pelicans. Like you, I investigated longer tele options for the M10. One could adapt a Leica R lens such as the 4/280mm APO currently available in the classifieds. One would need to use live view or the optional EVF and a R to M adapter. While I like the idea, I eventually decided against it for several reasons (costs; questionable support for R lenses; AF is quite useful for wildlife; some strange idea of mine that the D500 will be a future classic). I struggled with pelicans for weeks, trying both my M10 with 50, then 90mm lenses, and then with my Nikon gear which made everything so much easier. I've got a D750 and a Df, and mostly use my 80-200 which I bought used from KEH. Yes, the Nikon makes it easier, but when I'm traveling, do I really want to bring all my Leica gear and all my Nikon gear? Also, for people who are used to auto-focus, anything else probably seems impossible - but before auto-focus existed, I did just fine doing the work myself. Yep, the D500 is something I strongly considered, but I enjoy using my strange Df much more.... but to be honest, I'd like to be able to do all these things with my Leica, even if they are more of a challenge. When I started looking at tele lenses, I found a gazillion of the old Hector lenses, almost all of them on ebay, and some for very low cost. The more I read about them, the less I wanted one. I never considered a Leica R lens, but that kind of thinking, along with autofocus, would point me back at the Nikon gear I already have.

(i haven't been having problems with this - thanks to what you have already posted here, i am getting exposures that seem perfect, by viewing the histogram in the visoflex mostly - but i'm sure there is a lot that i still need to learn. maybe i already know enough right now, but i have this nagging feeling that i don't really know how to get the best compromise for exposure. ....and besides, if i'm not using the visoflex and/or live view, then what do i do?) the m10 has three metering selections, but if i read things correctly, if i'm not using live view or the visoflex, all i can measure is \"center weighted\". put differently, if i'm not using live view or the visoflex, it doesn't matter what i select - the camera will only do center-weighted. is this really true? i think i'm going in the wrong direction, as nowadays i feel more comfortable with the m10 if i use the visoflex. it also gets me gps information, which i prefer. it's sad that the visoflex uses up my battery so quickly, but it's beginning to feel like an essential accessory, which is also sort of effectively making my m10 into a \"dslr\", or more so, a mirrorless with all the tools that come with mirrorless. i prefer the simplicity of the basic camera, and would prefer to only use the visoflex for complicated situations, not as my normal camera attachment. you might read adams\u2019 classic trilogy\u2026. https://www.amazon.com/new-ansel-adams-photography-volumes/dp/b000nktmyw \u2026 or attend some basic photo classes or workshops. jeff", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4056, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "SoarFM", "date": "2021-02-21 15:51:00", "content": "Sigh, well here I am struggling with the same decision. I have a very beautiful M10P sitting here at my table for the last day. I\u2019m either keeping it or returning it along with another wad of money for an M10R. My last digital M was an M9 that I sold 6+ years ago, and to be truthful, I never got on very good with it. Terrible high iso performance, the shutter was anything but discreet and lack of live view is what finally made me give it up as mirrorless cameras came of age with CMOS sensors and high resolution EVF\u2019s. I tried to make my M lenses work on that infernal Sony A7r and A7r2, but never to my satisfaction. I just couldn\u2019t accept smearing. So I sold all but my 35 and 50 summicrons and put them aside with my M6 (also 35 years old) that I couldn\u2019t bear to part with for sentimental reasons. Turns out the Sony\u2019s output is really nice but every time I had to dive into a menu, I wanted to poke my eyes out, searching for some cool feature that was for some reason not working because some other setting change made that unavailable, well I had enough and got rid of it. Then some time with the MF Fujis including the GFX 100, but turns out it was more an exercise in chasing ultimate image quality while ignoring my unwillingness to actually haul that stuff around on a regular basis. Sold it all replacing it with a relatively more diminutive Hasselblad 907x, although still not an everyday driver...In the meantime I put together a Leica CL digital kit for actually carry about and practical family and family vacation photography. I really use the hell out of that kit, pandemic notwithstanding. Bought an M-L adapter for the M lenses on the CL, used it a few times but really just used the very remarkable 18-56 zoom that came with the CL. A Q2 was rationalized and added for low light indoor uses.\ud83d\ude00 Then I decided to start scanning my analog archive with a pre-owned Panasonic S1r (for the pixel shift multi shot function) and a Sigma macro. It is light years ahead of flatbed scanning and works so well I started putting film in my film cameras again, including the M6. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how pleased I am to have meaningful access to almost 30 years of negatives and slides to print on modern inkjets. I decide upon the S1r for scanning because in the back of my mind I was aware that I could put all my CL lenses (L mount) on the S1r and then have IBIS capability and 20 megapixels available\u2014if I wanted. Then took out the M-L adapter and put my 35 and 50 on the S1r. Wow! 47 megapixel of niceness and none of the edge smearing that I saw on the Sonys (2 paragraphs back), not perfect on the 35 but real darn close. Focus peaking worked great. But it\u2019s still more camera than I will carry around. For a moment I regretted not jumping right to the SL2 which has the clean interface I know from the Q2 and CL, but the S1r pre-owned was about $2k and an SL2 was going to be well over $5k and I wasn\u2019t convinced I would still carry it regular. I just can\u2019t picture myself buying Leica SL lenses, not because of the cost, but because of the size. No how, no way. But my appetite has been whetted to use my diminutive M lenses on a camera I will carry. And the sour taste of the M9 is gone and while most of my time here on the L-forum has been focused on Q and CL cameras I have been aware that the digital rangefinder has really matured. So I bought an M10-P. It is slim and beautiful, and oh, that shutter, what a change from M9 days! I was a bit concerned about how I would get along with the rangefinder (focus accuracy) since eyeglasses became a part of my wardrobe. I know that digital is more demanding of focus than film. It\u2019s going quite well, performance checking focus accuracy on the live view and picture review is very instructive. The fluid motion of focus and shutter release has returned helped out by setting 1/4f in auto. IBIS or high iso performance seem to serve the same function and now we have high iso performance, it places this camera in a different league of usability over film or the old M9. I\u2019ve also found that I can frame, focus and shoot (at least indoors) using solely the rear screen quite well. That\u2019s mostly how I use my Q2 indoors also. I am going to the Leica store tomorrow to pick up a Visolflex 020. I know some people swear by it, others say it sits in their bag unused. I get the feeling it is what will make the M useable, for me, close focusing (or critical focusing?) outdoors. The only real decision is do I exchange the M10P for the M10R? On the one hand, I am totally happy with the 24 megapixels of the CL for family photos and the Q2\u2019s 47mp is nice (especially cropping)but not a must have (for the family photos), on the other hand the M lenses on the S1r really do shine with all those megapixels (except maybe near the edge) and I am quite happy with the 50 mp Hasselblad and starting to think that 40-50 mp might be my sweet spot. I think I know what I am going to do. There is a part of me that thinks keeping the M10P might be false economy, or is it keeping a camera that is everything the M10R is, save a few megapixels?

I returned mine for an M10P, accepting a 3K loss in the process. Also, I don't want to add more problems on your plate, but I have heard early impressions from A1 users that M lenses are performing quite excellent on it. I have one on the side at my local retailer, might pick it up next week to try it. It might solve many of the things you didn't use to like. New menus, 50MP at 30fps (which means for fast action subject you could stay pressed on the shutter while slowly turning your focus ring from left to right or right to left, and choose which one has the sharpest focus in post among 60 shots \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d), extreme low light performance, new colour science which is supposed to be highly improved according to Gerald Undone... essentially the perfect hybrid camera, that can do it all, it a package half the size of the SL2, and very close to the Q2..... Let's see... P.S. I remind you that a few month ago I did a side by side between the M10R and the A7SIII with M lenses, and no one here could tell which was which. In the instance that there was a difference, the Sony was preferred in 90% of the situations in the blind test. So one could argue that the compact A1 could do everything (and more) than all the cameras you've mentioned in your post together. Only problem, its not a Leica.

Sold it all replacing it with a relatively more diminutive Hasselblad 907x, although still not an everyday driver...In the meantime I put together a Leica CL digital kit for actually carry about and practical family and family vacation photography. I really use the hell out of that kit, pandemic notwithstanding. Bought an M-L adapter for the M lenses on the CL, used it a few times but really just used the very remarkable 18-56 zoom that came with the CL. A Q2 was rationalized and added for low light indoor uses.\ud83d\ude00 Then I decided to start scanning my analog archive with a pre-owned Panasonic S1r (for the pixel shift multi shot function) and a Sigma macro. It is light years ahead of flatbed scanning and works so well I started putting film in my film cameras again, including the M6. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how pleased I am to have meaningful access to almost 30 years of negatives and slides to print on modern inkjets. I decide upon the S1r for scanning because in the back of my mind I was aware that I could put all my CL lenses (L mount) on the S1r and then have IBIS capability and 20 megapixels available\u2014if I wanted. Then took out the M-L adapter and put my 35 and 50 on the S1r. Wow! 47 megapixel of niceness and none of the edge smearing that I saw on the Sonys (2 paragraphs back), not perfect on the 35 but real darn close. Focus peaking worked great. But it\u2019s still more camera than I will carry around. For a moment I regretted not jumping right to the SL2 which has the clean interface I know from the Q2 and CL, but the S1r pre-owned was about $2k and an SL2 was going to be well over $5k and I wasn\u2019t convinced I would still carry it regular. I just can\u2019t picture myself buying Leica SL lenses, not because of the cost, but because of the size. No how, no way. But my appetite has been whetted to use my diminutive M lenses on a camera I will carry. And the sour taste of the M9 is gone and while most of my time here on the L-forum has been focused on Q and CL cameras I have been aware that the digital rangefinder has really matured. So I bought an M10-P. It is slim and beautiful, and oh, that shutter, what a change from M9 days! I was a bit concerned about how I would get along with the rangefinder (focus accuracy) since eyeglasses became a part of my wardrobe. I know that digital is more demanding of focus than film. It\u2019s going quite well, performance checking focus accuracy on the live view and picture review is very instructive. The fluid motion of focus and shutter release has returned helped out by setting 1/4f in auto. IBIS or high iso performance seem to serve the same function and now we have high iso performance, it places this camera in a different league of usability over film or the old M9. I\u2019ve also found that I can frame, focus and shoot (at least indoors) using solely the rear screen quite well. That\u2019s mostly how I use my Q2 indoors also. I am going to the Leica store tomorrow to pick up a Visolflex 020. I know some people swear by it, others say it sits in their bag unused. I get the feeling it is what will make the M useable, for me, close focusing (or critical focusing?) outdoors. The only real decision is do I exchange the M10P for the M10R? On the one hand, I am totally happy with the 24 megapixels of the CL for family photos and the Q2\u2019s 47mp is nice (especially cropping)but not a must have (for the family photos), on the other hand the M lenses on the S1r really do shine with all those megapixels (except maybe near the edge) and I am quite happy with the 50 mp Hasselblad and starting to think that 40-50 mp might be my sweet spot. I think I know what I am going to do. There is a part of me that thinks keeping the M10P might be false economy, or is it keeping a camera that is everything the M10R is, save a few megapixels? Sigh... My two cents (or one) after moving from the M10P to the M10R is that if you will be using the M for general family snaps indoor, never on tripod, and simply for fun then I would stick with the M10P. At first I argued against all of the shutter speed talk of needing high speed for the M10R but after many months of use I have to admit that it truly is a challenge and I keep around 120-200 minimum and even that can be challenging. But, the image quality is noticeably better with the M10R which is the only reason I haven\u2019t gone back to the M10P. I can see why it would be a hard decision.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/312268-m10-p-or-m10r/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-4146015", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "312268-m10-p-or-m10r", "result": true, "Selector": "i tried to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "19 minutes ago, soarfm said: sigh, well here i am struggling with the same decision. i have a very beautiful m10p sitting here at my table for the last day. i\u2019m either keeping it or returning it along with another wad of money for an m10r. my last digital m was an m9 that i sold 6+ years ago, and to be truthful, i never got on very good with it. terrible high iso performance, the shutter was anything but discreet and lack of live view is what finally made me give it up as mirrorless cameras came of age with cmos sensors and high resolution evf\u2019s. -----> i !!!  -----> tried !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  my m lenses work on that infernal sony a7r and a7r2, but never -----> to !!!  my satisfaction. i just couldn\u2019t accept smearing. so i sold all but my 35 and 50 summicrons and put them aside with my m6 (also 35 years old) that i couldn\u2019t bear to part with for sentimental reasons. turns out the sony\u2019s output is really nice but every time i had to dive into a menu, i wanted to poke my eyes out, searching for some cool feature that was for some reason not working because some other setting change made that unavailable, well i had enough and got rid of it. then some time with the mf fujis including the gfx 100, but turns out it was more an exercise in chasing ultimate image quality while ignoring my unwillingness to actually haul that stuff around on a regular basis. sold it all replacing it with a relatively more diminutive hasselblad 907x, although still not an everyday driver...in the meantime i put together a leica cl digital kit for actually carry about and practical family and family vacation photography. i really use the hell out of that kit, pandemic notwithstanding. bought an m-l adapter for the m lenses on the cl, used it a few times but really just used the very remarkable 18-56 zoom that came with the cl. a q2 was rationalized and added for low light indoor uses.\ud83d\ude00 then i decided to start scanning my analog archive with a pre-owned panasonic s1r (for the pixel shift multi shot function) and a sigma macro. it is light years ahead of flatbed scanning and works so well i started putting film in my film cameras again, including the m6. i can\u2019t emphasize enough how pleased i am to have meaningful access to almost 30 years of negatives and slides to print on modern inkjets. i decide upon the s1r for scanning because in the back of my mind i was aware that i could put all my cl lenses (l mount) on the s1r and then have ibis capability and 20 megapixels available\u2014if i wanted. then took out the m-l adapter and put my 35 and 50 on the s1r. wow! 47 megapixel of niceness and none of the edge smearing that i saw on the sonys (2 paragraphs back), not perfect on the 35 but real darn close. focus peaking worked great. but it\u2019s still more camera than i will carry around. for a moment i regretted not jumping right to the sl2 which has the clean interface i know from the q2 and cl, but the s1r pre-owned was about $2k and an sl2 was going to be well over $5k and i wasn\u2019t convinced i would still carry it regular. i just can\u2019t picture myself buying leica sl lenses, not because of the cost, but because of the size. no how, no way. but my appetite has been whetted to use my diminutive m lenses on a camera i will carry. and the sour taste of the m9 is gone and while most of my time here on the l-forum has been focused on q and cl cameras i have been aware that the digital rangefinder has really matured. so i bought an m10-p. it is slim and beautiful, and oh, that shutter, what a change from m9 days! i was a bit concerned about how i would get along with the rangefinder (focus accuracy) since eyeglasses became a part of my wardrobe. i know that digital is more demanding of focus than film. it\u2019s going quite well, performance checking focus accuracy on the live view and picture review is very instructive. the fluid motion of focus and shutter release has returned helped out by setting 1/4f in auto. ibis or high iso performance seem to serve the same function and now we have high iso performance, it places this camera in a different league of usability over film or the old m9. i\u2019ve also found that i can frame, focus and shoot (at least indoors) using solely the rear screen quite well. that\u2019s mostly how i use my q2 indoors also. i am going to the leica store tomorrow to pick up a visolflex 020. i know some people swear by it, others say it sits in their bag unused. i get the feeling it is what will make the m useable, for me, close focusing (or critical focusing?) outdoors. the only real decision is do i exchange the m10p for the m10r?

I\u2019ve only had the camera for a week now but I don\u2019t seem to have any issues with camera shake vs. the M10P, but to be honest I only had the M10P for a coup;le days and the M10R hasn\u2019t really seen wide usage in real life, just a bunch of test shots. I will accept that even if I didn\u2019t see a night and day difference, I\u2019m sure that there is a difference, that is the nature of working with a higher resolution sensor. So far I\u2019ve been using 1/4f as min shutter speed and I\u2019m OK with that. I put a diopter correction on the rangefinder and have now learned how to slide the eyeglasses up with my hand and I have the crisp clear viewfinder to work the rangefinder and the rangefinder is dead on. I had always struggled with the M9 rangefinder. I had actually noticed that my 50 Summicron wasn\u2019t dead on with the rangefinder at closer distances and sent that and its 35mm cousin into Leica for a CLA that was 25 years overdue, I asked them to pay special attention to focus calibration. Sadly the problems ran a little deeper, Leica has pronounced the 50 Summicron unrepairable with haze and coating damage between rear elements that are no longer available. \ud83d\ude22. I was never in love with the 50 Summicron and am wondering if perhaps it is due to what amounts to a \u201cbad sample\u201d? Lens arrives back tomorrow and I will examine it closer because I never noticed any obvious defects.

on the one hand, i am totally happy with the 24 megapixels of the cl for family photos and the q2\u2019s 47mp is nice (especially cropping)but not a must have (for the family photos), on the other hand the m lenses on the s1r really do shine with all those megapixels (except maybe near the edge) and i am quite happy with the 50 mp hasselblad and starting to think that 40-50 mp might be my sweet spot. i think i know what i am going to do. there is a part of me that thinks keeping the m10p might be false economy, or is it keeping a camera that is everything the m10r is, save a few megapixels? sigh... ok, so what did i do...? i exchanged the m10p (and some cash) for the m10r. i\u2019ve only had the camera for a week now but i don\u2019t seem to have any issues with camera shake vs. the m10p, but to be honest i only had the m10p for a coup;le days and the m10r hasn\u2019t really seen wide usage in real life, just a bunch of test shots. i will accept that even if i didn\u2019t see a night and day difference, i\u2019m sure that there is a difference, that is the nature of working with a higher resolution sensor. so far i\u2019ve been using 1/4f as min shutter speed and i\u2019m ok with that. i put a diopter correction on the rangefinder and have now learned how to slide the eyeglasses up with my hand and i have the crisp clear viewfinder to work the rangefinder and the rangefinder is dead on. i had always struggled with the m9 rangefinder. i had actually noticed that my 50 summicron wasn\u2019t dead on with the rangefinder at closer distances and sent that and its 35mm cousin into leica for a cla that was 25 years overdue, i asked them to pay special attention to focus calibration. sadly the problems ran a little deeper, leica has pronounced the 50 summicron unrepairable with haze and coating damage between rear elements that are no longer available. \ud83d\ude22. i was never in love with the 50 summicron and am wondering if perhaps it is due to what amounts to a \u201cbad sample\u201d? lens arrives back tomorrow and i will examine it closer because i never noticed any obvious defects. happily, the 35 doesn\u2019t seem to have been afflicted with same problem and is getting overhauled. now i have to shop for a 50... not the news i wanted.... the 50 summicron and summilux are the two candidates. going to leica dc and put the lens on my camera and test in store and neighborhood near store. go home. pixel peep. make decision. edited march 4 by soarfm", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4436, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Jeff S", "date": "2021-03-10 22:13:00", "content": "1 hour ago, hdmesa said: The M10-R samples from DPR I downloaded and opened in Capture One \u2013 I can't tell them apart from the M10-P I have since they used the 50 Chron I have, too.

I remember how my resolution for 2020 was to decrease the number of systems, high lead to adding the amazing Xpan, the delightful Pixii, and a timeless Hasselblad 503cw with the 907x, and a set of lenses for each, all Xpan ones and several CF/CFi ones (Pixii takes the M ones). And 2020 was the year of M10M and M10R upgrades. And I finally got the M9M as well, to compare all three Monochroms. Also the first CCD Leica for me. Without it, would I ever get the amazing panoramas of Death Valley on Xpan? Dreamy sunset shots with the 250 Sonnar? The beautiful B&W shots?

I now have a V1 that I prefer at night (it flares better) and a V1 that I prefer in the day (it's sharper in the center). So I started buying more of the same lens.

I think there\u2019s a good chance that waiting until November might save somebody $500-$1000 on a 10 bodied camera. I disagree with you that M10 prices came down much - if any. At least here in the US M10 prices hover constantly about the same amount since about a year. The M10 standard version still goes for about $4200-4500, and the M10-R for about $7500. I am following prices closely since I am interested in a M10-R but not for the currently given price range. Regarding your point about the M8 - if you read my earlier comment, this is what I tried to explain that earlier models showed a more significant improvement from version to version. I also see the new potential features of the M11 differently in value. A game changer for example could have been IBIS or some sort of hybrid OVF/EVF which we likely won't see. Many expected/hoped for something like this. I am cautious if the new sensor is such a big game changer in reality - currently this is all a marketing hype so far. Backlit sensor can have benefits, but IMO it is not a big game changer either. Battery, memory (likely not even a second SD card slot!), just another (more expensive) external EVF is IMO not a biggie to justify an upgrade for many. The M11 will sell if the features as mentioned are true but not be such a big game changer like the M10 was which gave the significant benefit of smaller body size, higher ISO, higher DR, and in case of the M10-R higher resolution. I don't think we will soon a significant $1K value drop in M10 versions.

And there is downsampled (S or M) Raw - which reduces the number of pixels (i.e. resolution) by downsampling - and then stores that lower-rez picture in a RAW envelope (i.e. leaving WB, sharpening, etc for the photographer to adjust as desired in post-processing.) Both will reduce file size - but s/mRAW reduces the actual resolution and number of pixels, while compression does not. I experimented with Canon's sRAW1 from a 21 Mpixel 5D2 - and got 9 Mpixel .RAW images instead of the whole 21 Mpixels the sensor could provide. SRAW2 delivers 5.2 Mpixel pictures. That is a lot of fine detail thrown away - but it isn't necessarily required for some pictures, so it is a worthwhile option to have available. Leica has gone back and forth on using compression on their RAW format (Adobe's .DNG file type) over the years. Some cameras always compress the .DNG files (plain vanilla M10), some never do (Monochroms?), and some have allowed a user choice (M8?, M9? - I forget which). In all cases the number of Mpixels stayed the same, with or without compression. For 84Bravo: The plain M10 compresses (losslessly) all .DNGs, with no user option for uncompressed .DNGs. Not sure about the M10-R and M10-M cameras. I agree with Photoworks that the file size of 40 megabytes (from 40 megapixels - but don't confuse them) implies some compression to all .DNGs already. ...................... It has been suggested (but not by Leica - yet) that the hypothetical M11 will have 1) a 60 Mpixel sensor, with 2) a user option for downsampled .DNGs like s/mRAW (converted to fewer pixels) - i.e. the user will be able to shoot in .DNG but have the option of getting full 60 Mpixel files, or (for example) 24 Mpixel or 15 Mpixel images, as their needs require. That would actually be a plus for me. I would have been happy to stick with the M9's 18 Mpixels forever (with the other improvements of the M10: ISO, new VF/RF, smaller dimensions). And for journalistic work (as used to be done with Tri-X), even 15 Mpixels would be perfectly acceptable, 90% of the time. s/mRAW (or s/mDNG) is a good way for little old Leica to simulate Sony's Alpha7, Alpha 7s and Alpha 7r - without having to make three separate cameras with three different sensors. Landscapers, general shooters and photojournalists can all get what they need out of one body, just by making a selection in the menu. EDIT - it should be noted that Adobe software (Camera Raw) will recompress .DNG images (since it is their own proprietary format) - if and when a picture is opened for post-processing and then saved. Once. For example, an M10 image file I have not yet worked on in Adobe Camera Raw may have a file size on disk of 30 megabytes. But once I have made adjustments and saved them, the file size will be, say 24.46 megabytes. After that, it will stay at 24.46 megabytes forever. I have a feeling Adobe removes Leica's own in-camera compression, and substitutes its own thereafter - a minor savings is disk space.

When I made an inquiry to buy a SE 21, but got lucky with a mint condition demo WATE for $4,500 from my Leica store. It came with a warranty, but no case or box. A new one is $6,200, so I took the opportunity to save money. I've had the WATE for 2 weeks now. So far so good although I have only given it a basic work out to make sure that the lens functions okay at all three focal lengths. The lens is reasonably sharp with good micro contrast. I found myself applying slightly more \"detail\" in Capture One Pro than I would with other Leica lenses. I'm looking forward to shooting more architecture shots and interiors to see if this lens fills the bill. The only disappointment with the lens is that the metadata shows a focal length of 16mm regardless of the actual focal length used. I'm looking forward to taking this lens with me along with my standard kit, the Summilux 35mm and APO-Summicron 50mm, on my next travel vacation.

It's a bit \"tarte \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me\" to say that we never need anything more, that everything is already great, that those who need more are not real photographers..... Someone can translate \"tarte a la creme\" please ? No I don't think you are being rude Steven, but of course we all have different opinions and many hold them perhaps to be more valid than the others. In truth anything goes in regards to what tools we choose to use each person comes at those choices in differing ways. What's right for you is probably not right for me and that really doesn't matter especially so in regards to our choice of cameras that we make to express ourselves in the images we make, or try to make anyway. But what does matter I think is that we listen to others with an open mind because ultimately that's how we learn ourselves without necessarily concurring with the other person's point of view. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have the best gear one can afford to work with, the best tools will not make you a craftsman but sometimes they can make the journey more pleasurable. Back to the M10-R........Yes it's a noble effort by Leica, I salute it, and yes I too was extremely interested in buying one but unlike you I did find a loaner for a week or so and like you I found some aspects of the camera not agreeable for how I want to work with a M at this time, so I didn't buy one, I stuck with my other M10's and I'm pleased to have done so. I have said here on the forum that I've seen nothing in regards to the posted images that for me would make me regret not having swapped up to a R, but that isn't to say that those reasons do not exist for others. We are all different but what does and should matter more is that despite what gear we use we push to grow our creativity and expression rather than getting trapped in the mire of believing that the newest and the shiniest toy, ( or bag, or half case ), will suffice to get us there. \"tarte a la creme\"......hmmm?

However, when I uploaded the first card the immediate response was 'F&*k Yes' The files are just much nicer - although the colour is a little different, something to get used to. So, in my book the real advantage of the R is in the handling of highlights, which was always the weakspot of the M10 sensor - I feel that there is a stop of recovery in the M10-R, and then add in the fact that the base ISO is half that of the M10-P and you have nearly 2 stops more headroom, which is really significant shooting wide open in bright sunlight. It also means that when shooting in contrasty situations you don't need to protect the highlights, and that in turn makes it less likely that you will block in the shadows - so you have an obvious noise advantage here as well. Then - let's talk ISO - I think that Sean and I came to the same conclusion, which is that the noise levels were about the same at 100%, but of course that gave the M10-R a significant advantage because of the higher resolution. So, Yes to your question, when you match the file dimensions the M10-R has a significant advantage with ISO (maybe 1/2 stop, but taken in conjunction with the highlight advantage it's significant). . . . and the cropping - is really useful - especially in close up situations, and also using wider lenses. I've always been a 50mm guy, but with both the SL2 and the M10-R I've found myself shooting wider - cropping to 50 is no disadvantage compared to the M10-P but if you don't need to then you have more resolution. But it's the 'look' of the files which really gets to me every time I shoot with both - I have a much loved M10 as well, and tend to shoot it together with the M10-R with different lenses). It seems to me that the \u00a3600 extra for an M10-R is the best money you can possibly spend right now! Sorry - that doesn't sound very measured or restrained! but I feel quite strongly about it! All the best Jono sensible advice for new perhaps in terms of price, but I still think that the high resolution is lost much of the time at low hand held speeds. Of course its worth having the extra headroom and resolution when needed, no question but the M10 is fine for me now.

I have an M6 which I love and I am now thinking about getting a NEW digital Leica M so that I can use the same M-mount lenses and consolidate a little. Currently I have a Voigtlander 35 mm/1:1,4 Nokton VM II but I will look at other lenses in the future (28/50 Leica or not this is still to be confirmed). But the idea of having just one film camera and one digital camera with the same mount, the same ergonomics and the same characteristics (if you will), is very very attractive. Potentially I could keep the GR3 for everyday kind of snapping tool, and have the two Leicas for a more sort of introspective and slowed down photography. Now, besides the technicalities, I am wondering why should I go for the M10-P or the M10-R, considering the small price difference. A few things I have been pondering on: - I do not need a 40MB sensor. - I may need long exsposures capabilities of the M10-R (by looking at my pictures' exif I see only in one occasion I had to use iso 1000 at 240 seconds, one at iso 100 at 240 seconds, and one 1600 iso at 30 seconds. last one being astro which is a completely different beast and I would not even try to accomplish good results with a tool like the M series. Having said that, if the camera has decent capabilities, why not?) - I am wondering how much the M10-R battery life is impacted (for a street shooting in particular), compared to the M10-P. - I like the discreet touch of not having the Leica red button (I can probably just hide it somehow, but I do not want to risk damaging it in case I need to sell the camera at some point). - Would compatible lenses such as Voigtlander and Zeiss perform ok with such a big sensor the M10-R sports? Thoughts? Thanks in advance I made the decision that 24mp is best for street at the moment. 42mp is more susceptible to shake. I had real issues with a ARiii even with OIS.

As I now have the SL2 and only plan to use my Ms mainly with the lenses I think work best on them (28 / 35 / 50), I could still have my M10s into the next decade! That makes sense to me, though I must say that I'd be interested in an M11 with 24 MP, if it took the path of the SL2-S. Not for video, but for dealing with highlights. I'm thinking about the degree to which one has to underexpose with the M10 when shooting into the light or with strong sidelight, sometimes as much as 2 stops. It seems to me that, compared to the M10-R for example, the overall the dynamic range of the M10 is the same, or even a smidgeon greater; but the distribution of the DR is weighted more to shadows than to highlights. That is, I believe, what makes people say that the DR of the M10-R \"better\". In other words, I would prefer if Leica had applied a different, flatter, contrast curve to the M10 DNGs \u2014 possibly that could be done in a firmware upgrade, although highly unlikely. But in a new M11, I would expect this issue would be solved and could make the highlight treatment more like shooting negative film. Until then, I think the M10 is great. _______________________Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/318320-my-new-m10/?tab=comments#comment-4147889", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "318320-my-new-m10", "result": true, "Selector": "i need to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " 2 hours ago, chris_tribble said: -----> i !!! \u2019ve had my m10s since launch, and despite the improvements in the newer iterations -----> i !!! \u2019m still not persuaded -----> i !!!  -----> need !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  a change. a future model with ibis? a future model with evf? better latitude? higher mp? as i now have the sl2 and only plan to use my ms mainly with the lenses i think work best on them (28 / 35 / 50), i could still have my m10s into the next decade! that makes sense to me, though i must say that i'd be interested in an m11 with 24 mp, if it took the path of the sl2-s. not for video, but for dealing with highlights. i'm thinking about the degree to which one has to underexpose with the m10 when shooting into the light or with strong sidelight, sometimes as much as 2 stops. it seems to me that, compared to the m10-r for example, the overall the dynamic range of the m10 is the same, or even a smidgeon greater; but the distribution of the dr is weighted more to shadows than to highlights. that is, i believe, what makes people say that the dr of the m10-r \"better\". in other words, i would prefer if leica had applied a different, flatter, contrast curve to the m10 dngs \u2014 possibly that could be done in a firmware upgrade, although highly unlikely. but in a new m11, i would expect this issue would be solved and could make the highlight treatment more like shooting negative film. until then, i think the m10 is great. _______________________frog leaping photobook", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 10573, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "scott kirkpatrick", "date": "2021-01-29 19:16:00", "content": "26 minutes ago, erudolph said: The firmware update installation instructions has this info: Displaying the auxiliary frame: Select the function \u201cUpright\u201d > \u201cWith Auxiliary Lines\u201d to display the cropping frame calculated by the camera.

I'll confirm again tomorrow that I need to change the camera. 11 minutes ago, adan said: An SD card problem can slice and dice pictures - it cannot change the exposure! So this is a shutter problem of some kind. Something is causing the second set of blades, that closes the shutter opening (and times the exposure), to suddenly stick (first image) or slowly lag behind more and more (second image with \"fade-out\"). Producing overexposure, with a hard or fuzzy edge, of about half the picture. It is not a \"release\" problem, since it only begins halfway through the exposure. It could be an intermittent physical jamming or \"braking\" of the lightweight shutter blades (which slide over one another) by specks of dust or grime, or possibly congealed lubricant. Which interferes with the smooth travel of the \"closing\" shutter. I suppose with today's \"motor-driven\" (as opposed to spring-driven) shutters, it could be the drive motor for the second set of blades also not spinning smoothly, which could be an electronic fault, or a physical obstruction. Question not asked yet - were these taken with \"Live-view/EVF\" in operation? I.E. the shutter open for electronic viewing, and then closing/opening/closing again for the actual exposure?

And more gear posts. Please don't take it wrong, but my advise would be just stick to what you have and enjoy it. I saw your insta posts and you take beautiful pics. Just keep doing that. It gives more satisfaction than another model camera. Thank you for the compliment about my pictures. No better thing to hear at the beginning of the week. Regarding my frequent acquisition of gear, no offense taken. I'd like to say though that it is not GAS, IMO. I discovered the Leicaverse just a year ago, when I bought an M6 out of curiosity for film (which is now replaced by an M7). With Leica, I discovered a new aspect of photography which I never knew. The pleasure of shooting, almost as an addiction. The feeling of using a camera. Since then, I have been a quest to find my perfect setup. Some can do it based on forum and other experiences. While I value these and spend time on the forum, I also need to try the products for myself to know if it will suit... me ! So this is what ive been doing, going back and forth, buying, selling, rebuying. It's tedious, but once it's successful, it brings a great deal of peace. Shooting stills and videos, I needed first a a hybrid mirrorless. After trying every one of them on the market, I finally settled for the SL2-S. I love it to death, even if I had to make a sacrifice: AF. I know this camera will be my hybrid solution for the years to come and no other one can dethrone it for now. As a smaller, more fun to use camera, I have loved my M10P since the first day. I still love it today and don't need the D. But I became very curious about it. Something attracts me to it. It looks so much to use. I want to acquire it because I want to see if it can perfect further my shooting kit. I feel like it could be a great complement to by very advance SL2S's EVF and screen. It might not work for me, in which case not all will be lost. Maybe just 15/20% of the price ill pay for it when I resell it. But it could work, and make me want to give up my P. Who knows ?! In the meantime, rest assured, I continue to take photos with my M10P, and I'm constantly inspired, regardless of my gear considerations.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317108-do-you-like-you-m10-d/?tab=comments#comment-4121257", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "317108-do-you-like-you-m10-d", "result": true, "Selector": "i had to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "1 hour ago, poli said: as stated by chasdfg there are quite a few (recent) threads about the m10-d. it's my only camera and i do really like it. it is a lovely camera to use and hold in your hands. i have it for about two years now and don't lust after an m10-r. actually i am more lusting at reducing gear nowadays instead of adding. last summer i did buy an m4. although beautiful and lovely to shoot, i have sold it again. the more gear i have, the more often i am confronted with choices (which lens do i take, etc.). i want to keep it simple. i believe i've read posts from the op about going from an m10-r to an m10-p. and more gear posts. please don't take it wrong, but my advise would be just stick to what you have and enjoy it. i saw your insta posts and you take beautiful pics. just keep doing that. it gives more satisfaction than another model camera. thank you for the compliment about my pictures. no better thing to hear at the beginning of the week. regarding my frequent acquisition of gear, no offense taken. i'd like to say though that it is not gas, imo. i discovered the leicaverse just a year ago, when i bought an m6 out of curiosity for film (which is now replaced by an m7). with leica, i discovered a new aspect of photography which i never knew. the pleasure of shooting, almost as an addiction. the feeling of using a camera. since then, i have been a quest to find my perfect setup. some can do it based on forum and other experiences. while i value these and spend time on the forum, i also need to try the products for myself to know if it will suit... me ! so this is what ive been doing, going back and forth, buying, selling, rebuying. it's tedious, but once it's successful, it brings a great deal of peace. shooting stills and videos, i needed first a a hybrid mirrorless. after trying every one of them on the market, -----> i !!!  finally settled for the sl2-s. -----> i !!!  love it -----> to !!!  death, even if -----> i !!!  -----> had !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  a sacrifice: af. i know this camera will be my hybrid solution for the years to come and no other one can dethrone it for now. as a smaller, more fun to use camera, i have loved my m10p since the first day. i still love it today and don't need the d. but i became very curious about it. something attracts me to it. it looks so much to use. i want to acquire it because i want to see if it can perfect further my shooting kit. i feel like it could be a great complement to by very advance sl2s's evf and screen. it might not work for me, in which case not all will be lost. maybe just 15/20% of the price ill pay for it when i resell it. but it could work, and make me want to give up my p. who knows ?! in the meantime, rest assured, i continue to take photos with my m10p, and i'm constantly inspired, regardless of my gear considerations.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 11785, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "evikne", "date": "2021-01-22 12:45:00", "content": "At least up to 3 stops raising in post (equivalent to ISO 1600) is no problem for me.

And while I may not know, nor do any of us know, just what the percentage of electronic failure is in Leicas, it is appalling. These are supposed to be \"the best\" that the camera world has to offer. And the reports of Leica's failure to repair correctly or to be unable to repair at all are very disappointing.

And I sure would like to read of electronic successes rather than the litany of failures, right here on this board. And any number of folks reporting that their cameras are working just fine cannot erase the reports of camera failure and botched repair by Leica. It may be alright for other folks. For me it is not. The comment that the Leica is like an old Jaguar, to be taken out and gently driven on weekends sums it up. Lucas electrics, Smith gauges, SU carbs and constant oil leaks. An apt comparison.

All of what you have written has merit. And as a working pro I have no doubt you cherish you Leica(s). But when we look at the numbers, 0.15% is a poor showing. This is indisputable. And I do not think it is an indication of just who the \"smart people\" are who buy cameras. There is a possibility that the poor showing is not just about price. Leica owners have among their numbers a fanatic following who will brook no criticism of the product. I think they sometimes border on the irrational. The Leica lenses are being challenged by other lenses at a fraction of their cost. I'd love to see a Leica-Zeiss-Voigtl\u00e4nder comparison. I'd love to see a head-to-head between Leica and something from the Sony/Canon colossus. It might be interesting. At the end-up, though, it is not gorgeous color or definition which will carry the day it is content. I have to work on that more than the arcane glitches of camera software and firmware. Buying a camera which accepts very good lenses but has \"sometimes\" electronics is challenging. I have not yet had a failure with my Leicas so I cannot crab about that. But many, many others have. Yes, he project manager who put together the Sony menuing system should be flayed alive. But that is a \"set it and forget it\" situation rather than an existential threat. And the Sony E-mount lenses are very good. So Leica has a struggle in front of it yet. Yes, there will always be the ~0.10% who will buy them plus the stragglers and the curious. But if Kaufmann cannot reach his targeted 1% market share just how much longer will Leitz carry the camera line? Alpa was a great camera, too. I do not know if you read this excerpt from the Barnack Blog, \"Both the Leica M10 and the M10-P are premium products with a sumptuous finish and delivering superb image quality, in spite of the fact that Leica usually hasn\u00b4t got the cream of the crop digital sensors (a scope in which Sony with its huge electronic expertise and massive wherewithal invested on R & D and Canon are the technological spearhead, as well as having enough economical resources to manufacture better and better sensors within short periods of time).\" You see, there is the rub.

I didn't mock non-professionals; I was just suggesting that often it's not the camera that is the limitation. Cameras from 10 days ago and 10 years ago are both typically far more than any photographer would or should need for 80% of their shooting. Always chasing the latest and greatest rarely leads to better photography. Instead, I was encouraging the OP (and others who followed) to grab a camera that inspires them (no matter how old it is) and master their craft. 23 hours ago, Ko.Fe. said: This over generalization on cameras from different times needs one specific correction. Even 10 days ago APS-C camera needs flash if you are indoors, objects are moving and you want them all and have to use f5.6 at least, if not f8. While FF camera from two years ago will let you do it without flash and still get acceptable results..

It sounds to me like you\u2019re describing an M-mount phone-camera with better ergonomics and no display. I think there might be appeal to that, but not under the M badge. Aperture priority is very slow when you don\u2019t like the camera\u2019s evaluation. Half-press and recompose would exclude a number of photographers who cannot operate the button with that precision, say due to gloves in the cold or neuromotor challenges. And shooting a series with consistent exposure would be maddening. If dials are bothersome, then an AE-L button might be an alternative, but I appreciate being able to check exposure settings at a glance, even before the camera turns on. A base ISO of 800 would be delightful if it came with two stops worth of improvement in color and tone discernment, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m not willing to throw away the opportunity for maximum quality for convenience just to avoid having to decide which I want to prioritize, though. On-off: eye sensors merely detect light, with darkness implying the user\u2019s face is nearby, so the camera would turn on frequently when in a bag. And it would turn off when removed from the eye for a low-angle or overhead shot. Maybe combine with a capacitance sensor to detect skin or similar material? That\u2019s an unintuitive complexity, though. I think removing the power switch is a design statement, not a useful feature. An accessory shoe is a must, though if the base camera merely has a threaded anchor with a plug and I have to add the shoe as an accessory, that\u2019d be fine. Bonus points if the plug also covers up a wired flash sync socket. If I was okay with an EVF, I wouldn\u2019t be shooting an M. Or provide an EVF with enough dynamic range to comfortably compress the full visual dynamic range continuous monitoring; self-lit pixels are moving in that direction, but I suspect we\u2019re 10+ years away from anything I\u2019d consider more than tolerable. If an electronic shutter is global or even reads out as fast as a mechanical one, great. Otherwise, stopping motion and shooting in artificial light will be showstopping issues. Unaided focus will only be acceptable when the focus screen is as visually large as the final output on close inspection. Like other aids on an M, it isn\u2019t necessary all or even most of the time, but they do serve a purpose. I suppose this only applies to an EVF version, though, which would be a nonstarter for me anyhow. I like the QR code to apply settings idea. Faster than wifi, easy to store, replicate, share, and troubleshoot. So, backing up, which of those removals that I find limiting might be useful not in a general purpose camera (as if an M were that already) but for a narrower niche than an M-D? I think exposure controls are non-negotiable. Automation with the ability to immediately override is fine. But having automation as default would best be implemented with computational approaches: applying adaptive auto-levels, local contrast, and other enhancements to the live stream in order to optimize image capture settings. In my mind, the shutter dial is not a burden but an essential part of the very definition of intentional photography. It need not retain the same form, place, or interface, though. Sensitivity is also an exposure control, but whereas film emulsions could be formulated over a continuous range and readily interchanged, sensors are fixed in camera and rarely have more than two actual sensitivity options. I think the interface should provide control over the tool, not control of a facsimile of another tool as a wrapper around the actual instrument. \u201cISO\u201d should be discarded except in between-camera comparisons; the camera\u2019s sensitivity should be controlled with a toggle; and the practical purpose of \u201cISO\u201d on digital cameras served, if at all, by exposure compensation. If exposure is manual, exposure compensation can also be done manually, so that is not needed here. Here\u2019s where I make a suggestion that other people will discard like I have done above\u2014 Let\u2019s get rid of framelines. Framelines require the entire viewfinder to include a beam splitter; without them, only the rangefinder patch and indicators would need an image overlay, so the rest of the finder could be as bright as accessory finders and the finder itself might be easier to offer in multiple magnifications. Framelines are useful learning a new lens, but when I\u2019m in a flow I am oblivious to them as I have already previsualized the angle of view. Then, I use the finder to tweak focus, exposure, and placement. This wouldn\u2019t be a camera for learning whether you want to shoot 35 or 50; this would be a camera for people who already see the results and just need tools to help them share what they see with other people. The rangefinder patch indicates frame center, the rest is left to the photographer\u2019s skill; this doesn\u2019t strike me as radically different from the coarse but predictable simplicity of center-weighted metering. Thus, my proposal for a minimalist M: - Shutter button with half-press, full-press, and mechanical release threading. - Around the shutter, in the front, is the exposure toggle. Push left a bit to increase speed by a half stop, more for a full stop, or all the way for two stops. Pull for the opposite. This makes it easy to slam the toggle in response to a rapid change in light without spinning the shutter dial halfway around; it retains the directional muscle memory of M shooters; and it moves this key adjustment closer to the shutter release. - Show shutter speed in the viewfinder for two seconds after changing its value, whether from auto or manual changes. Show metering gauges on either side of the speed values. This value won\u2019t be visible otherwise, which is unfortunate; but there are times when I want to see the actual speed in the finder, not just relative metering evaluations. Win some, lose some. - Add an indicator to the viewfinder: solid means \u201cbuffer full,\u201d slow blinking means \u201cyou\u2019re not going to be able to keep shooting much longer,\u201d and fast blinking means, \u201cok, love you, bye now.\u201d Open the bottom plate to identify the cause of blinking, as you\u2019ll have to do this anyway to replace battery or memory card. LEDs next to the battery and memory card provide the status of each; discussed below. The memory card LED also lights up if still writing when the bottom plate is open, but otherwise there is no \u201cwrite in progress\u201d indicator. - Battery and memory are consumable. If built in, they must be user-serviceable with off-the-shelf parts for me to be interested if there is a viable alternative. In fact, the more replaceable parts the better; I think Leica could win a lot of approval by releasing component specifications to the public when a device becomes obsolete. By that time, newer devices would offer enough features to attract customers; this would do nothing to diminish the wow-factor of new products or the impulse purchase of items as luxury goods. It would, though, allow photographers to drive up used prices, making full-price items more appealing to everyone. It would also dramatically underscore how repairable some of these items are relative to mass-market competitors; it would provide further proof that Leica is more than just a prestige brand, of how quality extends well beyond marketing spec sheets. Bury trade secrets within each component, if need be, but allow us the opportunity to design replacements to spec in the decades to come. Engineers in growing economies can do amazing things with their entirely different set of risk/reward choices than folks like me experience in the pinnacle economies; give them a chance to contribute and maybe open up a whole new potential employment pool for Leica. But I digress. - Around the shutter, in the back, is the sensitivity toggle. As a concession to the fact that not everybody loves watching light, it might have an A setting, so, if the sensor has base and amplified readouts, the toggle options would be: base sensitivity, amplified sensitivity, and aperture-priority exposure with auto-selection of sensitivity. In A mode, the front toggle becomes exposure compensation. - The on-off switch moves to under the baseplate. This assumes the camera will power down quickly enough to save power, but will start back up again from a warm state in less than 50ms. I suspect this will require keeping at least part of the sensor package powered on but idle, so a large and extremely low leakage capacitor might be necessary\u2026 but this is a niche of a niche camera, so make it happen. The result, though, is that you turn the camera on after inserting the battery, and only need to turn it off when done shooting \u2014 when, often enough, you\u2019ll be removing the card anyhow. A mild inconvenience when placing the camera in a bag, say, for lunch; this is outweighed by the \u201cset and forget\u201d convenience in a camera that is actively and continuously used, not strapped on in case a photo op might arise. - Moreover, the SD card becomes the power switch. The well is deep enough so that the card can be mechanically retained and easily gripable when electrically released. Pushing the card in to make electrical connections turns the camera on; pushing it again to release it turns the camera off and electrically disconnects the card, but mechanically holds the card so it won\u2019t fall out. (Yes, I\u2019m saying the rumor of moving away from the baseplate disappoints me. It does leave a first impression of affectation, but opening it simultaneously exposes those vulnerable bits that most cameras protect behind multiple small hinges and grit-prone gaskets. Gaskets are good, but they fail, and failure of them on a small hatch means no protection while failure of a gasket around a plate still leaves pretty good protection. Plus, I like the heft of brass for stability and its malleability in camera-killing accidents, which combine well with the thinness and rigidity of magnesium in the core and inner shell. The feel of air pressure when opening or closing the plate provide an aesthetic sense of a well-made machine, which would be an affectation if it weren\u2019t necessitated by the aforementioned functionality. Yet the baseplate is in no way essential to make an M.) - The top plate has a 3/8\u201d threaded anchor where the hot shoe would go. At the bottom of the well is a PC sync connector. (I can\u2019t recall how much clearance those cables generally require, though.) The threading has a stop like on the screwed-in lens hoods to align screwed-in accessories. A simple flush-fit plug would be standard; Leica could provide a basic screw-in hotshoe; and third parties could provide affordable cold shoe options. In addition to being cleaner than a shoe-filling plate for most people and providing a flash sync for studio shooters, this would likely be a mechanically superior connection for add-on thumb grips. TTL is out, but that seems insignificant for this camera\u2019s intended audience. - No framelines, but a brighter finder with the potential for magnification options. - In jest, some users might want a time-lock device on the lens release. You said you wanted to shoot one lens for a month, right? - Of course: raw files only, although the thumbnails can be set to a jpg style like in other cameras. - Finally, advanced customization. Under the bottom plate is another toggle-and-button combo with four settings. First, save current settings to jpg image of a QR code. Second, take a photo to read a QR code and apply settings; blink indicator lights appropriately. Third, reset to defaults. Last, status check; blink the SD and battery LEDs once for >75% remaining, twice for >50%, four times for >25%, and solid for <10%. Push the button to perform the action, which will turn the camera on then off if needed. Close the bottom cover and the switch reverts to status check. In sum: the shooting interface has two toggles around the shutter button, the range-finding viewfinder, and the mounted lens; plus a normally flush-fit, gap-free accessory dock, strap lugs, and tripod anchor. No other interface or indicator is visible or accessible with the bottom plate in place. Yet, none of the following functions are lost: manual control of exposure, including sensor sensitivity and potentially going past mechanical into electronic speeds; optional aperture-priority with exposure compensation; flash sync with either cable or basic hotshoe, albeit with an accessory; rangefinder focusing; center-weighted metering; arbitrary array of customization, including setting storing and sharing, albeit requiring another device (which would be easy to reverse engineer and replicate); useful status indicators for the buffer, battery, and memory card. With QR customization, things like processing settings for the raw-file thumbnail, bracketing, and auto-exposure inflection points (e.g., keep shutter speed over 1/60) remain possible. Ignoring my suggestion to remove framelines impairs nothing else, but I do think this would be a level-up on removing the display that yields, and is necessary to yield, a substantial improvement in viewfinder brightness.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323254-forget-the-m11-d-we-want-the-m-a-d/?tab=comments#comment-4250546", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "323254-forget-the-m11-d-we-want-the-m-a-d", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i like the thought experiment. it sounds to me like you\u2019re describing an m-mount phone-camera with better ergonomics and no display. i think there might be appeal to that, but not under the m badge. aperture priority is very slow when you don\u2019t like the camera\u2019s evaluation. half-press and recompose would exclude a number of photographers who cannot operate the button with that precision, say due to gloves in the cold or neuromotor challenges. and shooting a series with consistent exposure would be maddening. if dials are bothersome, then an ae-l button might be an alternative, but i appreciate being able to check exposure settings at a glance, even before the camera turns on. a base iso of 800 would be delightful if it came with two stops worth of improvement in color and tone discernment, but i\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how it works. i\u2019m not willing to throw away the opportunity for maximum quality for convenience just to avoid having to decide which i want to prioritize, though. on-off: eye sensors merely detect light, with darkness implying the user\u2019s face is nearby, so the camera would turn on frequently when in a bag. and it would turn off when removed from the eye for a low-angle or overhead shot. maybe combine with a capacitance sensor to detect skin or similar material? that\u2019s an unintuitive complexity, though. i think removing the power switch is a design statement, not a useful feature. an accessory shoe is a must, though if the base camera merely has a threaded anchor with a plug and i have to add the shoe as an accessory, that\u2019d be fine. bonus points if the plug also covers up a wired flash sync socket. if i was okay with an evf, i wouldn\u2019t be shooting an m. or provide an evf with enough dynamic range to comfortably compress the full visual dynamic range continuous monitoring;

(i can\u2019t recall how much clearance those cables generally require, though.) the threading has a stop like on the screwed-in lens hoods to align screwed-in accessories. a simple flush-fit plug would be standard; leica could provide a basic screw-in hotshoe; and third parties could provide affordable cold shoe options. in addition to being cleaner than a shoe-filling plate for most people and providing a flash sync for studio shooters, this would likely be a mechanically superior connection for add-on thumb grips. ttl is out, but that seems insignificant for this camera\u2019s intended audience. - no framelines, but a brighter finder with the potential for magnification options. - in jest, some users might want a time-lock device on the lens release. you said you wanted to shoot one lens for a month, right? - of course: raw files only, although the thumbnails can be set to a jpg style like in other cameras. - finally, advanced customization. under the bottom plate is another toggle-and-button combo with four settings. first, save current settings to jpg image of a qr code. second, take a photo to read a qr code and apply settings; blink indicator lights appropriately. third, reset to defaults. last, status check; blink the sd and battery leds once for >75% remaining, twice for >50%, four times for >25%, and solid for <10%. push the button to perform the action, which will turn the camera on then off if needed. close the bottom cover and the switch reverts to status check. in sum: the shooting interface has two toggles around the shutter button, the range-finding viewfinder, and the mounted lens; plus a normally flush-fit, gap-free accessory dock, strap lugs, and tripod anchor. no other interface or indicator is visible or accessible with the bottom plate in place. yet, none of the following functions are lost: manual control of exposure, including sensor sensitivity and potentially going past mechanical into electronic speeds; optional aperture-priority with exposure compensation; flash sync with either cable or basic hotshoe, albeit with an accessory; rangefinder focusing; center-weighted metering; arbitrary array of customization, including setting storing and sharing, albeit requiring another device (which would be easy to reverse engineer and replicate); useful status indicators for the buffer, battery, and memory card. with qr customization, things like processing settings for the raw-file thumbnail, bracketing, and auto-exposure inflection points (e.g., keep shutter speed over 1/60) remain possible. ignoring my suggestion to remove framelines impairs nothing else, but i do think this would be a level-up on removing the display that yields, and is necessary to yield, a substantial improvement in viewfinder brightness.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13740, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "tedd", "date": "2021-07-12 21:22:00", "content": "On 7/10/2021 at 10:41 AM, jaeger said: In the audiophile world, some people claim they can hear the differences between lossless and uncompressed music.

I just asked myself a thousand times: what do I like about the M7, what do I like about the M10P, what would I like about the M10D.. I turned the problem upside down and always come to the same conclusion. I like the look of it. The image it gives. It's a little embarrassing, I guess, but it's the truth. I prefer my M10P and the digital benefits and workflow in every way over the M7. Its more reliable, the photos are nice, its more versatile, and I do love to see my pictures asap, and be able to edit in Lightroom without having to walk in the rain and drop off the rolls, then wait for hours. Today, the only reason I still use the M7 is because of a feeling. The feeling to do something traditional. Its because of the look that it gives me. By the look, I mean the image of shooting film. I think it's cool, it's trendy, and I like doing it. If I had both the M10P and the M10D, I would probably use it this way: - Whenever I go out on my own, for street or landscape photography, or if im at home with my kids, it would be the M10P and the possibility to review my photos, delete them on the go, change my settings, etc.... It's just more reliable to me this way. -The M10D, you saw it coming, would be the body I take when im not alone. When im going to diner with friends, and photographing people in general. It's the body I would take to \"look cool\", and to...... pretend that I still take photos on film. There, I said it. I admitted the truth, to you, but more importantly to myself. I don't want the M10D because I like shooting without a screen. I actually prefer the screen. I want the M10D to pretend to others that I still shoot an M7. The truth is, it does have an impact on the photos I take. I saw it particurlary when I made my switch from Sony/Canon to Leica. With my 1DX and a 24-70 on, my wife used to be annoyed when I brought the camera with me. I always looked like \"the photographer\". She was annoyed to have that big thing pointed at her all the time. It resulted in... how can I say it.... blurry photos. Now with my M7 or M10, she doesn't see me as an awkward photographer, but more as an artist. She's more inclined to pose for me. Poeple in general would feel intimidated with my big setups. Now, with an M, they are more intrigued, and they want their photo to be taken. Here's a little anecdote to finish my post.

However, what it cannot do is render the extra fine detail that is produced by high-resolution sensors, as it is simply not there in the file. So no, it cannot replace a high-resolution sensor. And it can use a 40 MP file and give it the same boost again. No doubt that you capture tinier things with a higher-res sensor, given the same lens (assuming the lens resolves them... which is not a given with a lot of older glass, especially focused by old eyes). I think high MP sensors help sell expensive lenses (which have no point unless you can blackboard a big system resolution) and facilitate steep crops. Those sensor also help preserve a sufficient data volume with more severe forms of post-processing perspective correction. But the world has largely settled around 24mp mirrorless cameras, which suggests that statistically, that's acceptable for most uses. We're coming onto the eighth or ninth year for the Sony A7 line where the main camera still 24.2mp and includes models as late as July 2020 with 12.1mp(!) sensors. And certainly, a massive uptick in responsiveness or reliability in a camera can make an incidental upgrade compelling. For example, the M8/M9 architecture got to an 18mp resolution, but from the M240 on, the user experience improved considerably. More data was just a plus. My questions about obviation have more to do with having sufficient resolution for any size output than they are about catching the tiniest cheek fuzz of a 21-year-old woman in a head shot. I'm not sure that the smallest meaningful aesthetic level of detail has really moved off the \"texture of concrete\" or a \"non-aliased eyelash.\" Even in landscapes, I'm not sure that any picture has been made or broken by being able to resolve a telephone wire at 1000m vs 2000m. If there is an identifiable subject in a picture, it's hard to point to one that is defined primarily (or even appreciably) by the smallest thing a sensor or film grain can see. There is an \"ooh and ah\" factor to the microscopic, but that's for discussion sites. In prints, the only place you are not discarding most of the data for an output, the real mark a camera needs to hit is to create enough data about sufficient levels of detail aesthetically and enlarge for a normal viewing distance without adding blur or artifacts. Ansel Adams believed that this might take as few as 1 megapixels, which is obviously low, but the point remains that the bigger the print, the greater the normal viewing distance. This is the theory upon which depth of field relies - circles of confusion. By the numbers, you need 120dpi at a 1.5m viewing distance. From an M9, that's a 43.3\" (110cm) print, which is frankly enormous. Obviously with the M240/M10 you get a 50\"/127cm output at that resolution. My testing of Super Resolution was prompted by a project where I was making large prints (18\"/46cm short side) for a client from 24mp M files and wondered what the resulting image files (300dpi) would look like in an unrealistic 100% view on screen. If they don't show artifacts at that size, unrealistic as it is, there is zero real-world chance that anyone would detect issues in the finished prints, no matter how close they got to them. And when the prints from this experiment came back yesterday, they stood up to the 40cm scrutiny test (that's about the expectation for an adult's eye to even focus). So no pixels, no artifacts on a close-up look in person, on a print. The ultimate installation location for these would not allow a human to approach closer than 1.5m, so rescaling was always overkill anyway. I did read Margulis' article on unsharp masking and Super Resolution. I know what he wrote, but if his illustrations are indicative, his conclusions seem to assume a much higher tolerance for halos on high contrast edges. I didn't see the results as exactly equal, and the point of the machine learning is to cut down on that.

I was just looking through flickr photos and I'm aware that by specification M240 and M262 color rendition should be the same. But browsing Flickr I can detect some variation... Just me? Having owned my M262 since new, the only M body, digital or film, I've ever bought new, and having used it alongside second-hand M240's and M246's (M262 is the only one of the three I still own today) and one M9P since, the one thing for sure the M262 IS, is considerably lighter without that heavy duty brass top plate. Certainly does not seem to cost in terms of overall quality/stability. \"Colors\"-wise, well, how do you process your files? If you capture a subject using the dng file format of any of these cameras you can make them looks pretty much just about any way you want. Note I didn't say IDENTICAL but then my M9 files probably don't look anything like someone else's M9 files and M9 raw files offer much less flexibility in the shadows in terms of being able to extend the dynamic range on that low-end of the range and you need that ability as the highlights cut off pretty darn abruptly in M262/M240/M246 files. You HAVE to expose files from the M240 family of cameras for the highlights and make the shadows work in post-processing which, fortunately, can work extremely well. I process M262 raw files in Adobe Camera raw and find the \"Adobe Landscape\" profile the perfect STARTING POINT for outdoor image files from the M262, but after manipulating the various sliders in the basic, color mixer/color grading panels, I can make pretty much any image look the way I want. What else should anyone really need or want? What I have noticed the past year using the M262 alongside a CL outfit, the CL's one generation-newer sensor gives me a pretty darn good indication of what the newer M10 model series sensor offers in better high ISO (above ISO 3200), as good as M262 shadows are to work with, the dynamic range/flexibility of CL raw files is on a higher level, even in terms of highlights head room. The higher ISO limitation of the M262 is partially offset in the speed of the lenses with the 35/1.4 FLE, 75mm f2 APO, 135mm f3.4 APO and the outstanding super-wide image quality of the 21mm Super Elmar.

It still takes great pictures and that's what I ask to a camera. I would rather invest my money (little) in lenses than in an awfully expensive camera that will quickly drop in price with time and just give heavier files. I'm not at all a get-the-new-camera guy and the next Leica M that will convince me to part from my M240 will have to provide me with much consistent features than 20 Mp more and some higher ISO. Maybe it will be the M15. Agreed - just that I have seen the difference between 36 and 24 MP with full frame sensors, and it is hard to go back after upgrading to higher resolution and dynamic range. This said, I found my workarounds with my M-E 240 to compensate for its much thinner dynamic range. Its in-camera HDR file creation is pretty decent and helped me out in a couple of difficult lighting situations even without tripod.

Briefly, I would say good B&W often requires (1) a great deal of processing on the overall image as well as, when the light is difficult, selective burning or dodging, and (2) digital B&W has to deal with the quality of the highlight roll-off and with the \u201cgreat balls of fire\u201d (as the song goes) \u2014 meaning the bokeh-balls\u201d that can dominate the image, especially when there are bright lights in the background of a night scene. Thinking abut this, I looked at some night shots in Bangkok that I made with the M9 a few years ago. As the M9 has weak high-ISO performance, the best way to shoot it at night is to expose at ISO 640 and \u201cpush\u201d exposure by as much as 2-4 stops in post-processing. Interestingly, I find that my favorite M9 night shots were made with my 21mm lens (Elmarit-M 21 ASPH, at ISO 640 and f/2.8 and exposed with a shutter speed as low I could go handheld: 1/30 sec, 1/60 sec etc. That means, in the SOOC image, often almost nothing is visible. With this way of shooting the highlights, for example neon lights from shops or food carts on unlit, dark Bangkok streets looked beautiful: in other words, no bokeh-balls. Now, I take it that your M10-M shots in Dubai were taken with a Summilux 35mm pre-ASPH (or sometimes with a Summilux 35AA?), mostly at f/1.4. Shooting with a 21 lens at f/2.8 is equivalent (I suppose) to f/4, or perhaps sometimes even f/5.6, on a 35mm lens in terms of what\u2019s going to happen to the bokeh-balls because of the reduced DOF. There can also be an issue with veiling flare, especially with the 35mm pre-ASPH. It seems to me that you should try night shooting with the M10-M and a 35mm lens at high ISO, say, 12,500-50,000 at apertures of f/4 and f/5.6 and see what happens to the highlights in the background.

I'm buying new stuff very carefully, and so far I didn't make any wrong decision, yet with Leica M. I don't want to own gear I don't use. So this lenses kit with M10 plus a M10M would work as charm. As mentioned before in other threads, I will soon (within next 3-6 months) switch my primary camera system. And it's a lot of new stuff. So the budget for the Monochrom magically disappears lol. Bye-bye, Nikon D5, and DSLR monsters. I'm ready for an EVF \ud83d\ude42 I'm waiting for the release of the new Sony A7IV, the Nikon Z9 and The Canon R3. Once all these cameras are out, among the SL2-S, I will make my choice. Of course I have already preferences and ideas, but let's wait and the decide. . Now, back on topic. High iso performance it's important to me. I have a system of fixed and faves f/stops, SS, and iso... Having a camera like the M10M would make my workflow even faster. The M246, how does it perform with high iso? With my M10, I usually don't go beyond 3200. 6400 only when REALLY needed. So, a great 12500 iso (only) would be a huge step forward for me. I use M246 and when I really \u201cget creative\u201d indoors and after sunset my minimum ISO is 3200 and up. Long lenses like 50, 75 and 90mm for me turn sharp images with 4xFL shutter speed. If you wish to freeze movement very quickly your ISO ramps up, shooting at /500 sec is good light territory. For me M10M is incremental upgrade, heck, old M246 have advantages in its own right, solid battery, everybody likes good long battery life, and video if that is your thing. I\u2019ll wait to see what M11 platform brings to the market, for what I wish and want I may have to wait for a bit longer, M12 at least (EVF version, IBIS), I can wait, M246 is not going anywhere. M246 up to iso 6400 is excellent, it will tolerate bit of underexposure, above 6400 it is ok but you must be careful not to underexpose, for night shots I would even slight overexposure, expose for shadows. You mention Canon/Nikon/Sony mirrorless, I use Z7, it\u2019s IBIS is real game changer, I never had so many images at low ISO. I keep an eye on Z9 rumour mill with aim to pair with forthcoming 200-600, already have 70-200 among few other Z lenses, interesting times ahead.

First, the usual disclaimer: virtually every Leica M lens is amazing. If you get what you can afford you will probably not be disappointed. Now that we got that out of the way... I previously had the latest Cron 35mm and now I have the Lux 35 FLE. My decision to switch was based partly on past attempts to adapt the Cron, first to the Sony A9 and later to the SL2-S. Additionally, I mostly shoot at 35mm, so I think of the 35 Lux FLE as like having two lenses in one. During the day when I am out and about, I stop down and it is a great street lens and on the M10M it is so sharp you can practically cut your finger. When the light goes down or when you want to grab an environmental portrait, you have the ability to open all the way to 1.4 and get some nice bokeh. When used on the SL2-S, I find it actually balances a little better than the Cron. On the M10M it is a little heavier and a larger profile than the Cron, but I'm so used to it now, I can't even imagine it any other way. In retrospect, I think the Cron on the M10M would have been more than enough, especially stopped down for street photography, but now that I've made the switch, I'm very happy with the Lux FLE and it is without a doubt the best lens I've ever owned for any camera since I was able to hold a camera in my hands.

If you have the cash available i would say jump on it and start out with a 35mm Summicron or Summilux as your first M lens. M cameras are very different from DSLRs, but IMHO they are quite easy to learn. My first rangefinder was a Hasselblad XPAN and I had no trouble learning to use it. It's a given that the M camera rangefinder is much a more precise and refined RF device than the Fujifilm built XPAN's rangefinder.

I mean if you were to buy one lens would it be the 35 instead of a 50 or even a 90? @James1975 Given the choices of 35mm, 50mm or 90mm for an M10 Monochrom, I would go with the 35mm. With a 63\u00b0 angle of view, it can be used for environmental style portraits and the 35mm covers a lot of other bases very well. With a 35mm lens, you can get some distortion of facial features if you get too close to your portrait subject, so you have to keep that in mind. The 50mm works better as a portrait lens, but I find its 47\u00b0 angle of view to be too constricting - particularly when shooting in close quarters or indoors except for very large rooms. I have come to think of my 50mm as short telephoto for that reason. Sometimes 50mm is the focal length I need, though. It depends on the subject and the location. Of the three focal lengths, the 90mm would be the best strictly for portraits; its 27\u00b0 angle of view will allow you to get frame filling head shot type portraits without distortion and will give you a good bit of working distance from your subject, which will help them to be at ease. The 90mm would not be a good choice as an all around, one lens one camera kit, though; the field of view is too narrow for optimal all-around applications IMHO. Regarding lens selection for Leica M cameras, I have come to view the 28mm, 35mm and 50mm as the best choices for all-around shooting, with 24mm, 21mm, 18mm, 90mm and 135mm focal lengths being more specialized. 28mm and 50mm are my most often used focal lengths with 35mm coming in next. I have never had a 75mm Summicron M, but have always liked that lens. It can be very useful as a portrait lens while not being as much of a niche lens as the 90mm Summicron that I own. In my view, a great two lens kit would be a pair of Summicrons - a 35mm and a 75mm. For a one camera one lens kit, I would probably go for a 35mm lens, even though I seem to have usually gravitated to a 28mm more than a 35mm. The 28mm requires you to get closer to your subject to fill the frame, but gives your images a more dynamic, more three dimensional look - to my eye. The 35mm gives you a bit more working distance and produces images with a more relaxed look, for lack of a better term - again, to my eye, at least; others may see things differently. Each focal length lens requires a different approach to shooting with that lens in order to maximize results. Hope this will help in making your lens choice.

I\u2019d be quite interested to hear your thoughts after that, and seeing image comparisons between the same shot brim both cameras... This thread dates back to one year ago, when I was musing about the M10-M and the, then, expected M10-R. Since then, there's no dilemma for me: I subsequently decided to keep the M10. Basically, I still feel that 24 MP is the \"sweet spot\", especially for my high contrast photography, because I doubt that the 40 MP of the two new Leica cameras will give me anything but increased cost and possible problems with camera shake. With regard to the latter, have you seen some of the posts by @Steven, who found that shooting with the M10-R he had camera shake at shutter speeds below 1/250 sec. Some LUF posters claim that they can handhold the M10\u2013R at 1/60 and even 1/30 sec. However, as I often go for \"immediacy\", I doubt that I would be able do that on a consistent basis with the M10-R or the M10-M without IBIS, even if it could work for me for some images. In this respect, I'm encouraged to see that Leica has introduced the S2-S with a 24 MP sensor, which I hopes indicates that there could be a 24 MP. But all this goes back much further for me. On the old CompuServe photo forum, as well as on the old Leica forum on photo.net, people used to say that if you wanted to print larger than 11\u00d714 inches you should go to medium format. But I have always liked the \"35mm aesthetic\". Around 2005, I saw a Moriyama Daido retrospective at the Gallery of New South Wales, which showed 60 large prints (60 by 40 inches) shot with Tri-X and printed with an Epson wide format printer. The prints were dazzling, and didn't need medium format film. A few years ago, Moriyama had another exhibition at the Cartier Foundation in Paris: this was all digital work that he shot with a camera that had a tiny sensor, the Nikon Coolpix 6500, I believe. Indeed, I made a print from the Ricoh GRD at 58 x 45 inches print that I like a lot. And, of course, I have 60 by 40 inch prints made from the M10 without any problem. But that is the, usually, high-contrast, expressionist, and \"rougher\" look that I like. Of course, I understand that other photographers will prefer a 40 MP camera. The other issue you referred to is that of a color camera versus an M-Monochrom. When I had the M-Monichrom, I also had a M9-P. Essentially, I shot then alternately in \"binges\" of month, or so, each. When I reviewed my B&W images from these two cameras, I found ones I liked from both; but I concluded that I preferred the flexibility of using \"digital filters\" in Lightroom or Silver Efex with the camera to shooting with the Monochrom and sometimes using glass filters. And of course, all the Leica Monochroms are great cameras and I understand who people like them. ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/305689-m10-monochrom-vs-m10-%E2%80%94-and-generally-color-camera-vs-bw/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4126001", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "305689-m10-monochrom-vs-m10-%E2%80%94-and-generally-color-camera-vs-bw", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "15 hours ago, cayenne said: i might suggest renting a m10m, and shooting shots with it side by side with your color camera, and compare the experiences shooting and in post...? i\u2019d be quite interested to hear your thoughts after that, and seeing image comparisons between the same shot brim both cameras... this thread dates back to one year ago, when i was musing about the m10-m and the, then, expected m10-r. since then, there's no dilemma for me: i subsequently decided to keep the m10. basically, i still feel that 24 mp is the \"sweet spot\", especially for my high contrast photography, because i doubt that the 40 mp of the two new leica cameras will give me anything but increased cost and possible problems with camera shake. with regard to the latter, have you seen some of the posts by @steven, who found that shooting with the m10-r he had camera shake at shutter speeds below 1/250 sec. some luf posters claim that they can handhold the m10\u2013r at 1/60 and even 1/30 sec. however, as i often go for \"immediacy\", i doubt that i would be able do that on a consistent basis with the m10-r or the m10-m without ibis, even if it could work for me for some images. in this respect, i'm encouraged to see that leica has introduced the s2-s with a 24 mp sensor, which i hopes indicates that there could be a 24 mp. but all this goes back much further for me. on the old compuserve photo forum, as well as on the old leica forum on photo.net, people used to say that if you wanted to print larger than 11\u00d714 inches you should go to medium format. but i have always liked the \"35mm aesthetic\". around 2005, i saw a moriyama daido retrospective at the gallery of new south wales, which showed 60 large prints (60 by 40 inches) shot with tri-x and printed with an epson wide format printer. the prints were dazzling, and didn't need medium format film. a few years ago, moriyama had another exhibition at the cartier foundation in paris: this was all digital work that he shot with a camera that had a tiny sensor, the nikon coolpix 6500, i believe. indeed, -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  a print from the ricoh grd at 58 x 45 inches print that -----> i !!!  like a lot. and, of course, i have 60 by 40 inch prints made from the m10 without any problem. but that is the, usually, high-contrast, expressionist, and \"rougher\" look that i like. of course, i understand that other photographers will prefer a 40 mp camera. the other issue you referred to is that of a color camera versus an m-monochrom. when i had the m-monichrom, i also had a m9-p. essentially, i shot then alternately in \"binges\" of month, or so, each. when i reviewed my b&w images from these two cameras, i found ones i liked from both; but i concluded that i preferred the flexibility of using \"digital filters\" in lightroom or silver efex with the camera to shooting with the monochrom and sometimes using glass filters. and of course, all the leica monochroms are great cameras and i understand who people like them. ________________________frog leaping photobook", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 24131, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "eawriter", "date": "2021-02-03 01:21:00", "content": " I have this same issue with my M10M and M10.

I've found my skills are rusty ... the fundamental intentions are there but some of the habits have been lost. So I'm treating my M9 like a new-to-me camera. Here's one interesting thing I've found that I wasn't even aware of beforehand: the difference between compressed and uncompressed raw files. Background: the M9 offers raw and JPEG formats; raw files can be either compressed or uncompressed. The compressed files are half the size of the uncompressed files, so this is not a data-oriented lossless algorithm (like .zip files) nor a visually oriented lossy algorithm (like .jpg files). My understanding is that the uncompressed values are bit-shifted to fit 8-bit containers, which is a very fast operation for computers to perform (and bit-shifting a 16-bit value to an 8-bit value is mathematically the same as taking a square root). Then, when processing the raw file, those 8-bit values are expanded to 16 bits. A raw value of 255 (clipped white) becomes 255^2 = 65,025, a value of 254 becomes 254^2 = 64,516, and so on until a raw value of 2 becomes 4, with 1 and 0 unchanged. Thus there are gaps between the possible values that the raw photo processor can interpret, much like tines in a comb: it simply isn't possible for an 8-bit raw value to tell the image processor that the captured value was 3 or 65,026. If you then turn around and output a .jpg file, the image will be re-compressed to 8 bits and the image is, as far as this goes, unchanged. However, if you manipulate the photo, you're theoretically losing out on a fair amount of precision that might cause visible artifacts. (Note that the sensor package outputs 14-bit values, so the range of values actually lost is not as large as going from 16 to 8, but remains numerically substantial. Yet is it photographically significant?) Previously, I had assumed that truncating each datum meant that lost data was taken from the shadows, so I tested by pushing images and looking for artifacts. I never found any, so I always shot compressed images. Upon this reanalysis, I am convinced that I was wrong: information is lost evenly throughout the entire range of values. To test for visual effects, I took several photos of a corner of a room with a white wall with gradual tonal transitions. That wasn't useful. But, the photos did include a few wall hangings, and while not in precise focus there is enough detail for me to draw conclusions adequate for my purpose. Comparing two shots with the same exposure and similar framing, one compressed and one uncompressed, I used Rawtherapee to apply absolutely minimal adjustments -- no sharpening, no noise reduction, and the \"fast\" and simple demosaicing method. I took white balance off the same spot in each image. Then, to simulate the kind of image processing that could theoretically cause issues, I applied a fairly steep, but not unreasonable, curve. I examined the images on a high-DPI but not photo-specific monitor. Then, to simulate more realistic conditions, I applied my usual demosaicing settings but did nothing else, e.g. with sharpening, noise, etc. Finally, I desaturated the images because I almost exclusively work in monotone. There are seven attached images (I'm not sure how to inline images I'm uploading to the site): The curve used. Basic raw processing, uncompressed file. This has the tall, flat histogram. Basic raw processing, compressed file. This has the jagged histogram. Normal raw processing, uncompressed file. This image is rotated slightly clockwise of its counterpart. Normal raw processing, compressed file. In addition to rotation, this image's histogram has a green bump just before going hitting the right edge. Normal raw processing, desaturated, uncompressed file. Normal raw processing, desaturated, compressed file. Note 1: the \"basic raw\" images have a raw-value histogram that does not change with image processing; the \"normal raw\" images have histograms that reflect the full image. Note 2: in the crop view, the blue and brown fields are under the steep parts of the curve, while the wall and shadows areas are not. The raw histogram makes it obvious that the compression does indeed take place throughout the entire range of possible values: the bottoms of those comb-like jaggies indicate where there are no values at all, whereas the uncompressed image indicates the presence of a relatively continuous range of values. On inspection of the basic images, the differences are far subtler than the histogram might suggest. What I see are smoother gradients and less noise. This was predictable: when the compressed value drops just one increment in one channel while the other channels stay the same, the image processor sees a fairly large change that indicates a meaningful change in the color. Something I did not predict was that continuous lines of moire -- optically inevitable aliases along edges -- are more pronounced due to the increased precision of the uncompressed file. Furthermore, the compressed image appears slightly sharpened; I triple checked that this was not a Rawtherapee setting. Still, the raw compression has visual artifacts that I do not like -- when viewed at 400%. Inspecting the normally processed color images, the differences become yet more subtle. I use the LMMSE (linear minimum mean-square estimation) demosaicing method due to how well it handles aliasing on these anti-alias-filter-free cameras, and LMMSE also removes a lot of the compression-induced aliasing. The compressed image still appears lightly sharpened. Notably, the highest resolution features in the compressed image lose most of their color saturation. My sense is that the compressed image also has slightly more impulse noise, but I learned a lot time ago that comparing noise from two crops like this is absolutely unreliable; true noise is random, so you need a large sample size to get a sense of the actual distribution. My takeaway is that the uncompressed image retains better color fidelity at high resolution, and retains more consistent edge transitions. (Remember, this part of the frame is slightly out of focus.) There's just more magenta in the compressed image.. this might be worth inspecting in relation to high ISO traits. Turning to the final pair, the monochrome images, the difference ... remains about the same. At this point, I'm wondering if the sharpness difference isn't due to change in focus precision between shots. (Perhaps now you see why subscribing to Sean Reid's reviews is money well spent. He has these issues locked down.) But that hypothesis does not explain the unsharp-mask-like behavior that I see: a slight overcompensation to lightness when transitioning from dark to light structures. Regardless, the compressed file still seems to yield a slightly noisier tonal fields and has jaggier aliasing; the highest resolution structures have more consistent contrast in the uncompressed file. Now, the penultimate test: zoom out and see if I notice any differences. At full-screen, roughly the size of my prints, I can tell that there's no need for the ultimate test -- prints. I won't be able to tell them apart. At 100%, though, I'm compelled to say that there is a difference. I haven't found a way to illustrate it, but my impression is that the uncompressed file is more Monochrom-like: it looks less like a crowd of pixels and more like a coherent photo. Of course, I've spent 3 hours with these images and so my psychology training tells me that I'm reliably unreliable at this point: I've made my interpretation and my brain will see those for me whether or not they actually exist. Hopefully I've shown you enough to either recognize it as a non-issue (or obvious issue) for your purposes, or perhaps I've offered an indication of how you can effectively conduct your own tests to make your own determination. But storage is cheap, I shoot slowly, and I can no longer pretend that there's no difference at all between compressed and uncompressed. Crop a bit, draw a steep curve over part of the range, and these issues, which look like moire or chromatic aberration, will start showing up. If I could reduce a lens issue with a larger memory card, I certainly would; that's effectively what's happening here. If I was shooting an event and running into buffer limitations, I'd absolutely start using compressed DNGs: half the size means half the write time. Or, if I needed to conserve space for some reason, the compressed DNGs are still excellent (they've served me well this long!) and far superior to JPGs. But consider me converted: uncompressed from here on. At least until I get a more advanced camera with a reasonably modern (lossless) compression method. --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323261-compressed-vs-uncompressed-m9-dng/?tab=comments#comment-4250223", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "323261-compressed-vs-uncompressed-m9-dng", "result": true, "Selector": "i've made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " over the last 16 months, i have taken almost no photos -- the longest such period for me in decades. i've found my skills are rusty ... the fundamental intentions are there but some of the habits have been lost. so i'm treating my m9 like a new-to-me camera. here's one interesting thing i've found that i wasn't even aware of beforehand: the difference between compressed and uncompressed raw files. background: the m9 offers raw and jpeg formats; raw files can be either compressed or uncompressed. the compressed files are half the size of the uncompressed files, so this is not a data-oriented lossless algorithm (like .zip files) nor a visually oriented lossy algorithm (like .jpg files). my understanding is that the uncompressed values are bit-shifted to fit 8-bit containers, which is a very fast operation for computers to perform (and bit-shifting a 16-bit value to an 8-bit value is mathematically the same as taking a square root). then, when processing the raw file, those 8-bit values are expanded to 16 bits. a raw value of 255 (clipped white) becomes 255^2 = 65,025, a value of 254 becomes 254^2 = 64,516, and so on until a raw value of 2 becomes 4, with 1 and 0 unchanged. thus there are gaps between the possible values that the raw photo processor can interpret, much like tines in a comb: it simply isn't possible for an 8-bit raw value to tell the image processor that the captured value was 3 or 65,026. if you then turn around and output a .jpg file, the image will be re-compressed to 8 bits and the image is, as far as this goes, unchanged. however, if you manipulate the photo, you're theoretically losing out on a fair amount of precision that might cause visible artifacts.

The m9 is not any more or any less likely to suffer an issue than other cameras. It\u2019s just less likely to be repairable due to the age and in particular Leica\u2019s proclivity not to keep an infinite number of spares for their models. the m9 isn\u2019t just the only ff CCD leica, AFAIK it\u2019s the only ff CCD anywhere. So yes in that respect it\u2019s the only gig in town. My 240 will go to wetzlar soon to have some pixels mapped out. I wonder if my m9 needed that work doing what they would say? If I drop my 9 and break the lcd, I wonder if leica still have any to replace it? There\u2019s no reason the m9 WILL have a problem.. but all things CAN have a problem, and a complication with the m9 is the age and lack of support Remember, there\u2019s no m9 sensors left because the supplier stopped making them, first Kodak, then the company that bought out Kodak\u2019s sensor production. So Leica (like many companies) is at the mercy of its suppliers. The risk of any old product that\u2019s out of support needs to be offset by the desire of the buyer to own the product... and that\u2019s a person by person dialogue, whether or not CCD is worth the cost and the risk is up the individual. Where are other parts beet out now rather than just sensors for M9 series. It happened too soon after last M9 series cameras were made in late 2015 and been available for sale via official dealers well into 2016. Not to mention, Leica Camera AG recent double dipping on M9 cameras which were traded in due to sensors failure. Recent transactions under heavy price only to find out what camera is EOL and only solution in need of repair is to allow Leica Camera AG triple dipping and sell replacement for even more than initially was paid for refurb camera. My made in late 2015 M-E 220 went for sensor replacement and I have to wait several months. And no paper work on return. I will use this camera as pleasure toy until it craps out. I don't want to depend on tool which has no local, dependable service. M240 support is unknown. It might be M9 V2 soon. M10 is not impressive on reliability.

Works really great (OP I think the SF20 or SF24 D would be a good choice ) One thing I found a little odd in TTL mode is when using exposure compensation. When I add exposure compensation on the flash unit (let\u2019s say \u201c+ 1\u201d), the metre reading (presumably the distance the flash will cover) goes down. Eg the reading says 1 metre and I add 1/3 stop exp compensation the distance on the read out reduces from 1m to 0.7. I figure it should be going the other way as you increase exposure compensation the coverable distance increases (after all we are trying to make the image brighter ?) Conversely if I go the other way and add negative exposure compensation on the unit, my coverable distance on the flash read out increases. Seems illogical or am I misunderstanding something about exposure compensation When not using compensation the read out changes as I would expect ... eg if I open up the aperture the distance read out increases - makes sense to me.

I suspect this is typical, which is why this sort of discussion is difficult to manage productively. So, that said, I think it might be productive to add: Having film negatives is categorically different -- for me -- from having digital files. I feel a sense of responsibility to make the most of film negatives; I feel a sense of responsibility to prevent the loss of even my poorest digital files. Awareness of this affects my shooting, which affects my methods, which affects the quality of my shots. I don't shoot film these days, but having shot film as a primary tool after having shot digital as a primary tool has affected how I shoot digital as an exclusive tool. If you're not sure of whether the analog workflow matters, but you're still curious, it costs less than a modest M lens to buy a Leica film camera, lens, a handful of rolls of film, their development from a professional service, and reasonable scanner to find out. Even less if you go with a still-excellent kit from a more mainstream brand. And, like the M lens, most of that can be recovered in resale with little loss. Film surpasses digital in terms of resolution. Full stop. I'll be willing to reconsider this opinion when 24x36mm sensors reach 60-80 megapixels. Regardless, the point is not how much detail a medium resolves but how much information it conveys to the viewer. In that case, contrast is king. Photographic engineers have known this since the 1950's, as far as I can tell. And digital files can make contrast arbitrarily large. And film can make resolution almost arbitrarily high. Match made in heaven? Well, no, but perhaps one of the higher purgatories where the engineers who haven't considered existential matters go. Output is ultimate. I love digital printing. Was it Avedon who said something like, \"nothing interesting ever happens in the shadows\"? Nonsense: it is just prohibitively difficult to make interesting things happen in the shadows when making optical prints from a negative. When I can digitally manipulate an image and create a print that can visually discern a luminance value of 0 from 10 as I can from 124 to 134 or from 245 to 255, I can definitely make interesting things happen in the shadows. I adore Piezography, even if mainstream inkjet systems might have caught up over the last few years. Yet, without an appreciation for film prints, I'd always be wanting to make interesting things happen in the shadows: film printing taught me to cultivate the glory of shapes made from nothing but black and very, very dark gray. Process is dispositive, in technical terms. Going from digital camera to digital software to digital printing is extremely predictable, both by the nature of digital technology and by the popularity of its use, meaning you and I can have meaningful discussions about digital methodology even if we've never actually met. Inserting anything \"analog\" into the process adds too many variables to track: a few seconds here or there in development add up, as do a few degrees of temperature, as do a few months of chemical age, as does a minor attitude difference in exposure metering or choice of lens or printing paper. Reciprocity failure is real; physical variance is real. Yet, at the same time, tangible is real: a physical print, to me, is even more different from an electronic image as an analog negative is to a digital one. Your ability to make a superior print from an analog origin is in no way invalidated by someone else's ability to make a relatively superior print from a digital origin; in fact, the latter origin story is more typical because it requires less skill. Process is dispositive, in personal terms. Was is Weston who said something like, \"I go into the darkroom in the morning with a handful of strips of negatives, a ream of unexposed photo paper, and a bottle of scotch; and I come out in the afternoon with one or two prints and a grin\"? That, I can relate to. There is absolutely no profit in treating art as business. A thing can be both, but not simultaneously. If you are doing it for art, you are doing it for what works for you: the internet be damned. If you are doing it for business, you are doing it for the nickels and dimes: the internet be blessed. If you're in the latter category, you should never pay me any attention. If you're in the former, you should only mind your soul. Sometimes process means everything: slowly capture images on a low speed, black and white film, make high quality straight prints of modest magnification therefrom; perhaps scan and digitally adjust that print, print to a digital negative, and make a final contact print therefrom. Sometimes process means nothing: casually snap shots and send the out-of-camera JPEG straight to the internet. Both approaches are perfectly valid, as is every method in between. A 600 square foot apartment is tiny? Bah. That's huge compared to where I live (though, admittedly, I haven't made optical prints here). Expensive? Bah. My daily kit cost me more than a year's worth of housing, utilities, and commuting expenses. If you think whatever reason is enough to rule something in or out, that's fine, but that applies to your life, not mine; more importantly, the inverse is equally true. Find your priorities. Own them. There has never, ever been a more favorable time to pick your own path, no matter your ambition or where you're starting from.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323361-is-it-worth-buying-analogue-in-2021/page/7/?tab=comments#comment-4263774", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "323361-is-it-worth-buying-analogue-in-2021", "result": true, "Selector": "i can definitely make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " this discussion has triggered many of my pet peeves. i suspect this is typical, which is why this sort of discussion is difficult to manage productively. so, that said, i think it might be productive to add: having film negatives is categorically different -- for me -- from having digital files. i feel a sense of responsibility to make the most of film negatives; i feel a sense of responsibility to prevent the loss of even my poorest digital files. awareness of this affects my shooting, which affects my methods, which affects the quality of my shots. i don't shoot film these days, but having shot film as a primary tool after having shot digital as a primary tool has affected how i shoot digital as an exclusive tool. if you're not sure of whether the analog workflow matters, but you're still curious, it costs less than a modest m lens to buy a leica film camera, lens, a handful of rolls of film, their development from a professional service, and reasonable scanner to find out. even less if you go with a still-excellent kit from a more mainstream brand. and, like the m lens, most of that can be recovered in resale with little loss. film surpasses digital in terms of resolution. full stop. i'll be willing to reconsider this opinion when 24x36mm sensors reach 60-80 megapixels. regardless, the point is not how much detail a medium resolves but how much information it conveys to the viewer. in that case, contrast is king. photographic engineers have known this since the 1950's, as far as i can tell. and digital files can make contrast arbitrarily large. and film can make resolution almost arbitrarily high. match made in heaven?

that, i can relate to. there is absolutely no profit in treating art as business. a thing can be both, but not simultaneously. if you are doing it for art, you are doing it for what works for you: the internet be damned. if you are doing it for business, you are doing it for the nickels and dimes: the internet be blessed. if you're in the latter category, you should never pay me any attention. if you're in the former, you should only mind your soul. sometimes process means everything: slowly capture images on a low speed, black and white film, make high quality straight prints of modest magnification therefrom; perhaps scan and digitally adjust that print, print to a digital negative, and make a final contact print therefrom. sometimes process means nothing: casually snap shots and send the out-of-camera jpeg straight to the internet. both approaches are perfectly valid, as is every method in between. a 600 square foot apartment is tiny? bah. that's huge compared to where i live (though, admittedly, i haven't made optical prints here). expensive? bah. my daily kit cost me more than a year's worth of housing, utilities, and commuting expenses. if you think whatever reason is enough to rule something in or out, that's fine, but that applies to your life, not mine; more importantly, the inverse is equally true. find your priorities. own them. there has never, ever been a more favorable time to pick your own path, no matter your ambition or where you're starting from.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 886, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Giguchan", "date": "2021-10-03 04:12:00", "content": "Hello Good People, I wanted to mention that i made the decision and purchased the 35mm Summilux.

I'm not rich, and I've mostly used my older lens on my M10, and have continued to buy older lenses such as my TeleElmar 135. Then I dug out my M3 and gradually started shooting film again. I love the results, as long as I don't go into \"comparisons\". Anyway, I rarely shoot at f/2 unless doing so on purpose for blurring the background. Most of my photos are around f/5.6 or f/8. With the M10 if it's bright and sunny, I usually have the ISO at 100 or 200. I rarely go much over ISO 800. 8 hours ago, Mute-on said: Mike, do yourself a favour and don\u2019t buy into the pixel peeping, APO justifying BS that only really emerged with digital. All M mount Leica lenses will produce acceptably sharp images on film (for non-scientific purposes, more or less). I hardly ever did that, until/unless I wanted specifically to create a large image where I wanted all the detail I could get. My M8.2 was still excellent, unless I zoomed in way too much. When I did comparisons, it was better than the Nikons I was using at that time. Now the M10 with 24 megapixels has more than enough of those pixels that I don't feel any urge to upgrade to a newer model Leica with more. Again, if I'm trying to see a huge image, I prefer my Summicron to my Nikon lenses (all older models too). Having written all that, I don't really worry too much about it. The results I am creating with my M10 and my older lenses are more than enough for anything I want to do. As for detail, when I take a photo of the Miami skyline with me standing on my balcony on Miami Beach, unless I view at 100% I don't begin to see any lack of detail - and I figure if I want more detail, I should get a large format camera. .....but, when I try this with my film cameras, I feel my resolution is limited by the film I'm using, which lately has been 400 ASA Ilford. I expect I will go back to 100 ASA Ilford (or whatever) unless I need the higher speed. But the bottom line, if I compare images taken with my M10 with the best film images I can capture with my M3, or M2, that ultra-clarity is no longer there..... which most of the time doesn't matter, as to me, the images from film often look more pleasing than the images from digital.

Especially if you look at those JPEGs made with the M10 on a 23\" monitor. If it's anything I care about, I only shoot in RAW, use PhotoMechanic to get my images onto my computer, use DxO PhotoLab4 for processing, and view my images on a 27\" calibrated ASUS monitor.

My M2 needs a visit to DAG even more than my M3, but I'll do one at a time.

Hello, I think going below 60 is fully fine if your subject is not moving. You can also open up your lens. I do not hesitate to shoot at 1/15 when I have to but I'd usually open up the lens before getting there. Which lens are you using? Hope this helps!

I understand your question. I'm no expert but I'll offer this suggestion. I suggest you find a couple of articles describing the relationship between ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. Then find a couple of articles on the Sunny 16 Rule. That rule says if you use ISO 200, you can set your shutter speed at 1/250 (closest speed to ISO 200) and set your aperture at f16 and you will nearly always get a good exposure on a subject in direct full sunlight. The exposure equivalents are 1/500 at f11 and 1/1000 and f8. You can't get to f5.6 because there is no 1/2000 on a film M. There are some darkroom tricks and use of neutral density filters. Let's not go there until you are confident with the Sunny 16 and exposure equivalent concept.

Try it to see which you are, because it's fun and you pay far more attention to light, shade, contrast, etc. than you do if you have a meter in your hand. Problem with the cell phone light meter app is that when you forget to close the app (and you will!), that'll burn your battery, because it's using your camera. So, get a small meter, if you want to go that way. I use Sunny 16 during the summer months, when there is a long, high sun, and tend not to use it as much in the winter, when the sun is low and light is far more complicated. But most B&W films have a pretty wide latitude, and the great thing about film is that the \"mistakes\" are often the real gems. I agree regarding cellphones and battery, I also found that the free mater apps are less accurate than a decent external meter.

So when he dogs the 35 Cron it is 1) in that context and 2) relative to its peers. e.g. \"If you care about the same stuff I do..\" That paraphrased comparison does not exist in a vacuum, it's extremely context-dependent. Quote I haven't really used either of these lenses, but there are various possible answers: First of all Leica R10's answer above Which basically means \"I like using it and I get good pictures\" the two sides may or may not be linked. This, too, is very specifically and exactly covered in the post to which you're responding: \"If someone said they want the 35 Cron just because they like the brand, or the way it draws, or enjoy its flaws, etc. I don't expect he'd have any grievance.\" I feel the same way described, and also have no grievance over what people like or why. Quote How do you define 'superior optics' . . . well, it would appear to be because it has good MTF and sharpness in a controlled test setup. It's going to be defined by the author, for the author's stated or implied context. Given optics rather than preferences, it should be objectively demonstrated and repeatable. Quote But it really doesn't (at all) reflect LeicaR10's remarks about it being 'all about the photograph'. But worse than that - Lloyd as you said is complimentary about the 18/20/24 SEM lenses and most people would subscribe to that, but when I had the 24, I tested considerably at 20 metres and found it to be very soft at the corners - Leica confirmed it was 'within spec' Most testers wouldn't test a lens at that distance (too complicated to organise properly and repeatably). The 24 SEM was originally reviewed by him 11 years ago, and relative to the available options of that day. One quote of note from it: \"Finally, it also shows that MTF by itself is almost silly: the results depend far more on the particular image than on absolute MTF. MTF is a good starting point for understanding performance characteristics, but real images teach a lot more.\" For one of many notes about the edges, \"The outer edge area is visibly less crisp than the right side of the crop, showing that the 24/3.8 does decline to the edges\" with the context that the lens still blew away most DSLR lenses of the day. He has retested it more times over the years. From a retest earlier this year on the M10-M: \"Wide open at f/3.8, outer zones are somewhat blurry; the lens cannot make a sharp image outside the central 2/3 or so of the frame. A good deal of the dropoff in performance is probably the direct result of ray angle degradation and not optical per se\u2014even though Leica M lenses are at their best on M cameras, they still suffer from digital sensor application and this is true going way back to the M9\u2014the 40MP sensor just make it more obvious. Stopping down to f/5.6 greatly improves performance to the edges, but corner areas even in the distance are still less than optimal.\" More edge criticism on a more demanding camera, but given in fairness to sensor issues. And it was I'll leave it to you to decide to pay to see it all, but if it is the point to imply that the edges were missed - they certainly weren't, and it was tested on a wide amount of subject and focus distances. Quote Me? Well, you might be surprised to hear that I really do a lot of testing - and much of it as near to infinity as possible (where the rear element is closest to the sensor and most edge troubles will occur). But I don't publish it much because I think it's very difficult to read properly (and rather boring as well). I use it to inform my opinion about something . . . but what I'm really interested in is how the image actually looks - and that's a function of lots of things you can't really measure I am not the least bit surprised. And they're your articles, so you certainly can and should do with them as you please. As I said, I enjoy them too! Quote What I try to do in my articles, rather than a severe technical approach is to give a proper feel for how a lens will look (draw if you like) and I do that by shooting at different apertures and different distances - then, hopefully the reader can draw their own conclusions. That is how I take Lloyd's reviews too. They are images, images, images. More images, then some more images. Mostly beautiful landscapes displayed in full with later zoom analysis at all usable apertures, which the reader may read or not, and heed or not, according to their interests. This is not \"severe\" to me, but I'm reminded of it happening in pretty much all subject matters that anyone who cares more about a given thing is judged as obsessed, and that anyone who cares less is judged as undiscriminating. Quote There isn't a right way of doing this, but back to the Leica35/2 vs the Zeiss 35/2 - I don't doubt Lloyds results, but I question whether they have much relevance to which lens you actually decide to get. They have tremendous relevance for me, because I would rather \"outsource\" excellence to those who clearly know and care about it much more than I do. I do know that I want my images to be unsurprising representations of the reality I saw through my viewfinder, and to survive the inevitable progress of monitor sizes and resolution where I do most of my viewing. This is how I make most product decisions: find someone who knows and cares more but in the same direction as me, and heavily consider their advice.

I also had a 35mm 1.4 ASPH at the time, and it was just a better, faster lens. But the angle of view of the 40mm is lovely, as was the size. I am also spoiled by having had a Mamiya 7II and 80mm since 2002, and in that time I have taken many of my favorite photos with that combination. It is a true goldilocks combination, especially on 6x7, where the shallower depth of field allows for a bit more separation from the background as needed, but not so much as to make full DOF photos difficult. The Plaubel has that extra stop, which is oh so lovely. I am attaching a photo I made of my friend about ten years ago with a Plaubel and its 80mm Nikkor. Meanwhile, I just recently got the GRIIIx for exactly this reason. I love the focal length and it makes the ideal compact snapshot camera. The quick photos from it are really appealing.

Is everyone having the some experience? Thats actually not how I would describe the lens. It is sharp enough wide open and if you have a chance to review John Buckley's sample images here on the forum you can see that even wide open the focus point is sharp. As compared to my E58 F1 Noctilux I find the new 1.2 a little sharper but without as much aberrations in the out of focus areas, and in general all shots at 1.2 feel creative and really quite lovely. I only had a chance to take a few direct comparisons against my Dad's original 1968 1.2 and they do render a bit differently and in fact it is the original that I feel better fits Jono's description. Then at F2 this new iteration diverges from the original design and is far far sharper with most measurable performance aspects being better than the original. So far I feel like this is two lenses in one, wide open it is close the original 1.2 and offers a creative platform to play with, then from F2 on up it is much more of a modern lens which for me makes for a versatile all around 50mm focal length. It is also extremely well made, better than any other modern alloy barrel Leica lens with a solid general feel, perfect aperture clicks and beautifully smooth focus.

You can use it without a hood without reservations Exactly what I wanted to hear, thank you! 8 hours ago, IkarusJohn said: The 50 Summilux-M ASPH was designed in the Koelsch era - before Peter Karbe took over as head of lens design, though I seem to recall that Peter Karbe had a part in designing the 50 Summilux ASPH. I have both the silver chrome 50 Summillux ASPH and the black chrome 50 APO Summicron. There\u2019s no need to comment on the rendering, as this is well covered elsewhere, other than to say the first versions of the APO had flare problems (since fixed) and I have had no problem of flare with the Summillux. With the Summilux, I tend to extract the built in hood for lens protection as much as anything else. I use that lens most on my Monochrom, with a yellow filter living on it. The lens is smooth as butter to focus with the focus tab, despite the slight stiffness the FLE gives at close focus. I found that working the focus tab as I sat and watched TV helped to smooth it out. It was certainly a little stiff when new. With the APO, the lens hood looks great, but it is a bit of a pain (same with the 35 Summilux-M pre-asph). You have to take the lens hood off to put the lens cap on, which means the hood is kicking around in your bag when you\u2019re not using it. I find I leave the lens cap on my desk, and rely on the lens hood to protect the front element when I\u2019m not using the lens (not ideal). However, I like to use hoods, so there we are. The 1960s look and feel of the black chrome lens is lovely, and focusing takes a little getting used to (no different from other tabless lenses - the 21 Summilux, the 28 Summaron, Noctilux 0.95 and 75 Summillux). I like the scalloped focusing ring in use. I just find I have to return the focus to infinity, so I know where I\u2019m starting from. If it were me, I\u2019d go for the black chrome version - they look fabulous \u2026 Interesting little bit of history there, I was (incorrectly) under the assumption that it was a modern lens. I now see that it's a remnant of the film era, perhaps why it looks to render a little bit friendlier than the other ASPH lenses that I've always strayed away from. I'm also a 'lens cap at home, protective filter on the lens' type of person and do like the idea of the extra protection from the hood too, but the truth is that I don't take my camera everywhere and I'm usually pretty carefulish. I also prefer a focus tab in general use (though my current v5 Cron doesn't have one) but I have a much stronger emotional connection to (pictures on the internet of) the black chrome and that's a huge part of the reason I shoot Leica! I think I have probably made up my mind at this point. Thanks! 8 hours ago, evikne said: OK, so you mean the Black Chrome version, that wasn't clear until your last paragraph.

That's is precisely the reason I left it out of the equation: size and weight. Somewhere between the Nokton 1.4 and the CV 3.5. . A little/huge update: Considering my switch to mirrorless probably at the beginning of the following year, I had to reconsider the budget for the camera and lenses for everything. It is a considerable investment; one needs everything new: camera, lenses, batteries, fast cards. Regarding the SEM or no SEM question, I probably made a decision. I believe it should be interesting to get \"just\" a CV 21/3.5 and start to play around (for the first time with M) with the 21FL. I decided to not buy an external VF; I want to guesstimate the feel of the whole OVF. And the time will tell. If it works well, it's a keeper. If I find the 21FL fascinating on M (as it is for me, the 35FL), I would probably add the SEM in the future. In fall, I decided I'll buy these three brand new Voigtlander lenses, in no particular order: 35/2 Ultron II 21/35 Asph 50/1.5 II In the end, I have the curiosity to try lenses such a CV 21/1.4, the SEM, the CV 35/2 APO. But they all are big lenses, and I identify myself in the \"small size and weight\" shooting enjoyment. So no GAS if it's possible and buy what I will surely like and use. There are many terrific FL to shoot with an M camera: frame liens, external VF, guesstimates. There are all excellent ways to play and be happy with. But I firmly believe that 35 and 50 are the best-optimized-smart FL choices to shoot with an M camera. But this is another topic. Now, I'm betting on the 21-35-50 lens kit. There is more. I always liked the idea of a monochrome camera. I used to convert many photos in BW, and for years I was shooting in raw monochrome. Then I found the M10 and started to appreciate the color again. But I still visualize many scenes in real life that have great potential for BW imagery. I have experience with that, and it feels excellent. For example, I can't imagine how awesome it would be to see BW preview in an EVF. That's why the Q2M is whispering a lot in my mind in the last months. And I decided to keep my mouth shut.

If so, on what do you base that conclusion. Have you read that somewhere? I would maintain that it was designed to allow an image to be made in low light and the bokeh was a secondary concern. Are you saying the Lux was not designed for superb rendering wide open? That is absurd. Is the aperture opening of the Lux still perfectly round at f/2? No, its shape is less than optimal from a rendering standpoint, so yes, the Lux is at a disadvantage when compared against a native f/2 lens in that context. And of course shooting at f/1.4 is not the only thing the lens was designed to do. I stop mine down all day long, but not when I want the best character/rendering. Have you listened to Peter Karbe talk about using these APO lenses (The 50 Lux is APO but unlabeled as such)? He says always shoot wide open. I know that statement is directed more at the 35/50 APOs, but it does give you a look into his thought process. 2 hours ago, fotografr said: My purpose in doing the comparison was not to determine which lens produced the most pleasing OOF area. It was more a test to see how sharpness, contrast and transition to OOF of the Voigtlander Heliar stacked up against a known high performer of the same focal length in the Leica lineup. I said characterful rendering, which includes all those things plus vignetting. I could also make the point that stopping down the Lux to f/2 is putting the Heliar at a disadvantage since the Lux contrast and sharpness are boosted at f/2. So while your comparison IS an interesting comparison \u2013 IMO it's not very meaningful. That's all. And it really has less to do with your comparison itself, which is why I didn't quote you.

Hello JD, I used to think that it was difficult to compare Dollars then to Dollars now, or Dollars at another time because I used to use things like official inflation rates, median incomes & the like. When things didn't seem to coalesce I stopped using them & I invented my own system. Your choice of \"median income\" in 1970 & now is interesting because it fits right in: 1970 was at the beginning of the \"big inflation\" which came about because the money printed to pay for the war in Vietnam was beginning to be worked into the economy but it hadn't damaged the economy that much yet. So: If you take your $9,870 in 1970 Dollars & multiply it by 12 you get $118,440. If you divide $67,521 by $118,440 you get 57% in round numbers. Keeping in mind that this is the number Nationally & in some parts of the Country the actual percentage may vary 1 way or the other for a variety of reasons. 57% reads about right for me: If you use the criteria of: How long did you work & after you subtract all taxes, medical care, educational costs, housing costs, electricity & other FIXED & NECESSARY costs: What do you have to show for it? If you look at the house on the street that the average person grew up on: When many people were growing up: 1 person went out to work a 40 hour week unless they wanted something extra. Then they would work overtime. The other person would stay at home & often work just as hard raising a family & keeping a home. Today, in that same home on that same street: 1 person will work full time. The other person will most likely work part time or full time & their children will spend a good portion of time in day care, pre-school, or the like. They will spend less time being a family, or part of a family with 1 adult at home with the children together. And once they subtract the FIXED & NECESSARY costs I listed above: They will have less left over income to do other things with as a family together. Adjusting for the current value of the money compared with what it would have bought in 1970.

All of them have had at least one major re-design, and nominally perform better (sometimes a lot better). In a mixed analogy, a Ford F-150 pickup base price in 1973 was $US 2889 - today the base price is $US 26940 (or 9.32 times as much). But again, it is not the same product (by a long shot) that was sold in 1970. One gets more for one's money. https://www.thedrive.com/news/34333/heres-how-much-the-ford-f-150-has-increased-in-price-over-the-decades 2) Leica's \"business currency\" (in which they calculate expenses, most salaries, profit and loss) has changed from Deutsche Marks in 1970 to the Euro today. Leica prices their gear in Euros, at a rate that will produce a profit in Euros. Then converts that to equivalent amounts in other currencies (at rates which change daily) To really calculate Leica's pricing consistently (avoiding the ups and downs of other countries' economies) one would need to do it in DM/Euros from 1970. https://www.statista.com/statistics/412794/euro-to-u-s-dollar-annual-average-exchange-rate/ 3) In 2004, Leica nearly went bankrupt. A pretty good indication that they were not charging enough for their products, at that time, to cover expenses. Dr. Kaufmann has been vigilant in making sure Leica doesn't fall into that trap again - mostly by raising the gear prices from time to time (and disposing of the least-profitable products - e.g. the R system). Hello Andy, If I could make a few small adjustments please: In 1970 dollars, when most M4's & all of the 3 lenses would have been made in Wetzlar. Keeping in mind that there had been at least 100 M4's made in Midland at that time: So, the value of the camera & the lenses would most likely have been determined in Deutsch Marks. When Deutsch Marks, if I remember correctly, were around 4 to a USofA Dollar. Which is 1 of the things that made things, like cars, from Germany such a good deal back then. And, if I also remember correctly: The value of a Canadian Dollar in USofA Dollars was about 1.00 Canadian Dollar to $1.10 in USofA Dollars. Today it is approximately 1.25 Canadian Dollars to 1.00 USofA Dollar. So, that would make the 399 Canadian Dollars for an M4 & a 50mm f2 Summicron be approximately $440 USofA Dollars back then. Which means 1,760 Deutsch Marks back then. Now we need to know the relationship of Deutsch Marks to Euros AT THE TIME WHEN THE DEUTSCH MARK TO EURO RATE WAS FIXED. Because that is the \"store of value\" that we have to work with. Then we can adjust those Euros to Euros now & then change those Euros back to Canadian Dollars today. Does anyone out there know the exchange rate & date when Deutsch Marks were fixed to Euros for the conversion?

You know better than that! A floating element is for correcting close-up performance (at any aperture) - it compensates for the differing mathematics of parallel (near effective infinity) and diverging (close-up) light rays. It has nothing to do with correcting focus shift. Focus shift is caused by different bundles of light rays predominating as one stops down to different apertures and eliminates the outer ones. Has nothing to do with a floating element. Although a myth to that effect has grown up around the 35 Summilux FLE - but it is just a fan-boy myth. What Leica actually says is: Page one, paragraph one: http://www.summilux.net/m_system/images/Summilux35Asph-2010.pdf No mention of focus shift whatsoever. What fixes focus shift is taming spherical aberration by way of different glass or different curvatures (see: C/V Nokton 35mm f/1.4 version II. A new non-floating glass element, but not a floating element in sight ). I made this definition of FLE that might explain it. Feel free to comment on it as there may be details I didn't get right. (Also @01af if you want to join in here) Floating Elements (FLE) = Near focus correction in a lens by having a single lens or a group of lenses floating independently of the other lenses. Most lenses are born with poor performance at their closest focusing distance. Center sharpness may be good, but aberrations and corner softness increase when you\u2019re shooting closeups. Floating elements are lens elements outside of the primary focus group that change position when the lens is focused on a close object, correcting aberrations and improving close up performance. Floating Elements originally was coined by Canon in the 1960's and quickly became the general term for this feature. Other brands came up with new names for the same thing, Minolta called it Floating Focusing, Nikon used the term Close-Range Correction (CRC), Leica call it FLE/Floating Elements. Floating elements are for close-focus improvement of image quality and not for reducing \"focus shift\". Floating elements by themselves cannot reduce focus shift, but by reducing the impact of focus distance on performance, they give the designers more freedom in other areas - which could include minimizing focus shift. (As a side-note, when a lens \"rattle\" when moved, it is not the floating elements \"floating around\" but can be the IS (Image Stabilization) elements for elense that has that, AF elements for auto focus lenses, or the aperture cage that rattles (as in the case of the Leica 35mm Summilux-M f/1.4 FLE - if you stop down the Summilux to f/16, the sound is usually not there). --img--  Edited February 3 by Overgaard", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317411-review-leica-noctilux-50mm-f12/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-4132462", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "317411-review-leica-noctilux-50mm-f12", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "on 2/1/2021 at 11:22 pm, adan said: jono, jono, jono! you know better than that! a floating element is for correcting close-up performance (at any aperture) - it compensates for the differing mathematics of parallel (near effective infinity) and diverging (close-up) light rays. it has nothing to do with correcting focus shift. focus shift is caused by different bundles of light rays predominating as one stops down to different apertures and eliminates the outer ones. has nothing to do with a floating element. although a myth to that effect has grown up around the 35 summilux fle - but it is just a fan-boy myth. what leica actually says is: page one, paragraph one: http://www.summilux.net/m_system/images/summilux35asph-2010.pdf no mention of focus shift whatsoever. what fixes focus shift is taming spherical aberration by way of different glass or different curvatures (see: c/v nokton 35mm f/1.4 version ii. a new non-floating glass element, but not a floating element in sight ). -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  this definition of fle that might explain it. feel free to comment on it as there may be details i didn't get right.

I spoke with Leica NJ about this after I got it and asked them to clarify with Wetzlar. Dear Leica Customer, The lens hood is modeled after the original design from the 50s to be as historically correct as possible. For this reason, the lens hood can be rotated and is not fixed in any particular position. We cannot change anything about it Well, that I can be rotated makes totally sense as all hoods at that time were round. But I am sure that professional photographers who were probably the initial purchasers of the famous Nocti 1.2 would have lost confidence in Leica after loosing the hoods. At that era I think Leica was known to have an ear for their customers\u2019 needs. The reply from Wetzlar on the description of the situation was that the hood should be fixed strong enough so that ist is possible to pick up the camera on the hood. They did not tell me \u201csalads\u201d but they did not deliver me a better hood, too. I can hardly accept that after purchasing one of the world\u2019s most expensive lenses, the manufacturer does not provide a solution if something has gone wrong. The quality system has failed at several stages wir the production of this lens. And relaunching a historic lens does not mean to report dice eventual weaknesses. They don\u2019t grind the aspherical by hand any more now. Abs I suspect that the optical performance of the re-edition is more consistent and higher in average it the produced batch batch. In addition I would have strongly appreciated if the hood would e.g. modified in the way to snap it in the lens in the adverse sense for transporting the camera in the pouch, as they did later with most of the clip-on hoods.

Thank you for a very sore respons As you say the lenses i have are most likely great each in their own right. I know from reading reviews that they should be great lenses. To fill in some of the blanks of what my motivation and preference usually is when it comes to FL and IQ in general. Im a Nikon shooter at base, and always shot with it both manual and analogue. And the body and lenses i tend to gravitate there are usually feeling and character more than sharpness and technically amazing. Lenses like the Noct which i have owned, or the imitation in 58 G or the 105 f1,4 G are all lenses with character rather than the perfect optical formula for sharpness etc. Also i favor the Nikon DF forts feeling and character rather than the newest and greatest. Have a score of nice manual Nikkors and even there i favor the lenses bringing more character. As far as FL go i think my favorite has been 24 or 28 and then either a weird fl like a 58 or 55 rather than 50 to be honest, at least on my Nikons. otherwise 105 has been a favorite on the longer side. However shooting street i have veered towards more Leica like FLs like the 50 and 28-35 mostly. Or even 40. I love shooting my Rollei 35s both with their character and FLs.

Any thoughts to help push me one way or the other are appreciated! Thanks Peter I had a Q2 twice. While I loved the camera and the way it rendered images, I never accepted inside me to have such poor AF performance on such an expensive camera, so it led me to sell it twice. Missing the the 28 focal length, I bought the 28 Lux and discovered one of my favourite lenses of all times. I love it on film, I love it on my M10R, but where I use it the most in on my SL2S. It rendered very differently to the Q2, and in my opinion it's much nicer. At 1.4, it creates a sort of cinematic atmosphere that is very different from the hyper realistic 3D pop look of the Q2. I always say that it's my only modern lens that has as much character as my vintage lenses. I just love how it paints wide open. The images capture light like a movie. To fill the gap with my Q2, I also bought the Ricoh GRIII which never ceases to amaze me. I find the AF to be better than the Q2. In terms of images, I think that for street photography, in 80% of the situations, a non trained eye will not tell the difference between the two. Where the Q2 shines over the Ricoh is for portraits, and close range people shot. But the Ricoh still takes nice photos. I also find the Ricoh to be an excellent camera for Black and White conversions. I never miss my Q2, although I think it's a superb camera. I usually tell people who ask advice on lenses that it's a subjective decision, but when it comes to the Lux 28, unless you are uncomfortable with it's big size (relatively speaking. On an M, it feel big, but on an SL, it's just perfect), I don't think that you can not love it. You can only fall in love with this lens, and I confidently recommend it to you.

For example, when I cross into or out of direct sunlight, I'm adjusting exposure. Similarly, I might read focus for subjects on the other side of the street, make a mental note of the focus position, and keep it there until I see something more specific; then I might see a crowded restaurant entrance and focus on that, then slowly pull focus as I approach, then revert to the across-the-street distance after passing by. I do prefer tabs, though. When I'm shooting regularly -- not the past 18 months -- I find the lens is sometimes focused without any conscious action on my part before the viewfinder reaches my eye. Because I normally shoot tabbed lenses wider than 50, I'd strongly prefer a tabbed 50; fortunately, this group includes some splendid options, such as the Summilux Asph and Summarit 2.4 or 2.5. If I had a non-tabbed Summicron, I'd most likely buy or make something like that \"taab\" thingajiggy. But 50 and longer definitely require more precision than a 35, and a knurled ring gripped with fingertips is about the most precise human-machine interface, so there's good reason that tabs aren't ubiquitous. (For precision, I grip the tab between thumb and forefinger.) For precision while shooting street, well, (a) feel free to try but don't expect much and (b) continuously watch for good targets to focus on because chances are your subject won't be an ideal focusing pattern ... and because good focus targets have high contrast edges, which in turn are great for image composition. [Editorial comment: here begins a rant. My apologies for taking tangents which are already familiar to folks here. I'm planning to sit on a grand jury for a month so I've wound down most of my projects and my stir-craziness is manifesting in writing about photography and associated gear.] If the Fuji meets your needs -- your methods and priorities -- keep using it. Better photographers make better photos, and using the same gear consistently and repeatedly allows the technical stuff to become automatic so that you can focus on becoming a better photographer. Fuji makes some splendid tools; they won't hold you back unless you're trying to do something they're not good at, and they're good at a very wide range of things. For instance, I set my Fuji to manual focus but use a focus-lock button to trigger an AF cycle instead of twisting the focus ring. Conversely, Leica M is good at a very narrow range of things. Within that range, they're amazing; even borderline near the edge of that range, though, they can be quite maddening. The way I prefer to shoot is squarely centered within the M wheelhouse. I think of it like a well-trained but energetic dog: mention a command and the job is done before you know it, but say nothing and you'll start finding bits of your stuff shredded and ripped. To my mind, chimping is antithetical to street shooting. Reviewing means looking at what's already happened, which breaks the flow/mindfulness I need to shoot productively. Chimping can also be a safety issue for me because I wander into traffic.* If I get something wrong, then I got it wrong, no big deal; but if I investigate whether I got something wrong or whether I could have done it better, then I'm in an analytical/editorial headspace, not the perceptive/creative mindset that I cultivate. Actually, if I get something wrong, that's wonderful. Mistakes are fantastic because they give me a clear, distinct opportunity to learn. If I make the same mistake multiple times in an outing, so much the better. Then, in the leisure of my home or hotel, I can study the mistake, find a tentative solution; then I can practice that method, and if it works, develop it into a habit so that I unconsciously avoid that problem in the future. Mistakes are beautiful things. Make them. Make them hard enough that you'll learn from them, make them fast enough that you'll move on quickly. Don't try to avoid them. Instead, figure out what you want, figure out how to achieve that, then set it up so that'll happen when you next press the shutter. I don't want an M-D, though. Having the opportunity to chimp is amazing. Tricky exposure can be nailed down very quickly with a histogram...but that's not image review, that's anticipating what sort of light I'll want to capture in the present environment. On the other hand, when I know something's off, I can stop shooting and practice and learn in that exact environment. Then, auto-review on every shot provides instant feedback: did I use that technique successfully? But I'm honest with myself: at that time, I'm no longer a photographer but a student; I ignore opportunities but seek practice drills. Otherwise... well, if you absolutely, positively must get this shot, then bracketing and bursting is far faster and more reliable than chimping, considering, modifying, and re-shooting. Chimping is like working in a minimalist studio, and that sort of shooting really benefits from working in a real studio, tethered to a computer with the photo processing tools that you'll be using later on. Actually, if I shot portraits, I'd chimp a ton -- not to look at the photos but as a bit of theater to make the sitter relax while I fiddle with my gear until we get to the \"real\" shots, which I'd be taking all the while, but that's not really chimping, only acting.

(for precision, i grip the tab between thumb and forefinger.) for precision while shooting street, well, (a) feel free to try but don't expect much and (b) continuously watch for good targets to focus on because chances are your subject won't be an ideal focusing pattern ... and because good focus targets have high contrast edges, which in turn are great for image composition.

Better photographers make better photos, and using the same gear consistently and repeatedly allows the technical stuff to become automatic so that you can focus on becoming a better photographer. Fuji makes some splendid tools; they won't hold you back unless you're trying to do something they're not good at, and they're good at a very wide range of things. For instance, I set my Fuji to manual focus but use a focus-lock button to trigger an AF cycle instead of twisting the focus ring. Conversely, Leica M is good at a very narrow range of things. Within that range, they're amazing; even borderline near the edge of that range, though, they can be quite maddening. The way I prefer to shoot is squarely centered within the M wheelhouse. I think of it like a well-trained but energetic dog: mention a command and the job is done before you know it, but say nothing and you'll start finding bits of your stuff shredded and ripped. To my mind, chimping is antithetical to street shooting. Reviewing means looking at what's already happened, which breaks the flow/mindfulness I need to shoot productively. Chimping can also be a safety issue for me because I wander into traffic.* If I get something wrong, then I got it wrong, no big deal; but if I investigate whether I got something wrong or whether I could have done it better, then I'm in an analytical/editorial headspace, not the perceptive/creative mindset that I cultivate. Actually, if I get something wrong, that's wonderful. Mistakes are fantastic because they give me a clear, distinct opportunity to learn. If I make the same mistake multiple times in an outing, so much the better. Then, in the leisure of my home or hotel, I can study the mistake, find a tentative solution; then I can practice that method, and if it works, develop it into a habit so that I unconsciously avoid that problem in the future....... I love the way you took a lot of thoughts buzzing around my head, and put them into words that anyone can understand. Thank you!! The tab - I think that's why I preferred using the 35 instead of the 50, and once I get used to the \"position\" of the tab, and a distance, I'll be all set. As it was, I looked at the distance scale, and picked something that seemed appropriate. It should have been (but wasn't) obvious that once I learn this, I can set the focus just by moving the tab to an appropriate place. Fuji and Leica, for me, so similar, but I use them very differently. The Leica is always a challenge for me. The Fuji already knows what it wants to do, so most of what I deal with is composition. I'm proud of what I get from my Leica because I had to \"do\" everything, but the Fuji leaves me free to concentrate on what's most important. That article I linked to about the Fuji is something I found very interesting, and it gave me some insights on how to better use my Leica. It's all a learning experience. The Leica and Fuji are similar, and completely different from my DSLR gear. And sticking with just the Leica and Fuji, the Fuji \"cheats\" in ways that work out beautifully. I'll post just one image below from today's session with the Fuji. Not only did the Fuji automatically focus on a \"right eye\", it automatically fired the flash just enough to make the girl's skin tones better. Had I shot this with my Leica, knowing what I know now, and with no extra equipment, I doubt this photo would have come out so nice. All I had to worry about was timing and composition. I still prefer to use my Leica, but everything Ken Rockwell wrote about the Fuji was true - it does a gazillion things automatically that improve my photos. I'm much more \"proud\" of my good Leica photos, because the Leica allowed me to do what was needed. On the other hand, the Fuji just \"does them\". Thanks for what you posted.

You shouldn't. I agree with you wholeheartedly. It's good to know how lenses perform objectively, but it's also good to know that the effects on the final image with regards to impact and appreciation are marginal or non-existent. I'm not talking about which focal length you use or what aperture, which obviously changes the image substantially. I'm talking same focal length, same aperture, but this vs that brand or this vs that version. Appreciating lenses is fine. I got into photography almost by accident, as a side project project in Uni (I studied mathematics), that was about differential equations of higher order and their applications. It just so happened that my \"case study\" was optical systems and raytracing with regards to lens design, i.e. how optical aberrations work and what kind of equations you solve, usually numerically, to perform aberration correction and optimisation. So I do have great appreciation and understanding for the technical side of it, as well as the hard and ingenious work of the very bright optical designers. But it's a different thing to delude myself that any lens or film made in the last 30 years will make or break a photo. I have seen exhibitions and prints and I have shown some of my own to people, many of them hobbyist photographers. When asked about which photos stood out to them from an \"image quality\" perspective, the large format ones would be picked consistently over 35mm, the medium format ones (6x6, 6x9) half of the time, but between different lenses on the same 35mm format? It was a wash, there wasn't anything clearly standing out at all. So my anecdotal experience and estimation is, you need to jump up a format if you want things to stand out in a mixed gallery of prints. I like lenses and I'm intrigued by optical advances. But this is a hobby on its own, and all is fine and well as long as people keep it at that and don't extrapolate/imply this has obvious repercussions on the photography side of things. If they do make such implications, then they'll get the same and opposite reaction by people who will say it doesn't matter at all. So let's appreciate the hobby - be it photography, camera design, lens design - for what it is. And if we want to make implications and extrapolations about a different aspect that are not warrantied, we should similarly expect opposite viewpoints and be tolerant to them. Also to keep it on topic, OP there's another lens to consider if you haven't already. Especially if you value a technically good lens with good performance across the spectrum with regards to sharpness, (lack of) distortion, flatness of field, flare resistance, and even bokeh. That's the f/1.7 ultron. It has a great combination of good qualities which are not easy to find (usually in such lenses bokeh suffers, in this case not only it doesn't suffer but it's actually good!). The only potential issue is ergonomics. But I believe to date it's the best 35mm lens Voigtlander has produced (barring the announced Apo-lanthar of which I know nothing about), and it's up there with the f/2 Biogon by Zeiss, if not better. The f/2 versions were an optical \"downgrade\" for the sake of size and weight as well as ergonomics. Or maybe because Voigtlander was paving the way for the apo-lanthar, so they decided for market segmentation to have an \"all-out\" great technical lens (apo-lanthar) and a smaller, cheaper and optically less performant lens (ultron). In such a product lineup the f/1.7 ultron, with it's increased weight/bulk *and* optical performance, would stand somewhere in the middle muddying the waters. In any case, check it you if you haven't already.

This is the only point I was making. 1 hour ago, giannis said: In fact a faster lens, \"all other things being equal\" will be less sharp than the slower lens, at all apertures. Many examples exhibit such behaviour. So if a faster lens, when stopped down to a slower aperture is sharper/better than the slower lens, this is not *because* it was faster initially, but *despite* of it. It's a testament to a good optical design and good manufacturing tolerances, if the faster lens can match or best the slower one at equivalent apertures. There is this preconception that a faster lens is (by default) better stopped down than a slower lens wide open, at the same aperture. This is not the case in principle though. I believe this notion exists because of an assumption that \"stopping down = boost in performance\" and hence \"the faster the lens = more stops to stop down = better performance\". However the lenses (the fast and slow one) don't start at the same *baseline* of performance at their wide open. It might very well be that the faster lens starts at a quite lower baseline at wide open, so even with the \"boost\" from stopping down, it doesn't reach the level of the \"unboosted\" wide open slower lens. There are no guarantees that the opposite will happen (i.e. outperform the slower lens), and if anything the chances are stacked against that scenario. What *usually* happens, historically, is that the faster lenses were considered more \"upmarket\" and \"professional\" so a more complex formula was utilised (sometimes also tighter tolerances), so they ended up performing better than slower lenses at equiv. apertures because of that better formula, despite their speed, and not because they were stopped down. Sharpness (and especially center sharpness) is only one element of a lens' performance. 1 hour ago, giannis said: I'm only mentioning this, because I think it's unfair to all those brilliant optical engineers that designed the lenses, to dismiss the performance of a faster lens just because it's stopped down more, as if it got a \"free\" performance boost. That boost was not free at all, and was built in the design of the lens, and the faster aperture was a negative factor - all things being equal - towards that purpose, that the optical engineers managed to overcome. So the praise is well deserved imo. Indeed, nothing is free in the world of optics. There's always a price to pay for a design's trade-offs.

When comparing this & that, up & down, again & again: The breaks in concentration make it difficult to maintain a system/structure of concentration on a number of different variables at the same time: \"Was it the 3rd leaf on the left or the 4th leaf on the left that had..........\"?

Main reason is to have a convenient choice for family holidays or other topics where I do not want to carry multiply lenses or change lenses AND want to have variable focal lengths (in good quality, obviously ). My main lenses are the 35 and 75 summicron-SL as also the 28 Summaron-m. I also have the 24 Sigma and for macro-work the Sigma 105 Art, but especially the Macro normally stays at home. I've tested the 24-70 against the 24-90 some weeks a ago and still did not come to a conclusion. Image quality wise it is more or less a wash. So now, after a few weeks of pondering I came to the conclusion to give the standard zoom a try. Due to size and price and limited availability of used 24-90s I've talked myself into the 24-70 and went yesterday to may local Leica-store to make me a birthday present. But, as you all know: The devil is a busy, busy squirrel, and so the store had a used 24-90 in near perfect condition for a very fair price (3.500 Euro) and a one year guarantee. So here I was, the clever fool. Trying back and fourth, and back again. The nicer and lighter lens is the 24-70. So it was constant 2.8 vs. 20mm more range and possibly a bit more robust Image stabilization, but larger size and a used lens which is roughly a whooping 1.000 bucks more expensive than the new one. Conscience said: New and saving 1.000 bucks and have the lighter one.. But in the end I've decided to go for the 24-90. Why: - Both lenses are bulky compared to an m or the summicron-sl lens - so if you walk with a single lens, it's not that huge of a different between the 24-70 and 24-90. - Depreciation: If I realize, that zooming was a nice try, but I want to ditch the lens again, I assume the loss of money on an already used bought 24-90 vs. a newly bought 24-70 will be less - I wanted to have a single convenient lens, and I know that I will start to think to also carry something longer in addition when using the 24-70 (I know, not very logical based on my base lens kit..) - So I decided, if convenience is the decisive factor, I go for the full blow - I like using manual focus override. Means, after focusing I turn the focus-ring, my camera jumps into magnification (my set up) and I re-adjust (I do this not very often, but want to have it on hand when needed). The focus ring of the 24-70 (i've tried 3) is super light to spin and therefore while holding and shooting, I every now and then accidentally turned the focus ring by a fraction and the viewfinder jumped into magnification-mode. The 24-90 focus ring is much more damped and therefore not so easy to turn accidentally. - Focus was a tiny bit more snappy on the 24-90. You also feel nothing when the lens is focusing. The 24-70 is also super fast and silent, but you can feel stuff moving and stopping inside when the lens is focusing. I assume that there is more mass to be moved in the 24-70. Again, no decisive factor. Just realized it and wanted to mention it Both lenses are very good, and still after the purchase I was not 100% sure But at least, yesterday on my birthday-bbq my daughter used my SL2s with the 24-90 and it was very convenient to have a zoom for her and the first results I've seen do look really good. Currently no buyers remorse, and I think I've made the right decision. And for my pure family holiday (not photo-holiday) in August I will only take the 24-90 and the 28-summaron and will then see if I will be happy or have a constant \"oh!-I-should-have-brought-my-summicrons\"-nagging I might buy the 24-70 lens hood.

've -----> made !!!  the right decision. and for my pure family holiday (not photo-holiday) in august i will only take the 24-90 and the 28-summaron and will then see if i will be happy or have a constant \"oh!-i-should-have-brought-my-summicrons\"-nagging i might buy the 24-70 lens hood. i've tried it on the 24-90 and it just looks so much less intrusive and massive with that lens hood. cheers edited july 13 by daniel c.1975", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 26822, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "farnz", "date": "2021-10-27 18:16:00", "content": "2 hours ago, T25UFO said: If cost is not an issue then it would be great to have both lenses; sadly, for most of us, cost is an issue and I\u2019m still struggling to see the value proposition in the M Noctilux over the SL Summicron.

They are mostly populated by Sony/Canon and I would say to a slightly lesser degree Nikon shooter. Doesn't make me enjoy my SL2 any less, and I definitely think the last firmware update made steps forward for AFC and tracking, certainly for larger animals and people. Tracking our dogs and grandchildren playing sports, keeper rate has risen. It really is just BIF that I struggle with. Stationary birds and animals, in good light the SL2 produces beautiful sharp detailed images. But, if I was heading off for what would probably be for me a once in a lifetime Safari @michali, I would be one of those \"wildlife photographers (clients & others) machine-gunning away at xxx frames/sec.\" with my R6, because I know AF just works, eye-detect on the R6 is gobsmackingly good, point the lens in the right direction the camera locks on and stays locked on, and I would want to make the very most of every opportunity. At home, or local to home when I'm in bird chasing mood I quite enjoy challenging myself with the SL2, after all it is supposed to be fun and I can always try again tomorrow\ud83d\ude00. I find it odd when some take criticism of the Leica so personally, and imply that not getting results is purely down to lack of technique, practise or knowledge because that isn't the case. Yes, we can all get lucky occasionally and get one or two good shots. If you are taking a special trip, only have one chance for that magical shot, the idea of using something less capable because it has a red dot is ridiculous.

I might be a bit late catching your inquiry and responding but here is what I have for you; 1- I only use Leicas (SL2 and SL2-S) with the exception of a short period where I used Pan S1H 2- Contrast detection is sub standard in today's world no matter what firmware and tweaks are used... this is especially serious in the video world. DOES NOT WORK 3- I have used over a dozen camera persons over the past year and a half. WITHOUT EXCEPTION... they use Sony cameras and I am baffled by how good their focusing is, EXCELLENT!. CONCLUSION (MY 2 pfenigs)... If autofocus is your high priority just go straight to the best which is Sony forget about everything else. My advice is based on many professionals I hire in my company. If video and AF is not your priority and you prefer the multitude of other advantages Leica's bring (far above Panasonic even)... then swallow the unusable AF in video and learn how to manual focus and stay in the Leica club....

As the conversation progressed, the client revealed that they needed a single image backdrop 'wallpaper' behind their topiary display of life-sized New Forest animals. And it would need to be 15 x 2.5 metres in size. And they would like heather in the foreground, trees in the distance and blue sky, preferably in 'thirds'. And can they have it by next Tuesday (four days away)? Nothing like a deadline and a strong 'wish list'... It became clear that I would need to shoot a specific image to fit the format (extremely narrow) which would ideally be of a flat landscape - as undulations would upset the third/third/third proportions. Weather forecast wasn't great, but very early Sunday morning looked to have a couple of clear hours and there was one possible location which still had a good flourish of heather and an almost flat horizon. The company printing the backdrop requested 100dpi as the viewing distance could be as little as 1.5m. A quick 'new document' in photoshop revealed a 1.6Gb filesize! The only possible ways to get anywhere near this amount of photographic data with my current equipment was to use the SL2 with a 4-shot stitch from 'Multi-shot' originals in landscape format or a 12-shot stitch from 'regular' portrait format originals. On the morning of the shoot, conditions were perfect, clear sky, practically no wind and a light dew accentuating the colour in the heather. Lens choice was 75mm APO Summicron M, set to f/11. The depth of field does deliberately fall off in the foreground, allowing the 'real' stand display to visually blend into the background (see images 5 and 6) I did shoot both options for stitching, however the 12-shot 'portrait' stitch ended up giving the better result. All images were processed from the DNG files into 16-bit files and then assembled using Photoshop's photomerge (using blend and vignette removal options).

You suggested that Leica is sorting out how to produce that look with the higher resolution sensors. It is interesting, I followed the 24 vs 47 megapixel thread that was posted a bit ago. In my mind, it has as much to do with the particular properties of the sensor as well as what Leica does with it on its way to producing a DNG. There are a ton parameters that go into this such as, the micro lens stack, the algorithms which turn the sensor data into a .DNG, etc. At the end of the day the initial look of the output ( as presented by the Adobe processing and presets ) and the malleability of the files is the our first impression of an image. As the saying goes, the first impression matters ( i do understand that by applying a particular preset on import can alter that first impression but there always remains that original lump of clay ). I guess it comes down to how the original lump of clay makes YOU feel. It sounds like you like the lump of clay the SL2-S hands you as it more closely resembles what you see when observing the world around you. Your post got me thinking, (thank you for that). My wife and I just moved from the Florida Keys to the North-shore of Massachusetts. The light is totally different. In Florida the sun is bright and there is less more contrast. In Gloucester there is less color but a greater tonal range ( I may not be using the right technical terms to describe this), I am having a harder time capturing and presenting this. But, the M10R seems to be better at it ( dynamic range?). It seems that the SL2-S in your mind may produce a similar outcome. I think your last statement is something that has been nagging me. I am an engineer by education and I have always strived to make the best technical decision when looking for a solution to a problem. As I gained more experience ( got older ) I found that I began to lean towards more elegant and simpler solutions. This may very well be happening as it pertains to my photography. In the back of mind I keep thinking the SL2S is a downgrade but maybe I just need to let go of that. I understand I will give up the ability to crop aggressively but maybe it will push me to be better at composition, getting closer, etc. I will never be one to say that cropping is not \u201cproper\u201d but there are ways to reduce its need .

I\u2019ve been doing a complete rethink in terms of re balancing my priorities when it comes to camera equipment. We find ourselves at a particularly interesting time in digital photography. The technological \u201cgaps\u201d that defined the highest quality from the very good in different areas is rapidly closing. By way of example the qualitative gap between full frame and medium format is closing so fast where the choice appears to be between 1) wanting \u201cmarginally\u201d better file quality above all else in which case medium format still gets the nod or 2) Near medium format file quality with a superior user experience, portability and features such as ISIS in cameras like the SL2. It won\u2019t be long before even these distinctions all but disappear as the physical size of the sensor becomes less and less important in determination of the ultimate quality of the output. The same could be said for the narrowing differences between crop sensors and full frame. Another gap that\u2019s been steadily closing is the margin of quality difference between top lens providers like Leica and third party offerings by companies like Sigma. A few years back personally I wouldn\u2019t have remotely suggested that a Sigma lens as a serious/viable option to owning Leica glass. In the last few years Sigma in particular has stepped up their game in a serious way. Whether an Art series lens is the functional equivalent of Leica glass doesn't feel like the relevant question. Leica continues to enjoy identifiable advantages in either color rendition, sharpness, overall rendering, micro contrast, bokeh or some combination of these factors. That said, it\u2019s hard to argue with the IQ per dollar invested in Sigma glass i.e. there is clear / tangible value particularly with Sigma's most recent offerings. Whether one shoots with Sigma\u2019s new 24-70 F 2.8, the Sigma 100-400 or any of the wonderful new I-series lens, it becomes increasingly clear that the image quality, handling, weight/size considerations at affordable price points is hard to ignore i.e. Sigma L-mount lineup is in fact as good as it sounds. With that backdrop I\u2019ve concluded that in current photography landscape with ever shrinking gaps in quality / performance, a \u201cblended\u201d camera and lens strategy is the one that makes the most sense, that is unless of course one has an unlimited budget. What does a mixed strategy really entail? I believe it all starts with an objective analysis of our real needs as photographers, both in terms of resolution, focal range preference, zoom flexibility versus prime quality/simplicity and many other factors. This is easier said that done since most of us (present company included) suffer from some level of GAS, with visible symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Once we\u2019ve determined our basic needs we can then narrow our focus by comparing the strengths and weaknesses of more affordable offerings (like Sigma) with the strengths and weaknesses of the best in class glass (like Leica). By way of example the new Sigma 24-70 F 2.8 is one the best L mount options in terms of price for performance. It's almost universally considered to be equivalent in terms of performance to the Panasonic and Sony offerings at twice the price. The Sigma 24-70 F 2.8 L mount has many strengths, but one of its weaknesses is that it\u2019s a little \u201csoft\u201d wide open at close focusing distances. If I thought this particular weakness was a deal breaker in my photography, I simply wouldn\u2019t have purchased it. I\u2019m mostly shooting landscape (and travel when conditions allow). Close focus performance while desirable in all lens, is far more important to me in the 16-35mm range as I\u2019m very often looking for a layered composition with well defined subject in the foreground. I therefore need best possible overall IQ performance in almost every respect in 16mm to 35mm range. This is what ultimately led me to select Leica\u2019s SL 16-35 on one hand and Sigma 24-70 F 2.8 on the other. Would I like to own Leica Sl 24-90 to go with my SL 16-35? Of course. Many recent Sigma L mount lens have the added benefit of being considerably smaller/lighter increasing the chances that I will actually have the lens with me when opportunity presents itself. I owned the 90-280 which may be the best zoom lens I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of using. In practice I found that it spent most of its time gathering dust on a shelf. Its a wonderful lens and it even looks good on a shelf, but one can certainly can find better (and cheaper) shelf ornaments. The Sigma 100-400 on the other hand while not in the same league in terms of performance, is way way better than its price would suggest and most importantly I find that I take it with me me on almost every outing, except on those occasions where I\u2019m limiting myself to 1or 2 lens. Possibly most important advantage of a blended OEM /Third Party lens acquisition strategy, is that it allows one to invest in few select lens (primes?) i.e. the real \u201ckeepers\u201d in the long run. For many Leica shooters that may be M glass. In my case it's the SL primes. I own the SL 50 F2 as well as the SL 90 F2. They happen to combine really well with Leica\u2019s SL 16-35 (again no quality penalty by saving money with Sigma 24-70) as I can always fall back on the primes when circumstances dictate. Would I have invested in the SL 50 and SL 90 if I simultaneously owned the SL 24-90 and the SL 90-280? The answer is no. Relying on Sigma for 24-70 and 100-400 freed up sufficient funds to purchase these incredible primes. The lens purchases are very personal decisions. The thought process and how it gets applied to each photographers priorities is what feels more universal. As a final aside, when it comes to use of primes and the challenging choice between SL2 versus SL2-s. In current setup where I own Sigma zoom in 24-70mm range as well as Leica SL 50 F2 and SL 90 F2, anytime I chose to rely on the SL primes instead of Sigma zoom, I know that with SL2 I can effectively get the equivalent result across the entire equivalent zoom range using the 2 primes and cropping as required. The result will effectively be the same (or better) than if I was using SL2-s with prime lens and no cropping. Clearly the exception would be in very low light conditions, where SL2-s will outperform SL2 whatever lens one is using. I tackled your last question first. In order to avoid turning this into the online equivalent of \u201cwar and peace\u201d, I think may already be there :), will cover SL2, Sl2s and TL lens questions/comments in a separate post later in the day. Hi Nicholas, Lots of thoughts in your post, many of which apply to any of the current camera and lens ecosystems on the market today. Currently for my CL and M I have only purchased and used Leica glass. In some ways I have been conditioned by what I read, in that the combination of Leica sensor treatment ( micro lenses, no filter, algorithms ) and lens construction results in the \u201clook\u201d. In practice I can see this in some of my photos but many look like the photos from similarly speced cameras. I like the idea of the SL system in this regard. I can purchase some Leica lens that will allow me to hopefully attain the \u201clook\u201d but also purchase other lenses for those occasions when other priorities prevail. For the SL2 or SL2S I am sure I would have a mixture of both Leica and non Leica glass depending on my objectives. I would definitely want to try the Sigma 100-400 and maybe one of there smaller primes like the 45mm. I will probably want to try the Leica 24-90 as a general purpose walk around lens. I suspect that if I am comfortable with size and handling it would become my most used lens. I tend to be a little lazy and don\u2019t necessarily enjoy carrying a lot of lenses around and swapping back and forth. I suspect with the SL2 i would use the zoom most of the time and carry one of my M lenses (35 Summulux) for use when the available light requires it. At this point I feel like I need to just make a decision regarding my priorities of low light and image quality vs the ability to crop and higher MP for landscape and printing.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317060-sl2-or-sl2-s-advice-appreciated/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4120669", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "317060-sl2-or-sl2-s-advice-appreciated", "result": true, "Selector": "i need to just make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "1 hour ago, nicholast said: you bring up some excellent points. i\u2019ve been doing a complete rethink in terms of re balancing my priorities when it comes to camera equipment. we find ourselves at a particularly interesting time in digital photography. the technological \u201cgaps\u201d that defined the highest quality from the very good in different areas is rapidly closing. by way of example the qualitative gap between full frame and medium format is closing so fast where the choice appears to be between 1) wanting \u201cmarginally\u201d better file quality above all else in which case medium format still gets the nod or 2) near medium format file quality with a superior user experience, portability and features such as isis in cameras like the sl2. it won\u2019t be long before even these distinctions all but disappear as the physical size of the sensor becomes less and less important in determination of the ultimate quality of the output. the same could be said for the narrowing differences between crop sensors and full frame. another gap that\u2019s been steadily closing is the margin of quality difference between top lens providers like leica and third party offerings by companies like sigma. a few years back personally i wouldn\u2019t have remotely suggested that a sigma lens as a serious/viable option to owning leica glass. in the last few years sigma in particular has stepped up their game in a serious way. whether an art series lens is the functional equivalent of leica glass doesn't feel like the relevant question. leica continues to enjoy identifiable advantages in either color rendition, sharpness, overall rendering, micro contrast, bokeh or some combination of these factors. that said, it\u2019s hard to argue with the iq per dollar invested in sigma glass i.e. there is clear / tangible value particularly with sigma's most recent offerings. whether one shoots with sigma\u2019s new 24-70 f 2.8, the sigma 100-400 or any of the wonderful new i-series lens, it becomes increasingly clear that the image quality, handling, weight/size considerations at affordable price points is hard to ignore i.e. sigma l-mount lineup is in fact as good as it sounds. with that backdrop i\u2019ve concluded that in current photography landscape with ever shrinking gaps in quality / performance, a \u201cblended\u201d camera and lens strategy is the one that makes the most sense, that is unless of course one has an unlimited budget. what does a mixed strategy really entail?

the answer is no. relying on sigma for 24-70 and 100-400 freed up sufficient funds to purchase these incredible primes. the lens purchases are very personal decisions. the thought process and how it gets applied to each photographers priorities is what feels more universal. as a final aside, when it comes to use of primes and the challenging choice between sl2 versus sl2-s. in current setup where i own sigma zoom in 24-70mm range as well as leica sl 50 f2 and sl 90 f2, anytime i chose to rely on the sl primes instead of sigma zoom, i know that with sl2 i can effectively get the equivalent result across the entire equivalent zoom range using the 2 primes and cropping as required. the result will effectively be the same (or better) than if i was using sl2-s with prime lens and no cropping. clearly the exception would be in very low light conditions, where sl2-s will outperform sl2 whatever lens one is using. i tackled your last question first. in order to avoid turning this into the online equivalent of \u201cwar and peace\u201d, i think may already be there :), will cover sl2, sl2s and tl lens questions/comments in a separate post later in the day. hi nicholas, lots of thoughts in your post, many of which apply to any of the current camera and lens ecosystems on the market today. currently for my cl and m i have only purchased and used leica glass. in some ways i have been conditioned by what i read, in that the combination of leica sensor treatment ( micro lenses, no filter, algorithms ) and lens construction results in the \u201clook\u201d. in practice i can see this in some of my photos but many look like the photos from similarly speced cameras. i like the idea of the sl system in this regard. i can purchase some leica lens that will allow me to hopefully attain the \u201clook\u201d but also purchase other lenses for those occasions when other priorities prevail. for the sl2 or sl2s i am sure i would have a mixture of both leica and non leica glass depending on my objectives. i would definitely want to try the sigma 100-400 and maybe one of there smaller primes like the 45mm. i will probably want to try the leica 24-90 as a general purpose walk around lens. i suspect that if i am comfortable with size and handling it would become my most used lens. i tend to be a little lazy and don\u2019t necessarily enjoy carrying a lot of lenses around and swapping back and forth. i suspect with the sl2 i would use the zoom most of the time and carry one of my m lenses (35 summulux) for use when the available light requires it. at this point -----> i !!!  feel like -----> i !!!  -----> need !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> just !!!  -----> make !!!  a decision regarding my priorities of low light and image quality vs the ability -----> to !!!  crop and higher mp for landscape and printing.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30953, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "NicholasT", "date": "2021-01-18 18:27:00", "content": "2 hours ago, eab said: Hi Nicholas, Lots of thoughts in your post, many of which apply to any of the current camera and lens ecosystems on the market today.

At this point I feel like I need to just make a decision regarding my priorities of low light and image quality vs the ability to crop and higher MP for landscape and printing. Yes in prior post I definitely ventured somewhat off topic. As long as you are ok with the size/weight of the SL 24-90 I think you will be very pleased with it as a general purpose lens. I sold it in favor of the primes, but also because at least in my case 2-3 hours was my max with that lens in terms of comfortable carry. With regard to your earlier question about my intentions with SL2 and SL2-s combo. I've just received my SL2-s. It was not an easy decision in that I sold my Q2 (a camera I loved) in order to purchase SL2-s. I intend to keep both SL2's. One of the key factors that led me to adding the SL2-s to SL-2 is so I can use use them independently in their respective areas of strength, or simultaneously in the field when traveling or when shooting landscapes. I often find myself shooting in windy or unseasonable conditions. The last thing one wants to be doing under those conditions is changing lens if one can possibly avoid it. I learned a long time ago when shooting wildlife in Africa, Yellowstone and elsewhere that there is no substitute for having two cameras with different lens mounted and at the ready. During golden hour for example lighting conditions change very fast so fumbling with lens changes is not recommended. Also during long exposures which can involve many minutes including noise reduction, I like to have a second camera so I can be taking different compositions during that narrow window with optimal lighting. Also as you mention having a backup particularly when one is traveling is a high priority. While it may be rare, if anything goes wrong and camera needs to go back to Leica its weeks if not months before one is back in action with that camera. Re TL lens use I'm not using them as much as I anticipated, but that's mostly because I'm not traveling. Since you travel a lot with your wife (love the fact that you're able to do so over extended periods of time) I'd be surprised if you don't find yourself using them very frequently. The lens pair very nicely with SL's in general and the IQ on almost all of the TL lens is excellent. Last but not least I strongly recommend you check out the Sigma I series lens. The Sigma 45mm F2.8 is my absolute favorite city/travel walk around lens. When I'm not shooting landscapes, that lens is permanently attached to my camera. I will be receiving the new 35mm F2 this week and can't wait to put it to good use. I may ultimately sell the 45mm in favor of the faster 35mm ( 35mm & 45mm probably too close to keep both).

If Sigma wasn\u2019t in the Alliance, I don\u2019t think I would get into the L-mount system. As far as bodies go, having been an M shooter for over 10yrs with a fairly complete set of M lenses that I like, I\u2019d definitely go for an Leica body. For L-mount lenses though, Sigma has a few unique lenses that have no equivalent options from Panasonic or Leica. A good example is the 14-24mm DG DN zoom which is great for astrophotography. As far as SL lenses go, the primes have a very unique modern look with the smooth bokeh and low contrast OOF areas that I don\u2019t think any other lens (even SL zooms) can replicate. To me, these will become classics (assuming they keep working 30+ years from now) whereas the current Leica SL zooms, although offering better sharpness compared to their Panasonic and Sigma equivalents is 2-3x more expensive and doesn\u2019t seem to have a rendering that stands out from the other options. For me, it\u2019s nice to have a sharp lens with good micro contrast if you\u2019re printing but most images these days are consumed digitally and are compressed. For this reason, most subtle improvements in micro contrast will be completely destroyed and go unappreciated when the images are shared digitally. On the other hand, a lens that offers a unique rendering/drawing/bokeh can be appreciated even on an iPad and that to me is very appealing. In other words, if I needed a decent zoom, I would probably go with a Sigma or Panasonic option and put the money I save into the real unique lenses like the SL primes. Hi Beewee, Thank you for the comments. Yes the L-Alliance makes the decision easier. Your comments regarding the Sigma lenses unique offerings will cause me to look at little harder at what that means, in some ways I have been focused on the body and knowing there is flexibility in lens selection has made that an easier decision. I think once I settle on the body, I will need to do more thinking about the lenses and work out a little road map based not he current offerings. Your comment regarding the unique rendering that the Summicrons provide vs the more generic Leica Zoom offering is one I really need to consider. I was going to start with the 24-90 and one of the bodies, but it sounds like I should not make the decision with out some more thought. I am sure I will purchase some primes if I enjoy the using the body and zoom but it will come after the zoom as I was planning on using M primes initially. I am going to look around on the forum for discussions on the zooms.

Have we been expecting this for some time? Anyone know/ or can guess why it's taking so long, could it be that the SL2 hardware is not able to take this step forward in autofocus? I am a fairly patient person, having tried a Panasonic S5 I know it's not a giant leap forward but it would be welcome, and it seems a long time coming. The SL2 and APO Summicrons give (to my eye anyway) the very best IQ there is, of course that comes at a price. But, put the camera in AFC - tracking tried every which way, and believe me I have spent many many hours trying various combinations and it is so so far behind the other options available it's painful, useable but frustrating. As well as the SL2 I also have a Canon R6.. with mostly EF lenses but a few RF lenses, including the very cheap and cheerful Samyang 85 1.4 AF, ( think it comes in at about a tenth of the cost of the 90 SL) and is of course a third party lens ( no alliance here\ud83d\ude09).

However, vexation sets in when I compare yesterdays sequence of shots to some I took a couple of weeks ago (in much poorer light which of course wouldn't help) with the R6 and Samyang lens. Similar settings, though it takes a bit longer to dial them in and learn the too numerous menu options of the Canon, the Canon set up did not fail to track and keep focus (sharp) throughout pretty much every sequence. In bursts of 10-15 shots I can't see where the Canon misses, in bursts from the SL2, maybe 1-2 shots in focus. With the SL2 and 90 SL continuously losing focus and just a few frames as keepers but having superior IQ to the many from the Samyang lens it's a case of quality over quantity. Now for me, who doesn't earn a living from photography, it's not vital that my SL2 nails it every time, I don't do serious wildlife and sports photography, the SL2 would be gone if that was the case.. just frustrated that Leica can't make the whole package, if they can't, they should at least give us what tiny improvements are available. Rant over.... feel free to shoot me down in flames, and I know, first world problems \ud83d\ude42. I\u2019m having a much better than expected experience with SL2 AF even on fast moving targets, even very fast. The caveat I found so far is strong back and side lighting can cause lots of false positives, but I believe this is a known issue with CDAF for some years now. I had my first shoot with the SL 90 yesterday and again was pleasantly surprised based upon upon what I read/warned AF performance wise. But was surprised with how stiff the MF focus ring. At this point I do however avoid AFC for the most part. The pulsing can be disarming as I am are trying to work. For AFC needs I feel iAF does a better job with the current SL2 firmware particular for very fast moving targets. I shoot AFS for moving targets too. But at some point I\u2019ll probably take some time to stress AFC and measure final image results against expectations. Like you I had to put in a lot of time experimenting with all the AF modes scenarios and sub settings. I am sure there are even more combinations for me to test with different scenarios. Yes, the SL2 could certainly use AF enhancement and like you and others, I\u2019m hoping to see some improvement in the next firmware. But honestly I am not expecting any major leaps in AF performance due to the higher resolution SL2. But recent DFD enhancements do look promising. I\u2019m still experimenting with a couple of what appears to be quirks, but this type of experimentation always works out for me as I learn strengths/weaknesses and how to get the best out any camera and honestly at some point I tire of the testing combinations and just use what I know to make it work which means my needed experimentation gets put off to another day.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323156-new-firmware-for-the-sl2-i/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-4265731", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "323156-new-firmware-for-the-sl2-i", "result": true, "Selector": "i know to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " 2 hours ago, boojay said: are we expecting a firmware update to improve af in the sl2 to bring it in line with the sl2-s (therefore having similar performance to the panasonic s5)?

Unfortunately it is. The flash system on the SL is seriously broken and Leica need to put in a fix, fast. If you shoot with hotshoe flash I think you'll have to hold off on the SL for now. These are my observations using a SF40, SF26 and 2xSF58's (fw 1.1 and 2.0) 1. Things appear to be normal in P and T modes. The flash fires as it should and exposures are fine (maybe a 1/3 stop under). However these modes are not available if you shoot M or R lenses. 2. In A mode the flash simply refuses to fire if the shutter speed is between 1/60 and 1/500 of a second. Are you serious Leica?? So you have no fill in flash throughout a significant range of shutter speeds in A mode. 3, M mode the shutter will fire at all shutter speeds. But as soon as you turn on the flash the exposure preview function for the EVF is disabled. So it's near impossible to visually judge a background exposure except by using the +/- in the EVF display. This totally negates the benefit of having an EVF. So in short, if you have the 24-90 you'll get expected operation in T mode. If you use adapted M or r lenses you're flat out of luck. I'm so incredibly disappointed by this. My main reason for spending $18,000 AUD was to get a better flash experience with the EVF than the M (sludgy with the grip/adaptor/plate setup). In my work I NEED to have an EVF and flash at the same time. Did no one at Leica or any of the several people involved with pre production cameras even put a flash on the hotshoe? I accept that either my camera is faulty or there is a workaround I have missed. Has anybody with an SL and TTL flash got the camera to fire at all shutter speeds in AV mode? Or the EVF to display exposure preview with flash in M mode? Gordon I have just made a few quick tests with my SL and SF 64 firmware v1.1 Using the 24-90 the flash fired in all camera modes A, S, T, P & M. Shutter speed longest set to 60th/s in A mode and still fired up to 8000th/s. I then mounted a 90 APO R with the adapter stack of M-L & M-R. The camera only has modes M & A available, but the flash still fires are all shutter speeds in either mode. My only observation of Leica's flash system is, if the flash is set for straight / direct (non bounce) the auto focus has no affect on the flash output, and the flash output is controlled purely by the TTL of the camera. With Nikon D300 / D800 + SB800, the flash output is determined by the distance that the camera has focussed on. That is the correct way to operate, as the subject matter has no influence on the flash exposure. The Nikon flash is perfect. Leica is not broken in my setup, but if they could just make it work like the Nikon system as I have described, that would make it on par. I have no experience of the other flash systems mentioned in this thread, but I am really happy with the SF64. The SL's bottom right located 'soft button' is set for flash bracketing which is quick and easier than using the controls on the rear of the flash.

For birding I use the Canon EF 400mm f/4 DO IS II USM with the Sigma MC-21 adapter. AF is not lightning fast but it's accurate. Only single auto focus is available, no continuous AF with this lens, IQ is exceptional, even with the Canon 1.4x TC mounted. This Canon lens is probably the best telephoto Lens I've ever owned, (I have the Carl Zeiss 300mm f2.8 C/Y as well as Leica R 280mm f4 APO Telyt). @helged also uses the Canon 400mm lens & shares a similar view. I also use the Sigma 100-400mm L which is an extremely versatile & light lens, I use it with the 1.4x TC. Image quality is good up to a subject distance of 15m to 20m max. For best IQ you have to use this lens with the electronic shutter, as there's shutter slap/shock with the SL2 as well as the CL. Having said all of this, I agree with Jaap regarding the limitations of AF for birds in flight. My best shots of birds in flight have still been with MF lenses.

Which always leads me to a \"I must have a 35mm lens\" setup. In the past, Leica M, this lead me to a 21, 35, 50, 90 plus the 28 Summaron (which is outside of every competition) setup. The lenses where smaller, so even if I wanted to go light, three or four lenses where a easy one. And with going on the move with just one lens, the 35 Summilux FLE was usually the choice, sometimes the 50 - depending on my mood. However, if I wanted to have a bit more flexibility but wanted to keep it really light, I always was in a hassle which to take. 35 and 50 are too close, the 28 Summaron and the 50 summilux will leave me in the dark at 28mm when dawn creeps on me ... ah, you know, the typical inner fights when you have or want to limit yourself With my move to the SL I decided to go for the 35mm first and added shortly after the 75mm. From my m-lenses I only kept the 28 Summaron (as said, still free of any competition this brilliant little bugger ). With the prices and the sizes of the SL-lenses most of us are a bit forced to make conscious decisions with the planned lens set up. Mine was, to later, once available, add the 21 Summicron-SL, as 28mm are too close to the 35mm (for cost and size reasons). BTW, I do think 28mm is a brilliant focal length, which makes thinks not easier ... In my urge to add something wider I've bought the Sigma 12-24, with which I did not warm up due to size and weight distribution. It is a specialists lens, and not for me. So I've made a change to the Sigma 3.5 24mm Contemporary, which is in fact brilliant. It is small, light, well build, renders really nice and can get ridicules close. And, I've payed around 550 Euro for it. I thought it to be a gap filler until the 21 or 24mm from Leica is available, but am not so sure any more. It is not my most used focal length, and the Sigma is more than good enough on the SL2-s. The 75mm is btw also a brilliant focal length. It is a bit more narrow than the 50, but not as tight and \"in distance\" than a 90. The 90 might be for many the better pure portrait lens. And yes, it might be more flattering, but in comparison, it is already compressing quite heavy, while with 75mm you get a more natural look - at least in my opinion. To make the confusion complete: When three lenses are the goal, which often is the case, I still think 28-50-90 is the most versatile set up as it is covering the broadest range. When starting with a 35-75 set-up, you will always be between the chairs when extending the range. A 50 would be close to either focal-length, a 28 very close to the 35, but still a workable partner to the 75, and also the 90 is quite close the 75 ... and so on and so fourth. My current solution: Core lenses: 35-75 plus the 28 Summaron(you meanwhile get why ) - extension: 3.5 24 Sigma and 2.8 105 Sigma Macro (also a great and not too expensive lens). Ideas: Why not a zoom again, maybe a 24-70? Or a nice 1.4 50 (oh, so huge), or adding the 2.0 50(\ud83e\udd24) ... or keeping the money until wisdom comes down on me ... my wife is just at this very moment shaking her head in disbelief ...

Otherwise my fear is that whilst a number of people here are of course satisfied with their SL2's and it meeds their needs, in 2021 many potential purchased of the SL2 (as their first Leica) may well be put off given it's poor relative ranking in terms of AF. If you of course have used a Leica M, CL or Q2 or the previous SL it might not matter quite as much to you. So either Leica knows this and the business plan for the SL2 is primarily to focus on these groups from which Leica forecast excellent profits or they are seeking a wider market share for the ROI to attract new users to the Leica fold like the Q2 has. Now none of us actually know this but my fear is that its the latter and that therefore they are reliant on a significant number of 'new wins', again it would appear that Panasonic are in a bit of trouble with S1R sales in particular so if they do launch an S3R then this of course could highlight the issue I & others refer to above even more.

Whether we like it or not Sony (and now Canon) has made AF a 'thing' and possible new purchasers of the SL2 and SL-S are going to demand a reasonable level of performance relative to these benchmarks but I don't think it has to be on a par, just better than now!! Now we could all go round and round on this but only time will tell and only Leica knows the numbers and what their partner Panasonic are up to, it will be very interesting to revisit this thread in a couple of years time No, I don't think you do understand the point I was making. I was not accusing you of wanting the latest shiny toy - it was placed in '....' - though that comment was only slightly tongue in cheek after reading yours about \"complacency\". My point was that while you may want the best AF/AFc and see that as \"universally acknowledged to be relatively poor\" (have you done a survey, to come up with 'universally'?), others (including me) do not find their photography dependent on AFc in the first place, nor does it need faster AFs - the quality of my photography is determined and limited by quite different things (see my website for what I photograph). I know with absolute certainty that I can find specific cameras that will perform better than a Leica in many specific respects. My wishes for cameras and lenses are determined not by whether someone else can do it better but whether something else would make my photography better, or whether I'd get greater enjoyment from it. I have no problem (as I wrote) with others who want faster/better AF. For me, AF is good enough, as are megapixels. My priorities are just different.

When I compare the image quality of the SL2 to the 50mp Fuji\u2019s , there wasn\u2019t a massive difference IMHO, but, in contrast, my test prints from the GFX100 sensor feel like a large and very noticeable jump from the SL2, particularly for someone like me that prints very large (at times up to 60\u201d). The SL2 has the multi-shot mode, but that felt to me more like a cleaner version of the same 47mp sensor than a higher resolution image per se. Pride of ownership and tactile use of the SL2 was high, however, but in this instance I\u2019m moving to the GFX100S for the larger and higher resolution sensor that (for me) makes a very big difference. Jon, Completely understandable. For your purpose, this is no substitute for more pixels in the original capture. As I stated in my original post, I shot Fuji X for over four years. The Fuji APS-C sensor create beautifully detailed images and the Fuji XF lenses are some of the best primes and zooms that I have ever used until I started shooting Leica. Fuji makes great gear. It's what I recommend to friends and family looking to upgrade their camera system. With 10s of thousands of images shot, I never had and reliability issues or other problems with my Fuji gear. Their great! The largest prints that I make are 16\"x20\" because my Epson P900 is only 17\" wide. Prints from images created with my M10-R or SL2 have subtly more detail when printed to that size than images created with my M10-P. As a test, I have used Topaz Labs Gigapixel AI to up rez cropped M10-P images for 16\" x 20\" prints with excellent results. The software is amazing. I use Capture One Pro 21 for my image processing and Topaz works like a plug in, kind of. Topaz DeNoise is also an amazing piece of software. This set up works for the occasional image. My most popular print size is 11\" x 14\" printed on 13\" x 19\" paper. I only use Epson papers. Any of my Leicas can easily print to this size without any software acrobatics.

It's small, with a classic / retro design, and the Nikon sensor plays really well with most M lenses. No IBIS though. Reviews are good, but I haven't had the chance to see one in person yet. I'd buy this over a Fuji. --img--  Hero, I want to second what Simone_DF suggested. But my answer is that there is no substitute for the Leica CL from any other maker in APS-C. Buy a second CL and hide it away for when / if you need to replace it. Fuji makes some sharp machines, but they feel foreign to my muscle memory. And it appears you like Leica for some of the same reasons I do, in that they're so elegantly simple to use and produce great pictures. Here are my thoughts and a little context. I have both a Nikon Z50 and the awesomely cool and fun Zfc. I grew up with Nikon for forty nine years, and only recently had the pleasure and privilege of becoming a Leica man. The Z50 and Zfc both make great photographs, and the Z S-Line lenses are amazingly superb and technically superior to all but a few of my F-mount Nikkor lenses. Even the little 16-50mm kit lens that came with the Z50 makes great photos. My Z50 is who gets to come along on backpacking trips in the back country or in a Ziplock bag on a float trip or day sail on the Sunfish. Haven't had the courage to do that to my Leicas I love the colors Nikon digital cameras make over all other cameras--except my Leicas. That's right I said it. There's just something about the colors and the feel of the images I make with my CL. And its B&W jpegs can keep up with the Q2M in ordinary daylight to my eye:) I can't pin it down with raw specs alone, I didn't buy my Leicas based on the specs alone at all. I bought my Leicas based on the cumulative satisfaction they bring. And holding a Leica camera in your hands is extremely satisfying. The CL with the little 18mm f/2.8 kit lens is around my neck most of the time I leave the house. (My wife says I'm a nerd, and jabs \"do you really need to bring your camera, honey?\") I carry the CL because it is such a simple pleasure to use, and it is an absolutely beautiful little machine. It makes such great pictures for all but my fast action shots of my kids on their mountain bikes and other sports. That's when the F5, F6 or D750 come out with a big fat, heavy 300mm f/2.8 on a monopod. Previous to the CL, my daily camera was the beautiful and stellar performing Df. It was just so natural and familiar to my hands and didn't slow me down from just taking pictures. The CL has surpassed the Df in all aspects of being my go out the door camera--even with only 18mm reach. (That's what my feet are for!)

(my wife says i'm a nerd, and jabs \"do you really need to bring your camera, honey?\") i carry the cl because it is such a simple pleasure to use, and it is an absolutely beautiful little machine. it makes such great pictures for all but my fast action shots of my kids on their mountain bikes and other sports. that's when the f5, f6 or d750 come out with a big fat, heavy 300mm f/2.8 on a monopod. previous to the cl, my daily camera was the beautiful and stellar performing df. it was just so natural and familiar to my hands and didn't slow me down from just taking pictures. the cl has surpassed the df in all aspects of being my go out the door camera--even with only 18mm reach.

So I was wondering if anybody around has some experience? A few hours searching the Internet bear no fruits as the CL is quite rare. Hi, I went through a similar dilemma. I've been shooting the Lumix cameras for some time GX8, G9, GX9, LX100 II. While I loved them and knew most of the features well, there was always a disappointment that the best photos were with the Leica blessed lenses such as the 12-60 Leica version vs the stock 12-60mm. These lenses were heavier and larger but performed visibly better. So I switched recently to the Leica APS-C: T then TL then TL2 and now my CL. The only Lumix I keep is the LX100 II which is all but in markings a D-LUX-7 and a great low light, compact street camera for me. That all said having shot the CL with TL23mm, TL135mm, TL18-56 I love the results but not the lenses so much. So now I've totally refreshed my CL kit to a Sigma 18-50mm and a Sigma 90mm both of which satisfy all my needs. But I do still carry my LX100 II as my backup camera because of its excellent low light and zoom capabilities f1.7-2.8 zoom. I do prefer the APS-C over the Micro 4/3 because it gives me more to work with, even though I do not crop (Bresson follower). I do use a tool that I will mention because it is open source and free: LightZone (http://lightzoneproject.org/). It's most important features for me are that it implements Ansel Adams zone system in a very effective way and uses non destructive tools which are applied in a stack way like we used to do with filters...

This is a record for me. So far, I think I like this camera much more from the start than my M's and SL's. Likes: size/weight: fits my hand very well and the weight with the 18-56 zoom is light compared to even my Ms with any small lens (my favorite travel lens is the 28 Elmarit ASPH). interface: iPhone like and fully customizable. I changed the video button to picture review. Even not reading the manual, I can figure out how to program most of functions to my needs after less than an hour. (using with out Visoflex) No need to bring the camera viewfinder to your eyes; frame about 6-9 inches away from your face. The autofocus and release feature is nice; just touch the desired focus point on the rear screen and the shutter is released as well. Fast enough autofocus for me. Leica was kind enough to include all of the adapters for world wide travel. In addition, the charger adapters attach directly to the charger it self. No need for a cord which is another less item to forget or pack. For airplane travel, I can pack my camera with the TL 18-56 with charger/SD cards/extra battery + travel CPAP machine/tubing/mask + iPad (for movies) and small laptop (to stay in touch with my business) all in one carry on which is a Tumi Alpha backpack. Even with all of this, it is not even close to being stuffed and is comfortable to carry. Dislikes: hood: large, plastic and unwieldy. I ordered a rubber collapsible B+W hood for protection while the camera is in the bag. Proprietary fiddly strap attachments. I do not like the included rubber strap and will get the Match Technical lug adapters so I can attach a conventional leather strap. Most importantly, I have not yet processed any files yet but will do so shortly. I don't plan on using the Wifi function at this point as I just post process on a desktop only.

It\u2019s been by far my favorite camera of all time when it comes to color. It\u2019s been one of the few cameras in my life that I\u2019ve truly loved. In the end through, I couldn\u2019t live with just a 28mm so Ive moved on (though I\u2019ve re owned it a few times). When the Q2 came out Imediatly bought it, but never could find the same organic, rich coloring that the original had so Ive sold it. I\u2019ve rented it several times since out of curiosity but even today look at those images (in raw), I just think they look \u2026well\u2026incredibly digital (and kinda like a higher res version of an iPhone if Im being honest). Ive had similar reactions to the SL2 but I find the SL2S to be pretty great. I currently own the M10R and the colors are good\u2026not as good as the Q, but not bad. Ive rented the first M10, as well as the M240 and in the end only the Q2 (Sl2) Ive struggled getting colors that look great out of. Had anyone else had similar issues? Ive tried C1, LR and lots of other profiles but nothing has worked. However, I do see folks online with great work with this sensor (deep organic colors, less digital looking etc) but its few and far between. Id like to get something small with AF too offset my M10R/M and Im half tempted to just go get another Q but Id really prefer to figure out how to make the Q2 sing. Any advice? I have the Q2, M10-R, SL2-S, Hasselblad X1D and have also used the SL2 and Q earlier. To my eyes (everyone else's mileage will vary): M10R with the right lenses can produce stunning results, easily keeping up in colors, tone and sharpness with my favorite of all - Hasselblad X1D. Surpasses the Q and perhaps the Q2 as well (but at the least matches the Q2 at same FL). Yes, it can take a bit more post-processing compared to the Q/Q2 to get the best out of M10-R Q2 - IMHO, what you see as \"digital\" look is increased resolution. Having used the Q2, I would not go back to the Q. I don't think you need to do any special processing. I am hard pressed to say anything \"bad\" about the Q2 SL2 - Same observation as above. I made the mistake of selling my SL2, replacing with SL2-S. Big mistake. So far as FF is concerned, SL2 with SL APO primes is unbeatable for my use cases which involve base ISO to ISO 1600. In my view it should be a crime to even think about using those lenses on any other camera.

Really appreciate your updates on the experience @Tobers. I'm currently going down the path of moving from Sony mirrorless to either the X100V or possibly Q2. This will be my only camera. I want the simplicity and portability that this approach offers. I will be using it for everything, which is mainly street, travel, family and some landscapes when hiking/traveling etc. Q2 is within budget but would be definitely at the top end.

For me, the quality of the pictures the Q produces has no comparison to the X100. I couldn't get over, even in sloppily taken shots, how good (exposure, autofocus) the shots were. I felt like I had a better keeper rate with the Q. I didn't like the Fuji flash (it's placement and it's use) so I never used it, and I never used the Q with a flash, so that Fuji built-in flash offered nothing for me. Plus, I wasn't as bothered by the Q's wider lens, something I thought would disturb me. Lastly, using the Q was so simple, I felt I didn't need a manual, that I could figure things out as I needed to make adjustments in the field, with the Fuji, I felt I had to carry the manual around. As for cost, I bought a used Q and then sold it later. I didn't lose much in that transaction, so you might consider that. I now own a Q2M and I have to say the 47MP sensor is game changing for me.

I once had the Chinese ambassador here come to my studio and talk to me because he wanted to buy a full Leica system, with a Noctilux, two cameras, several other lenses etc. He was ready to drop tens of thousands of dollars. He tried to focus with my camera and quickly found that his eyesight was not good enough to focus accurately. Rangefinders require good discrimination of contrast in a fairly small area. It only gets harder in lower light and when you get older...if you are not used to it and have difficulty, it is probably not the best choice. An SL camera would be a better choice in that case, as you could use M lenses with magnification and focus confirmation, as well as AF lenses. Another consideration is that the M10 has 24mp vs 47mp and (at least in my opinion), an older and technically inferior sensor. I had more issues with banding on the M10 than I have had on the SL2, which shares the sensor with the Q2. If I were going to go for a 24mp camera these days, the SL2S is the one with the best current image. If there is an update with an M11, then that may change, but it is another consideration. I am not trying to knock the M10 too badly...it is a very good camera, but it is also several years old at this point, and sensor performance is getting better and better. P.S. I don't want to discourage you from trying a rangefinder. They can be very quick to focus and use if you learn some tricks (looking for high contrast edges, like streetlight poles, walls, pictures, peoples eye's etc), but you need to have the visual acuity to use them. It is a different way of focusing than an SLR, and it has its advantages and disadvantages that are hard to judge without working with them for awhile (not just focusing in camera in a shop, but taking pictures and confirming you are actually spot on when you think you are).

So, before purchasing one, I wanted to make sure that this could be fixed and made a script to retrieve the crop factor and apply it in Capture One. 2 goods news: It's possible!

I went through the exact process as you. I had 6 beautiful Canon L Glass and Zeiss Lenses for my Cano 5D. The camera was great but when I packed everything up my kit bag was the size of my view camera kit bag and darn heavy. I decided to sell the entire system and purchase a used Q2 and am very happy with that choice. To answer one question Q over Q2 I would say Q2 would be your choice. Main reason when you want to use a different lens (longer than 28mm,you have that option with Q2 and plenty of pixels to accommodate) . At 47.3 megapixels you can use the 35mm or 50mm or 75mm crop and still have high res files.. the Q cannot come close to that with 24Megp . Weather proofing on the Q2 is significantly better than the Q, another reason to pick 2. I have not used or worked with the Q. So I cannot comment on performance comparisons. The final point I will make is the images captured using the Q2 (quality) is superior to anything I have used or owned. The small form factor allows me to put it over shoulder and forget I am carrying it. I print a lot of my stuff. From Silver gelatin from medium and large format film, ,platinum/palladium and ink jet and from both digital and film . Any file I print from the Q2 is extremely sharp.

Jeez:) So let me add to the heat a bit if I may! My comments are not meant to be inflammatory or insulting, but if you take them as such, please know that this is NOT my intention. To answer the initial question: For someone who has the money to spend on this question, the real answer is get whatever trips your trigger, i.e. whatever makes you fell better about yourself and makes you pick up the camera and have it with you at all times. For the rest of us common folk, we have to make do with possibly one camera and probably stretch a bit to buy any Leica, but I understand that this is not anybody else's problem but ours (common folk that is!). If someone is shooting ONLY B&W, then yes, the Q2M is a purpose made tool and its output (as Le Chef has been arguing all along) will be better, although it really depends on the use case and the ability of the shooter, i.e. if they know how to make it tick, which if course is true of any camera or tool for that matter. If one is doing both color and B&W and (common folk again) money is an issue, then I would argue that the Q2 or the RX1 or any camera will serve them extremely well, because they are not giving up anything major (i.e. the ability to shoot both color and B&W) for trivial gains (again, they have to really know what they are doing) in IQ on one of their domain, that is the B&W. The Monochrome does NOT help anyone see or think in B&W, this is just a rationalisation for people who want to buy one. It sounds like a good justification to others (especially wives: dear, it is a game changer, it will help me advance my photography to a whole different level blah blah blah), but, let's be frank here among us boys, there is no magic way to see / think in B&W that can be attributed to a camera, when one can replicate the stimulus on the EVF/LCD by choosing to see in B&W through the settings of the Q2. I would go a bit further to suggest something even more radical: if one cannot see / think in B&W without holding (HOLDING) a dedicated Monochrome camera in their hands (since we all agree that it is not the EVF that does the trick but the whole mentality that is afforded to a photographer by merely buying a Q2M), please do yourselves a favour and save your money - you do not NEED a Monochrome camera, you are not there yet and you can certainly work on B&W with whatever camera you have in your hands and still produce great or mediocre results. This is becoming a discussion among wealthy individuals who CAN own multiple Leica cameras and are trying to justify the purchase to themselves and/or others, which takes me full circle to my first point above. I have been photographing for 40 years now and I can say with certainty that holding a monochrome camera won't help ANYONE see / think in B&W, the same way that HOLDING a camera with a 28 mm lens won't help you see the world in that field of view. It is through years of experience (regardless of camera in hand, but very much depending on camera next to your eye) that one learns to see in 28, 35, 50 or whatever. Seeing and thinking in terms of B&W is a learned trait but if you are expecting to learn it because you spent 6k on a camera, you've got another think coming... Last but not least... cameras are primarily tools and yes, they can be our little babies too, I can understand that. BUT please, let's make points with our images to prove them, because otherwise it is just heat and a bit of show-offism... We can argue until the cows come home about the Q2M helping us see / think in B&W but the real test would be to see images that somehow exude that native, from zero to infinity, B&W mentality exclusively afforded to the photographer because they were HOLDING a monochrome camera:) Again, I sincerely apologise if anyone is offended by my comments, certainly this was not my intention. We are here to talk and help each other and share experiences and showcase our work with our tools of choice. To that end, my work (recently with the Q2 and before that with many other cameras mentioned on my site) can be seen at writelight.net, among other places.

No - it's a different lens with different technicalities ;it's not like you can make a 28mm into a 50mm, or vice versa.

So I\u2019m now seriously considering the M version to use with a pair of M4-P bodies. I\u2019ve read extensively about it and particularly like the positive comments here. The tripod mount is invaluable and will definitely be using it on my monopod. I\u2019ve just acquired a Gitzo one with shoulder stock. As far as the calibration of the auxiliary optical viewfinder is concerned, I\u2019ll make a test with my neighbours car number plate and a 33\u2019 tape measure. The elements and groups are identical for the M & R version. Both have a series one and two. The M lens has series VII filters for v1 and 55mm filters for v2. All were made in Canada. The R lenses had v1 made in Germany with series VII filters, and released in 1964 with 35/2.8, 50/2, 90/2.8 for the Leicaflex.

IMHO, my observation of the SL and S output is that their lovely rendering does feel slightly more \"gentle\" than the GFX100S with no post processing.....but now I wonder just how much of this is due to different inherent contrasts of the Fuji GFX100S output vs Leica SL/S output, ie, is the former inherently higher contrast with blacks that are more jet black and where shadows are less open than the SL/S output? For example, when I start to work on GFX files in-post to encourage more detail in the shadows and even slightly reduce color saturation, they start very quickly to get that more gentle rendering that I think I liked about the SL/S output. Even applying something as quick as Fuji's \"Eterna / Cinema\" camera profile in RAW essentially pushes the look in that direction, mainly because that Fuji profile reduces some of the contrast to create softer shadows etc. IMHO I think Leica created that look well anyhow in camera, but I've found various post-processing options to get me to a gentler look that I equally like with the GFX100S. Aside from post processing, clearly there is a ton of various diffusion filters, used especially in the cinema world to take the \"edge\" off modern digital cameras & lenses (eg, think of the aesthetic challenge of 4K), by variously increasing halation / lowering contrast that I'm also looking at for stills photography to achieve this rendering at the time of capture itself. Anyhow, beyond the logistics of trying to get an adapted S lens to work on a GFX, those are also reasons why I'd personally stick to native lenses for any given camera! This is an EXTREMELY important point. What we call \"camera\" comparisons are almost always \"converter default\" comparisons. It is usually possible to get any system's output to look very similar to any other's. The issues are 1) how hard is it to get what you want and 2) how often do you find yourself at the edge where the images start to \"fall apart\". I tend to make extreme changes to the color responses in BW conversions. My little Fuji X camera has nice color, but it can't hold the smoothness and contrast that the S does under those conversion parameters. The GFX 100 had slightly odd colors (to me!) and it took more work to get them into the Leica S ballpark, which is where I wanted to be.

In the S3 in particular, I found that custom profiles I made had much higher shadow noise than Adobe's profiles, which in turn had less shadow noise, but also desaturated shadow detail. Their profile was not neutral and I did not like the colors, but the camera felt handicapped in difficult lighting when using the Color Checker Passport profiles (yes, I know about dual illuminant profiles etc). I would say that if you can find a stock profile that suits your taste, that is generally the best option. If you want a more neutral profile, it seems to me that Capture One's base profile is a good option. Looking at the color chart I had, their base profile was more neutral. Adobe tweaks the greens, blues and reds etc. It is decidedly not neutral...at least in the S3. I also preferred a custom profile with the S006, but the difference was not as dramatic and Adobe did not seem to be doing anything too drastic to the S006 files, like they do with the S3. The SL2 is somewhere in between. I notice it most in the skies, where the Adobe profiles tend to be more yellow/cyan than blue/magenta. In general, like Jeff, I prefer custom profiles, but I think Adobe is changing how they handling processing in their software, and custom profiles are starting to be handicapped. I guess that part of this is that Adobe is pressured to have camera-tailored results for each new camera, and most cameras from major manufacturers have a number of different preset profiles (landscape, portrait, neutral etc), and Adobe does their work on those profiles. They probably figure that most users use that, and it is ok for them to hinder custom profiles a bit since not as many users use them.

I don't know what exactly it is that provokes the lag in my case, though over the years I have narrowed it down to when the body has been dormant for a while. It's not 100% though: sometimes my S typ006 goes without use for a couple weeks, and it's fine -- no first shot lag once out of the pelican -- and other times, it's in the pelican case for just a day or two, and the lag pops up next shoot. Only one laggy shot and all the pain is over for me though, so yes, I don't risk the potential downtime on it (not to mention the stress). I really appreciate your feeling about sending your body to Wetzlar to have it fixed. You are in HK? I'm in Tokyo, and I guess you probably have the same experience I do with lost time when it comes to Leica service and the S-system. My S lenses mentioned above... to have the AF motors changed out earlier in the year, that costed me four months (yes four, repeat 4, months!) and a lot of yen. I can't remember the thread, but someone -- a member of our user group, living in Europe -- posted their bill for this same AF motor upgrade service and their bill was about 40% cheaper than what Leica Japan quoted and charged me. I did use that post as evidence and took the service cost issue up with Leica Japan, but they explained the extra costs with sending the lenses in and out of the country, yen-euro rates, and yada yada yada... ultimately they knew and I knew I can't do anything but send the lenses through the official channel -- i.e., them -- for the fix, and the price is what they say the price is: take it or leave it. So, thinking for the long term, I took it. I had waited until a big lull in jobs for me at the end of last year (thanks to Corona virus related cancels and in one sad case, my customer going out of business) and sent the lenses off. I had a few jobs in the intervening four months and used a second hand Olympus e-m1 mark ii body with adapted four-thirds lenses (from my first ever camera system, the Panasonic DMC-L1) to complete those jobs [somehow!]... and a few months ago now, my lenses came back to me, like new, and I am back on track. That brief period of stress is just a memory now. And what's better, I have rock-solid dependable lenses in-hand. (And should I ever choose to sell any of them, I have a stronger hand than if I hadn't had the AF motors upgraded. Not that I ever plan to sell any S-system equipment though.) I relate this story of mine about the lenses to you to express how I understand the time loss and aggravation in sending your new S3 body all the way to Germany; and for an issue which shouldn't even be there in the first place. Knowing Leica, they may even try to charge you some money to fix (this is Leica service and we've all heard both sides of it\u2014people getting amazing service for zero, and other people getting assassinated with extra charges for servicing they never even requested in the first place... it really seems like luck of the draw with Leica service)... But the other element of my story is: it's better to get this out of the way upfront and take the hit now, for a long and happy user experience thereafter. I'm sure your camera will still be under warranty, so the less you wait, the stronger your demands on Leica service can be I'd imagine. You will have to make do with another camera or camera system while your S3 is away, and no doubt it will be months and months, the same as it is for us in Japan [for other readers: Leica Japan cannot itself do any S-series servicing outside of rubber body armor replacement and sensor cleaning; for everything else, generally the cameras or lenses have to be sent to Germany]. But even still\u2014if I were you, I would seek to get this issue squashed (fixed) here and now... your \"short\" term (I know weeks and months are not prima-facie short term) pain on that fix is easily offset by the long-term happiness and confidence in a camera that works as it is supposed to (and won't be a problem to sell, should you ever choose to; don't sell it though!). This is all just opinion prismstorm\u2014you know your situation better than we do, so you go the way you see best. Once again, I hope things brighten up a bit for you! P/S on the battery... what is your battery performance like when not tethered? As I mentioned, in my own small experience, tethering seems to burn through battery at a quicker rate than normal (not tethered), and not just for Leica cameras\u2014I've had this same experience with Nikon (and Olympus!). Untethered, and with the battery grips on the S typ006 or S2-P that I use, i.e., with two batteries in, I have found the stamina of my S-cameras to be quietly impressive. Not ALL CAPS WOW THIS IS AMAZING, THIS IS THE BEST EVER, ALL SUPERLATIVES EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECOND BEST... just \"hm! still going, wow\" type thing. I think it's probably the best battery performance I've ever experienced, but then again: both the S cameras I use do not have Live View, which can be a major battery drain.

P/S on the battery... what is your battery performance like when not tethered? As I mentioned, in my own small experience, tethering seems to burn through battery at a quicker rate than normal (not tethered), and not just for Leica cameras\u2014I've had this same experience with Nikon (and Olympus!). Untethered, and with the battery grips on the S typ006 or S2-P that I use, i.e., with two batteries in, I have found the stamina of my S-cameras to be quietly impressive. Not ALL CAPS WOW THIS IS AMAZING, THIS IS THE BEST EVER, ALL SUPERLATIVES EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECOND BEST... just \"hm! still going, wow\" type thing. I think it's probably the best battery performance I've ever experienced, but then again: both the S cameras I use do not have Live View, which can be a major battery drain. At any rate... certainly with regular quick and dirty portrait/profile jobs where we can just use the back LCD on the camera to confirm shots, and the shoots themselves [shooting time, not setup and breakdown] are done in about an hour tops... those scenarios, my camera bodies can go for days at a time (of two maybe three shoots a day) before I would need to switch out batteries.

Take the short term hassle of being without your camera for the long-term gain. It's just friendly advice though, you know best! Hi there TomLiles, I am based in Hong Kong, and I have relayed my question regarding the shutter lag to the official customer service in the flagship store to no avail. I have also sent an email to Customer.Care@leica-camera.com with no reply as of now. I am very reluctant to send in my S3 for this problem alone, since several months of down time for a camera that costs this much is hard to swallow, having only owned it for around a month. I have multiple other cameras to carry on my shooting with, including another medium format system and two other Leica full frame systems, so redundancy is not a problem for me. I just really want to use the S3 because it's enjoyable, and gives the best color and files for me when shot in studio. When I go out I don't use the S, since my other cameras have much more stability and much less shutter shock. But with all artificial lighting and a small aperture, I can overcome any focusing errors due to focus and recompose and the center-only focusing point, and eliminate camera shake altogether. I applaud you for having the guts to put your S system in a Pelican. I only put mirrorless gears / strobes in a Pelican due to the constant rolling on uneven terrain and the bumps and shocks everything inside it is constantly receiving. I tend to put gear with mirror boxes and mechanical tolerances (Leica M, S) in backpacks, so they don't get knocked out of mechanical alignment, and result in focusing issues. I am now patiently waiting for a reply from Leica Customer Care, and will follow-up on the issue locally through the repair department of the HK flagship store. I don't want to send it in because the highest grade Leica gear are only allowed to be repaired in Germany, not even the Shanghai service center.... and who knows what the downtime will be due to COVID-19...Think of all the shoots I will miss on using the S3 with several months of its absence. I have not tried using the S3 in available light at all, all the battery performance so far has been related to studio use, with a flash trigger always on the hot shoe, and half of those times tethered to C1. Again, I don't use S3 in available light because of the very high rate of shutter shock ruining my final photos. Although, I can say that the battery definitely lasts longer than my SL2-S and X1DII, since it is beefier and thicker, and does not run constant live view either in the EVF or LCD. I have purchased and owned all Leica systems, including the S, SL, Q, CL and M, I bought into the S for the colors, tonality, and how alive everything seems to render. Technology wise, the SL2 generation stomps all over the S with its IBIS, multi-shot, EVF, face detection and video specs, but the connection you get with the S's OVF and instant mechanical feedback of a DSLR are just not found elsewhere in any of Leica's other systems.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/320337-first-shot-after-turned-on-fps-very-laggy/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4212164", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "320337-first-shot-after-turned-on-fps-very-laggy", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " 12 hours ago, tomliles said: hi again prismstorm, yes, the version of the \"first shot lag\" issue i get is quite sporadic and not a big enough deal to bother risking huge downtime on with leica service. i don't know what exactly it is that provokes the lag in my case, though over the years i have narrowed it down to when the body has been dormant for a while. it's not 100% though: sometimes my s typ006 goes without use for a couple weeks, and it's fine -- no first shot lag once out of the pelican -- and other times, it's in the pelican case for just a day or two, and the lag pops up next shoot. only one laggy shot and all the pain is over for me though, so yes, i don't risk the potential downtime on it (not to mention the stress). i really appreciate your feeling about sending your body to wetzlar to have it fixed. you are in hk? i'm in tokyo, and i guess you probably have the same experience i do with lost time when it comes to leica service and the s-system. my s lenses mentioned above... to have the af motors changed out earlier in the year, that costed me four months (yes four, repeat 4, months!) and a lot of yen. i can't remember the thread, but someone -- a member of our user group, living in europe -- posted their bill for this same af motor upgrade service and their bill was about 40% cheaper than what leica japan quoted and charged me. i did use that post as evidence and took the service cost issue up with leica japan, but they explained the extra costs with sending the lenses in and out of the country, yen-euro rates, and yada yada yada... ultimately they knew and i knew i can't do anything but send the lenses through the official channel -- i.e., them -- for the fix, and the price is what they say the price is: take it or leave it. so, thinking for the long term, i took it. i had waited until a big lull in jobs for me at the end of last year (thanks to corona virus related cancels and in one sad case, my customer going out of business) and sent the lenses off. i had a few jobs in the intervening four months and used a second hand olympus e-m1 mark ii body with adapted four-thirds lenses (from my first ever camera system, the panasonic dmc-l1) to complete those jobs [somehow!]... and a few months ago now, my lenses came back to me, like new, and i am back on track. that brief period of stress is just a memory now. and what's better, i have rock-solid dependable lenses in-hand.

Thanks for your comment. I've got a test strips done off a Lambda printer to 60\" from the SL2 in \"high resolution mode\" with the SL 50 APO.

It is bitingly sharp in terms of acuity - almost too much - so am trying to figure out if i can make it look gentler in its rendering. The thing I like about the 5x4 is that it looks to have c 100mp of resolution, so fine detail is in abundance, but to my eyes the prints' rendering never looks harsh at the same time. If you have any suggestions on processing to make these images look gentler, I'd love to hear them. I'm looking in more earnest at files from the GFX 100. From what I can tell from examining files, the detail feels similar to what i see off the SL2 in its \"high resolution mode\", but the medium format maybe has slightly smoother tonal transitions ...something i'm looking into. Clearly a native 100mp camera has the benefit of not worrying about motion blur when capturing the shot (compared to a pixel shift function), even if the SL2 is quite good in one its modes at negating that motion blur.

Here\u2019s #9 fitted with the Zeiss lens (and lens hood). Since I went that far from original, I added a finder off an E , --img--  I am back on this thread. The 8 mm slit width was not Mr Kim\u2019s idea.it was my idea and I explained the reasoning for it in an earlier thread. Film speeds back when Mr Barnack was designing his revolutionary UR were around ASO 5, now they are ASO 400. That means that film speeds are 100 times faster now. The original slit was 38 mm. I also looked at the O series camera of Leitz issued to celebrate the millennium and realized that 8 mm was a good compromise between the 5mm and 10 mm slits on the O series camera that I have. Also if you study the camera and the tight fit of the clutter curtain, the slit must be very narrow (Mr Kim and I still do not know how Barnack fit that wide slit shutter into the UR as space is exceedingly tight). Now we did not know the Speed of the original UR shutter. We also were not sure what the speed of the shutter in our UR Replica would be until we started running film through the camera. It turns out the shutter speed is around 200 and 400th of a second depending on the tensioning of the shutter spring using the dial on the top of the camera. Do understand there were many variables that we did not know. Being a physical chemist,I understand that when you have that many variables, you have little control over the final result. We were never able to see the original and evidently it does not work. Even when I visited Leitz, Wetzler, during the 50th Anniversary Meeting of the Leica Historical Society gathering in 2018, I was not allowed to see it! Like it\u2019s is in a vault in the basement and even I, who spent so much time bringing the UR Dummies back to life, could not see it. I was disappointed but then we also had a busy meeting and there were other fish to cook. Also since it did not work I was really interested in the film counter and I turned this final challenge to Mr Kim and he solved it. So in summary there were reason for the 8 mm slit and I was the one who made the decision to go with it and am pleased to say in nine sight, it was the right decision based on science and guess and the final photographs that to this day knock me over!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/138638-working-ur-leica/page/13/?tab=comments#comment-4161032", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "138638-working-ur-leica", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "14 hours ago, ambro51 said: one thing to add is the 8mm slit width is purely the creation of mr. kim. oskar used a full frame width slit, which of course would change relative exposure times. so, the original camera very certainly had shutter speeds more in the 1/30 to 1/60 range. a main issue within the ur is lack of space. to wind this much tape and material around the spools is very difficult. my success with my conversion on #9 in the end relied on turning down the spool diameters. it was pure trial and error, plus at least 500 takeaparts and fiddling. -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  the shutter curtain and tapes from typewriter ribbon, -----> made !!!  lightproof with thin applications of liquid electrical tape. but, in the end, it worked! here\u2019s #9 fitted with the zeiss lens (and lens hood). since i went that far from original, i added a finder off an e , --img--  i am back on this thread. the 8 mm slit width was not mr kim\u2019s idea.it was my idea and i explained the reasoning for it in an earlier thread. film speeds back when mr barnack was designing his revolutionary ur were around aso 5, now they are aso 400. that means that film speeds are 100 times faster now. the original slit was 38 mm. i also looked at the o series camera of leitz issued to celebrate the millennium and realized that 8 mm was a good compromise between the 5mm and 10 mm slits on the o series camera that i have. also if you study the camera and the tight fit of the clutter curtain, the slit must be very narrow (mr kim and i still do not know how barnack fit that wide slit shutter into the ur as space is exceedingly tight). now we did not know the speed of the original ur shutter. we also were not sure what the speed of the shutter in our ur replica would be until we started running film through the camera. it turns out the shutter speed is around 200 and 400th of a second depending on the tensioning of the shutter spring using the dial on the top of the camera. do understand there were many variables that we did not know. being a physical chemist,i understand that when you have that many variables, you have little control over the final result. we were never able to see the original and evidently it does not work. even when i visited leitz, wetzler, during the 50th anniversary meeting of the leica historical society gathering in 2018, i was not allowed to see it! like it\u2019s is in a vault in the basement and even i, who spent so much time bringing the ur dummies back to life, could not see it. i was disappointed but then we also had a busy meeting and there were other fish to cook. also since it did not work i was really interested in the film counter and i turned this final challenge to mr kim and he solved it. so in summary there were reason for the 8 mm slit and i was the one who made the decision to go with it and am pleased to say in nine sight, it was the right decision based on science and guess and the final photographs that to this day knock me over!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 35898, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "zwieback", "date": "2021-03-16 18:33:00", "content": " Update: To my big surprise, the camera already showed up today.

A notable discussion is in this posting / comment string: In a previous posting I compared the Leitz 800mm f/6.3 Telyt-S lens to the Canon 800mm f/8.0 S-Set lens (a cemented doublet achromat) and to the Nikon 800mm f/8.0 Nikkor-P lens (a modified Ernostar/Sonnar design). Both of these were designed before Leitz lens introduced in 1972. I wanted to compare the Leitz lens to later super-telephotos produced by Nikon using special glass. (For reference on the incorporation of special glass in telephotos, by other manufacturers, Canon introduced its 300mm f/2.8 fluorite lens in 1974, Nikon introduced its first ED (Extra-low Dispersion) super-telephoto lenses in 1975, and Canon introduced its 800mm f5.6 UD (Ultra-low Dispersion) lens in 1979.) I was able to obtain a Nikon 800mm f5.6 IF-ED lens recently. I also purchased a Bausch & Lomb 800mm mirror lens. And I decided to include a Nikon 400mm f2.8 lens with 2x teleconverter. I have used this lens extensively for years with and without the teleconverter. And finally I included the Nikon 400mm f2.8 lens, cropping to an 800mm image size in Photoshop. So to further gauge the performance of the Leitz 800mm f/6.3 Telyt, I compared it to four other 800mm lenses or imaging approaches that used the newer lens designs and were available after the Leitz lens. The first lens is the Nikon 800mm f5.6 IF-ED Ai-S lens, introduced in 1985. The second lens is the Nikon 400mm f2.8 ED AF-S II lens, 2001 version, with the TC-20EIII 2x teleconverter, introduced in 2009. The third lens approach is the same Nikon 400mm f2.8 ED AF-S II lens, 2001 version, just cropping Photoshop to the same image size instead of using a teleconverter. The fourth lens is a Bausch & Lomb 800mm f10.0 mirror lens, date unknown. To test the lenses I used the same lens test chart (43 x 56 cm) as in the previous comparison, but remounted to achieve better flatness. The test chart was about 50 ft / 15 m from the camera focal plane. The images included a little more than just the test chart. I cropped off the outside edge so the edge won't effect the histogram. I used the same Nikon D5 because it is still the only digital camera I have that can mount all the lenses and has electronic focus confirmation. I did not use an electronic shutter release cable this time. The D5 can be set to raise the mirror with a first shutter release and then trip the shutter with a second shutter release which proved more than adequate for the support approach I used. I sampled at max aperture, f8.0 and f11.0. I made images at correct focus indicated on the ground glass and with electronic focus confirmation, and I shifted focus slightly fore and aft to insure I nailed the focus. In all cases the ground glass/electronic focus confirmation was correct. I tried the 400mm f2.8 autofocus lens without the teleconverter in both autofocus and manual focus modes, with no difference seen in the result. The 400m f2.8 lens with the teleconverter was manually focused for consistency with the Ai-S lens. I am only showing the max aperture results because the f8.0 and f11.0 results did not add any further information to the comparison. These lenses are hard to hold steady. Dah. The Telyt has two tripod mounts; the Nikon lenses have only one tripod mount but are more compact lenses, being true telephotos. Instead of using two tripods for the Telyt-S, as I did previously, I used a solid work bench table. The tripod for the other lenses was a Gitzo GT4552TS carbon fiber tripod. The Gitzo is designed to hold the largest and heaviest telephoto lenses available. I used a Wimberley WH-200 gimbal head on the Gitzo tripod. The results are attached. In addition to showing the test chart itself, I superimposed the histogram for the test chart in the lower right. Color fringing can be seen in the histograms considering shifts in the spikes for the three colors, The tightness of the black spike is representative of the sharpness of the black graphics. The image from the 400mm f2.8 Nikkor is slightly brighter; I apologize for that mistake. The results for the professional Leitz and Nikon lenses are nearly identical. Even the cropped image from the 400mm lens without the teleconverter is nearly identical. The problem with this image processing approach is that there is little crop capability left. In fact Photoshop resampled the file to produce enough pixels to match the other files. The teleconverter approach is great and I have used it for years, but it eliminates the option to use a teleconverter with the 800mm lens for a massive 1600mm equivalent. While one would hope the inexpensive Bausch & Lomb mirror lens might be a usable approach, the lens simply is poor. The image was so poor that it was hard to focus on the ground glass. The lens seems dimmer than f10.0. Electronic focus confirmation would not work with this lens either. --img--  --img--  --img--  --img--  --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/325672-review-of-leitz-800mm-f63-telyt-s-lens-part-2/?tab=comments#comment-4298974", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "325672-review-of-leitz-800mm-f63-telyt-s-lens-part-2", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " the leitz 800mm f/6.3 telyt-s lens occasionally is discussed on this sub-forum. a notable discussion is in this posting / comment string: in a previous posting i compared the leitz 800mm f/6.3 telyt-s lens to the canon 800mm f/8.0 s-set lens (a cemented doublet achromat) and to the nikon 800mm f/8.0 nikkor-p lens (a modified ernostar/sonnar design). both of these were designed before leitz lens introduced in 1972. i wanted to compare the leitz lens to later super-telephotos produced by nikon using special glass.

So the collapsible (11631) seems to be out of production at this time. The collapsible already wasn\u2018t listed in a brochure \u201eLeica-Objektive\u201c from I/62, which still had the LTM rigid version. So it seems that the collapsible went out of production in 1961, whilst the LTM version was still made in 1962 and perhaps the first months of 1963. Though dealing with Leica items always means coping with inconsistencies: a pricelist (10-5a) from Jan. 65 still lists the collapsible version 11631M for 296,-DM, the rigid version 11830R was 258,-DM. The latter must have been the 3-elements, as they didn\u2019t give this new version a new number. Perhaps the entries in pricelists can be explained by the fact that quite a lot of copies were still on the shelves in Wetzlar or at the dealers, so even when an item was not produced any more you could regularly buy it. P.S.: even the pricelist 10-5q from Febr. 1966 still has the entry for the collapsible for 296,-DM. Really interesting indeed. It seems there's material for an interesting article there. There is a really valid point that is a different topic is when the lens production ceased and when it was drop from the catalogs due to the stocks on the shelves. 23 hours ago, Pecole said: Your obsevation is right, Augusto : the 1920084 was a \"3-elements\", as confirmed in my archives. Something I discovered when investigating : the code is given as 11830 or 11730. I could not investigate further. Thank you very much for the confirmation!!! That means that one of the in-doubt batches (1.920.001 to 1.921.000) is made of 3 Elements (or at least has already 3-Elements samples). That, once more, confirms the theory that the 3-Elements was not introduced in 1964, but in 1962 like I suspected. 12 hours ago, luigi bertolotti said: That's an intersting topic : having all the Elmars I have made a simple test exchanging their lensheads (not possible with the rectractable, of course) : all ok EXCEPT for the E39 : mounted on previous barrels RF focus is inconsistent. Hi Luigi, that was exactly the warning that Jerzy gave me when searching for a late screw mount 4 elements. The lenshead could have been exchanged and in that case the RF focusing was going to be off. That was the reason for the immediate checking the matching scratched number in the barrel. Anyway and to you all, thank you very much for the information that you've provided. Once more, I'm currently thinking on writing a short article about this topic after getting properly documented.

It is in need of a bit of care as it clunks and sticks a fair bit now - I could and probably should do this, however, I don't think it's that great anyway. I could make the leap to abandoning my universal and CS mags - or just the CS. Various people have tried to steer me to Elmo or Kodak. However, I think a Leica may be the way to go - or at least a projector of roughly equal quality. It would also be good to hang on to the CS and universal magazines rather than have to transfer everything over to new magazines. I know that the Pradovit PC and Pradovit IR can take CS mags.

From a marketing point of view, 9cm would make more sense. 8,5cm is odd, even though Leitz had the previous odd balls with the 7,3 Hektor and the 10,5 Berg Elmar. Perhaps the fact that Zeiss had the 8,5cm Sonnar played into the decision to go with the 8,5cm focal length for the Summarex, even though the Zeiss lens was \"only\" an f2 lens. Looking at the formulas of the Summarex and the Sonnar, the Sonnar is a much simpler design, and would have been much easier to make. There must have been some reason the OKH \"kept the faith\" with Leitz and the Summarex, perhaps we will never know. All of the auxiliary viewing devices would have to include the new focal length as well, since the Leica models at that time only had a viewfinder set at 5cm. In reality, 8,5cm and 9cm field of view is so close as to not have to worry about it. Also, given the formula for arriving at the front diameter of a 1:1,5 lens, there is a significant difference and this is much harder to reconcile. From what Luigi is telling us, when such a high speed lens was in development (1936) to when it entered into production (1943), was quite a long period of time. Smakula at Zeiss is credited with the invention of anti-reflective coating in 1935. This process was jealously guarded by Zeiss, but I am sure that during the war someone higher up made the decision to make the Zeiss anti-reflective coating available to Leitz. At this point I am relatively certain that this was part of the delay in producing the Summarex. Even with the early coatings, they would have made a big difference with a high speed lens in regard to light loss versus a non-coated lens. Of course, we being photographers can easily understand this, but to the OKH procurement people, all they knew is that Leitz was dragging their heels on this in their view. The fact that Ludwig Leitz was himself involved in these discussions in Berlin would indicate the intense interest and impatience the military had in the procurement of these lenses. Please keep your ideas and the discussion going. I think we are making great progress here by putting our collective heads together!

This is a photo magazine, Kleinfilm-Foto, from Jan-Feb 1941. In it, an article talks about Leica and the development of high speed lenses. Of particular interest is the last sentence where it mentions \"an outstanding lens is the 9cm, 1:1,5 lens.\" It does not say whether is a Summar or Summarex, only that it is a 9cm lens. The article also talks about another high speed lens from Leitz, the 7,5cm 1:0,85 Summar. Could there be a pattern here? High speed lenses with the name Summar. Remember, Leitz naming convention was based on lens speed, not lens design type as at Zeiss. Leica lens naming is still based on lens speed, i.e. f2.0 lenses are Summicrons, f1.4 lenses Summilux, etc. These comments in the article are from Otto Zimmerman, who Jim believes was the head of the Optics Department at Leitz, Wetzlar. In addition, Jim says there are no written entries for 541055 or 541056. He shows 541056 in his Vol.2, Leica Lenses book. The notation for 541057 says Summar 9cm shipped to Berlin on 10.5.41. 541058 shows 9cm 1:1,5 shipped 25.11.41 to Berlin. My educated guess is that 541057 and 541058 were sample lenses marked 9cm, when in fact they were actually 8,5cm lenses. One of them, if not both of them, were marked Summar. These lenses were then shown to the powers that be at the OKH. Upon inspection and possible testing, the OKH placed the order with Leitz at some point for the lenses that were finally delivered in the batch from 593100 on in 1943. Again, we can only be guessing that at some point, Leitz changed the engraved focal length to 8,5cm from 9cm, and the name from Summar to Summarex. One can only speculate why they were marked 9cm. It is highly unlikely that the 9cm and 8,5cm lenses are in fact two different lens designs. More likely would have been a rounding up or rounding down of the actual focal length. Hypothetically, the actual focal length could have been 8,7cm, and these were rounded up to 9cm, perhaps for marketing purposes or simplification of the lens catalog listings. For example it is well known that the actual focal length of the Rigid 50mm Summicron was actually closer to 52mm, and the lenses were marked as 50mm. We will never know unless more documentation comes out. I would also make a strong suggestion that the lenses sent to Berlin in 1941 were not coated. It is entirely reasonable to assume that the coating that Zeiss had developed during this time was ordered to be used on the production Summarex lenses. The increase in performance over a non-coated lens would have been very noticeable. This would in itself certainly account for some of the time that elapsed between delivery of prototype lenses to Berlin and actual production lenses being delivered. I have not seen the entries for the lenses in 1941. It would be interesting to see if they had the \"B\" designation and what the code for these lenses was.

While the Summicron may have a focal length of 51,5 or even 52mm, the Tri-Elmar in its 50mm position is more like 48mm. I am only mentioning this to make clear that even relatively small differences in focal length will show on slides or negatives. You are of course correct in that there may have been some variation in focal length between lenses, but those variations will be within 1 or 1.5mm for any given lens type at most. If as UliWer says the Summarex lenses have a focal length of roughly 84mm, then there is no way that variation between lenses will result in a focal length close to 90mm. Andy I was not ignoring the French article. I was making a general point about the actual focal lengths of Leica lenses being different to the indicated lengths. This variation was probably likely to increase in mms as the indicated focal length increased. None of us know what the situation actually was. If I remember correctly the French lens was altered in later years. What is needed is a completely unaltered lens marked 9cm from 1941 for examination. Hen\u2019s teeth come to mind on this one. All we know is that the military rejected a 9cm lens and then accepted an 8.5cm lens. We have no idea why that was so. There has been a lot of speculation here, but nothing that would represent definitive proof.

The first lens is the Canon 800mm f/8.0 S-Set lens sold for Canon rangefinders. Initially it had a built-in reflex housing and then used Canon's Mirror Box I and Mirror Box II reflex housings. The particular lens I listed as Model 2 in Canon's catalog and as Type 4 in Peter Kitchingman's categorization. The lens is a doublet achromat and was designed in about 1954. The Model 2 lens is bellows focused. The number produced is unknown. It was replaced by the Canon 800mm f/8.0 FL, a Sonnar derivative, in 1971 for their SLRs; it was not available for Canon's rangefinder cameras as Canon's last rangefinder camera had gone out of production in 1968. The second lens is the Nikon 800mm f/8.0 Nikkor-P lens. It is a Ernostar / Sonnar design released in 1964; -P means five glass elements. Cooper and Abbott (Nikon's equivalent of Morgan and Lester) says this lens is an apochromat. The lens is part of a modular family; a single focusing mount can be used for 400mm f/4.5, 600mm f/5.6, 800mm f/8.0 and 1200mm f/11.0 lens heads. After 1424 were produced, the 800mm f/8.0 Nikkor-P lens was replaced in 1975 by the 800mm f/8.0 ED Nikkor (88 produced); then by the 800mm f/8.0 ED-IF Nikkor (1132 produced) with 9 elements in three (front, middle, rear) sections. To test the lenses I used a lens test chart (43 x 56 cm). I used a Nikon D5 because it is the only digital camera I have that can mount all three lenses and has a electronic focus confirmation. An electronic shutter release cable was used. The D5 can be set to raise the mirror with a first shutter release and then trip the shutter with a second shutter release. These lenses are hard to hold steady. The Canon and the Telyt have two tripod mounts; the Nikon has one tripod mount but is a more compact lens, being a true telephoto. I used two tripods for the lenses that have two mounts. The primary tripod was a Gitzo GT4552TS carbon fiber tripod. It is meant to hold the largest and heaviest telephoto lenses from Canon and Nikon. I used a Wimberley WH-200 gimbal head on the Gitzo tripod. The Wimberley head is impeccable. It moves easily, without sticking or play and allows perfect balance making the lens with camera seem weightless. The second tripod was a Bogen 3020 aluminum tripod with a ball head. The Bogen 3020 tripod can also hold substantial weight. As you might expect, using two tripods is a real challenge. It would not be usable for sports or wildlife. The Canon lens has to be handled gingerly because of the bellows and the lens construction which has a thinly threaded joint in the middle of the lens which is prone to stripping. The Nikon lens is the most compact of the three and most solidly built. You can haul the thing around without concern. The biggest limitation of the Nikon lens is the focusing mount which is used for four different focal length lens heads. The longer the lens, the more focusing mount travel is needed to focus the lens.. The closest focusing distance that can be achieved for the 800mm lens is about 20 meters. In comparison the Telyt focuses to about 12 meters. To get the Nikkor to close-focus, I used an extension tube which caused vignetting. The cantilevered weight of the 800mm lens head also causes the to bind slightly. The results are attached. In addition to showing the test chart itself, I superimposed the histogram for the test chart in the lower right. Color fringing can be seen in the histogram, and is particularly noticeable with the Canon lens. The tightness of the spikes is representative of the sharpness. The clear optical winner is the Telyt.

The 35mm lens you used is an excellent performer. I think a warning is in order here. You already have one foot down the rabbit hole. If you purchase a Leica M body to go with your lenses you'll be all the way down and there's no climbing back out. I noticed a couple of things in your comments that need clarification. You mentioned that you used the monochrome setting but also that the images were captured as NEF (Nikon Raw). A raw file would be unaffected by this setting. When you use the monochrome setting, only the jpeg is affected. The raw file would still open as a color image and would need to be converted. Perhaps you had your camera set to capture both NEF and jpeg? The other thing that caught my attention was that you said you weren't concerned about vignetting because the lenses would be used wide open and never at apertures smaller than f8. Vignetting is most pronounced at the wide open apertures and diminishes as you stop down, not the reverse. Cheers! Brent Thank you for the compliments. Yes that Leica 35mm Summilux-M is one excellent lens. I'm finding that even after 30 years in the business to be as precise as possible these lenses have a learning curve. You are also correct about the NEF and the Monochrome setting made in camera as the Monochrome setting only affects the jpeg; but what I did do with the contrast globally was match the color NEF file to the jpeg for my final image. I'm sure that if I work with the Adjustment Brush in ACR I can selectively make the image pop more but these tests are just the beginning as I've only had this lens for about a month and finding subject matter to do tests with is difficult with the pandemic. You are correct as well regarding the vignetting of this lens; but this is part of the character of the lens, and I love that character. I want my background to be as swirly as possible so I'm not going to shoot these lenses any lower than f2.8 unless I'm in the studio using studio lighting and even then if I do stop down I'll use ACR to drop in a slight vignette. I want my imagery to be high quality and I'm happy to continue this dialogue as it will help me understand the system better. Thank you very much for your input, I appreciate the feedback.

Obviously the title was meant to be humorous (unless you think a food cart thug is actually a thing).

His 2016 retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, Daido Tokyo, showed both color and B&W prints. Actually, while still shooting film, Moriyama occasionally published color and B&W prints of the same color negative. Ralph Gibson, turned to color in 1991, when he published L'Histoire de France, and has continued to shoot both color and B&W, though lately mainly color. We all know that some images only work in color and some only in B&W, but some work both ways. I tend to shoot in \"binges\" with my M10, with the intent of color for a month or so, followed by a period with the intent of B&W.

This ring, which is to allow spectacles and non spectacles wearers to view at the optimum distance, is so loose, that just putting your eye to the ocular, shuts the ring down into the body of the ocular, to the spectacles position. As for distance, I am a non-spectacles wearer, this is irritating and I have made a temporary cure of putting a pair of O rings round the stem of the eyepiece.

Here a little expertise is needed to understand the rather complex mechanism. The long arm that connects the shaft at the front of the projector to the left of the lens looking down to the square plate on the slide change is just a pin connecting the arm to the square plastic plate (this is the one you unscrewed?). This is just flixable enough to gently lift enough to let the engaging pin clear the square plate (just a matter of three of four mm or so), at which point you can check if the plate will move along the two chrome rods that hold it in place (to the left side as in your photo), which will indicate if it is the slide change part (the plate) that is jammed or if it is something on the underside.

In addition to all my backups, I would love to have another one with EVERYTHING I have (so far, it's 6/7 TB).

Scanning color film generally produces good results. But that is not true for conventional B&W materials. I completely disagree with this, at least for me. Maybe it's true for others. My small amount of experience with scanning Ilford 100 B&W certainly did not create very grainy results. Second, as I see it, for B&W film, the grain IS the image - it's not like digital, where noise (looks like grain) messes up an image. If you wrote scanning CAN produce results like that, I wouldn't argue, but I've found a way to avoid that issue. I have no idea yet how scanning my 35mm color negatives will work out - I decided I would start with B&W, which I feel is more of a challenge. Regarding good scans, while I agree someone might find that \"conventional B&W materials\" don't scan very well, I haven't seen that as an issue at all. With all the controls available to me with a scanned image, processing it in DxO PhotoLab4, I have infinitely more control than I ever had in my darkroom..... which might very well be because I didn't understand printing as well as I understand my computer photo editing software, and even that is limited, as people are constantly showing me things I didn't know before, such as @jaapv in showing me how to make an image appear sharper in Topaz AI Sharpen.

Silver prints made in a darkroom cannot equal or exceed the tonal range inherent in a negative (or positive). Every time one copies an analog original (the negative) some detail must be lost (as opposed to digital copies). So why would you copy an inferior sample if a superior one is available? In my professional career I have operated a darkroom with three differing enlargers as part of my work and I know from producing not thousands, but millions of B/W prints that all the negative data cannot be collected together on one print. The look of a B/W print made in a darkroom can be very special, but it does not contain all the negative data. At best it is an optical illusion. THe Callier Effect! On your advice I started reading about it. Frankly my opinion, based on real life experience, is that it has no real application in practice. The fact that diffusion enlargers also use film containing silver must also have some scatter effect. The highlighting of grain is a creative tool used by skillful photographers and has no need to be avoided. Indeed, some deliberately use high speed films because of their grain. Using XP2 does give a different outcome, but from my monitoring of this forum, most use it as a meas of facilitating labs to process their B/W films rather than do it themselves. Not as a means of avoiding grain. The fact is, I prefer the look of a filmic image at times. Otherwise I shoot digital. Everyone must make their own judgments for themselves, but, I suggest, should not for others First of all, the print is the final product, and the negative is only an intermediate stage. Anyone who has been doing B&W photography long soon learns what works best. The Callier effect is quite obvious when switching between diffusion and condenser enlargers. I own an enlarger (Fujimoto G70) that has both types of illumination: you flip the head to change from condenser to diffusion. I did some testing when I acquired it, and there is a considerable difference in contrast. Roughly a grade and a half. http://www.jollinger.com/photo/enlargers/fujimoto.html Diffusion enlargers require higher-contrast negatives to achieve the same print contrast, all else being equal. This increases the graininess of the print; in fact, it increases the graininess more than using the condenser enlarger with a somewhat less contrasty negative. I repeat: obvious graininess is not normal when using proper materials and techniques. I made 16 x 20 prints from Tri-X using UFG developer 50 years ago that hardly show grain! Delta 100 should produce prints that have no evident graininess at all unless badly mishandled.

I need a scanner for 35mm and overall it seems like a really good choice ? I'm completely new to scanning by the way I flat out love it! I have nothing negative (??) to say about it - only how glad I am that I found it. It is relatively small, solid, easy to use, portable, quiet, and if it has any flaws, I can't find them. My scanned images (only negatives so far, no slides) look better than I ever expected. So far, I don't like that it cost $100 more ($500) than had it not come with the scanning software, and again, so far, I'm just using VueScan, but sometime soon I should try out the included \"Silverfast 9\" which was a free upgrade from the version 8 that came with the scanner. I installed it, so it's ready for use, but I'm so comfortable with VueScan that it wasn't really needed - although it might be better than VueScan. I dunno. I ordered it from B&H Photo, as I wanted to check it out in case I didn't like it - but quickly fell in love with it. It is effortless to use. If you're new to scanning, the most difficult thing is learning the scanning software. Eventually it all makes sense, but there was a time when I had no idea what the choices were - but YouTube videos, along with feedback I got in the DxO PhotoLab forum, quickly had me up to speed.

In my estimation it is two stops off. I'm not sure what is two stops off, the 'story' or a photo, but if there is one thing that is worse than 'old wives' tales' it is 'old fellas' certainties' or even 'young fellas' certainties' like Harry Enfield's TV pub bore character who prefaced every one of his pronouncements with \"what you ought to do is\". 2 hours ago, 250swb said: I agree, of course it is nonsense, unless you want to get the very most out of Leica lenses precision isn't necessary. But read back through the replies to this thread and the greater nonsense is the Sunny 16 system, or should it be Sunny 11, or Sunny 8? The photographer doesn't need a light meter, but to use Sunny 16 they do need a device to find their latitude on the Earth, and I'm not sure sextants have yet caught on with photographers as much as they should have. Well OK they know they aren't standing on a sunny Californian beach when it's raining in Dublin, but rather than codify something that doesn't work how about using a realistic non-reverential term like 'guesswork'? At least guesswork acknowledges that results can go either way, unlike Sunny 16 which formalises a system to ensure the results go either way. Sunny 16 is good enough to record Aunty Ethel on her annual Summer holiday at each end of a roll of 36 and with Christmas Day frames 15 to 24. But the people it was intended for wouldn't know why the picture was grainy, dark, or too light, they just knew something must have gone wrong but aren't photographers supposed to be better than that? The Sunny 16 thing was always meant to be only a guide and an intelligent person would have no trouble in figuring that out. So, so-called 'sunny days' in Dublin, Durban or Delhi may vary enormously as regards light level and the intelligent photographer will work around that. In one of my posts above I made the old Irish joke about there being 4 seasons in every day, which is , of course, very often not a joke where I live. Let's leave Aunty Ethel out of this. If she was happy with her photographs then we should leave her alone. If she is not happy then we might give her a small piece of advice, but we should not feel superior about her Christmas and holiday photos which will mean more to her than all of the photos on this site laid end to end. As for 'we photographers' it is up to each one of us to work out what works for us, even if that is tautology. I still see posts here from people wondering why their auto exposure photos with their latest 'digi-wonder' cameras are under or overexposed. A little run around Sunny 16 or the history of photography before light meters would do them no harm. Just to amuse you all, here is the front of one of my VPK cameras. The shutter bit on top goes 25, B, T and 50. It also has writing below about 'Clear and Brilliant' and also 'Tripod', 'Gray 1/2 Sec' , Dull 1/4 Sec' and 'Very DL'. The aperture bit at the bottom, as well as reading 1.2, 3, 4, goes 'Portrait', Near View, Average View and Clouds Marine, which would appear to relate to distance rather than exposure. The manual for the VPK references these settings, but makes no reference to film speed which would have been way below the modern equivalent of ISO 10 ( ISO/ASA did not exist back then) and I had to interpret this when shooting with modern ISO 100 film. So the user of a VPK may have followed the instructions in the manual and on the camera in a fashion not unlike the way that photographers used the Sunny 16 thing much later on. Many millions of successful photos were taken this way. The second photo below is one of my shots from the VPK , which, in a sense, represents my mental interpretation of the ancestor of Sunny 16.

So yeah, you can go all-digital and avoid paying film costs, but do the math and go in with eyes wide open, you may find that you won't really be saving any money. That goes off the original topic because I mentioned the (hopefully not occurring) example of film prices going through the roof. Couple points here as reply to your points raised which might have led to the wrong impression: 1. I agree that alternative 35 film cameras still can be obtained for a good value - I never questioned or raised this point. I also agree that new digital cameras have gone up in value (less quantity sold making an increased price for a new digital full-frame based one). You can shoot a lot of film for this kind of price. I have stopped buying new digital cameras since > 10 years and only buy used after the main value was depreciated. Last year I got a nearly mint M-E 240 for less than $2K which I plan to use for along time in parallel to older digital cameras I own and multiple film cameras (large, medium, and small format). 2. I am not part of any subscription based PP software and won't be. I am still using my old PS CS6 and LR 5.5. I have moved since to the freeware Darktable replacing LR for the most part. As backup system I am using a 20 TB LaCie harddrive which I set up as 2x 10 TB mirror image. I am not storing images on any cloud-based system - I have Google Drive for free space but only use it for random cellphone photos I rarely take. So no cost for PP or storage in my case. 3. I have 4 enlargers (Beseler types) which I set up for printing from large, medium, and small negative sizes. I often make darkroom prints which I exhibit and hang in my own place. I also use the hybrid process called digital negative - using digital files and making silver gelatin prints from it. No need to lecture me about printing as you might be able to tell from this short paragraph. My point earlier was simply that I am not going for exorbitant film prices as mentioned. I believe there will be moderate/cheaper based film stocks for a long time to come which I will continue to be using (currently I am using Ilford B&W films which I roll myself from 100' rolls as mentioned earlier which brings the cost of 36-frame film roll down to about $4).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/324182-lina-bessonova-et-al-restarting-adox-film-production/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4269814", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "324182-lina-bessonova-et-al-restarting-adox-film-production", "result": true, "Selector": "i can make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " 16 hours ago, logan2z said: this has been discussed a lot online already, but it's not necessarily clear that shooting digital is less expensive than shooting film. leaving leica to the side for a second, used film cameras can be bought for next to nothing these days. even a good quality prosumer camera like a nikon fm and a 50mm f2 nikon lens can be had for about $150. even in the case of inflated leica m film camera prices, an m3 or m2 can be had for under $2k. a decent m10 or equivalent is going to cost you closer to $5k, although you could pick up a sony or a fuji for quite a bit less. how about depreciation of digital cameras?

Vuescan's built in so-called profiles are, to use a technical term, rubbish (imho). I read somewhere (on the internet, so it must be true lol) that they are actually some old Kodak Image Disc profiles that Ed Hamrick included. I typically shoot a pretty wide range of b&w \u2013 XP2, TMX, Fomapan, Double-X, Tri-X to name a few \u2013 but scan them all with the same settings. It's the same with the other two emulsion types, though I usually mainly shoot a few different film types of c41 and transparency. I do the same in Flexcolor for my X1 actually, three simple profiles. All that said, everyone can set up the scanning software like the want to of course.

My eyes can't see any loss of resolution. Using PL4's \"control points\" I not only made the snow lighter, but I found I could bring out the details underneath the engine. Changes from when I started on these images include changing the PL4 \"preset\" to Black & White, along with using \"control points\" for local corrections to the image. Gee, I wonder how this might compare to what I could do with a Leica Monochrom camera? One thing is for sure, I didn't have the skill to accomplish this in my old darkroom.

I shoot quite a lot of film with my M6, both colour and BW. Its on the way back (in the post) with a viewfinder upgrade and CLA so looking forward to giving it a good run feeding it lots more film. I\u2019ve a B+W F- Pro orange filter that I use a little and I\u2019d like to add to this. Specifically a green filter for BW portraits, to experiment on my young surfer son who\u2019s seven with some cute freckles. Also, for colour negative, typically with Portra, I\u2019d like to get my hands on warming and cooling filters to try and get more consistent results and minimise colour shifts. This is particularly relevant as finding a good local scanner operator is a challenge; it\u2019s not an excuse, just another reason to try and minimise any requirement for corrections at the scanner, i note Leica make some black and white filters, including a green filter, so that would likely cover off my requirement for BW, however, I\u2019m stumped for warming and cooling filters, particularly in the 39mm size. I tried a camera store this afternoon to see what they may be able to get and was advised they\u2019re unable to help me as there\u2019s little need these days with digital; fair enough. Most ideally too, I\u2019d like nice brass filters like the B+W F-Pro series, they\u2019re very nicely made bits of kit. As I\u2019d like to keep the setup compact, I don\u2019t wish to use step downs or larger filters, I\u2019d like to stick with 39mm.

So far my order of preference for 35 mm B&W film is as follows (top being my preference): HP5+ 400: found it the best compromise so far between sharpness and amount of grain. Use a two-step development method with Rodinal (1:100) and Xtol here to achieve the best outcome. XP2: uses C-41 process for development, but sharpness is superb, it can be used at different ISO on the same film. Very low in grain. Sort of digital look. TMax films: what I really dislike about them is the purple dye wash-off. A pain in the neck! Tri-X: I have tried many attempts to like this film. But I simply don't. No matter which developer I use, it gives too much grain. Advantage of it: it can be nicely pushed to high ISO. Delta 3600: I tried it, and I won't use it again. The same high ISO can be better achieved with pushed Tri-X if really needed. Too expensive for what it delivers, too. Just my 2 Cents, personal preferences might vary. And yes, before all the comments come like \"HP5+ is as good as Tri-X\", I certainly don't agree here. IMO HP5+ is steps ahead, and Tri-X lives by its reputation from its old time.

We actually made a first test washing too little and washing correctly, in various steps. And we tested running water washing versus just changing the prints to a tray with clean water. We always used trays that were one size up from the paper format. All in all it took most of a week . . . I can't remember the details, but I do remember the results affected the workflow. Everything we printed in the morning was actively washed (changing between two trays with water) until lunch. Then we'd leave the prints in not running water.

Building on what I learned from the first pack, I: - Printed photographs of people, landscape and nature, avoiding buildings and manmade objects. - Looked at how well borderless printing works. - Looked at how well the thin papers stood up to dense coloured images (lots of ink), as well as sparse images with lots of light background. - Printed on both sides of the Inbe Thin paper; although not marked on the pack as suitable for double sided, I'd seen remarks online that the Inbe paper was designed for double sided. Further conclusions: - Borderless printing presented no problems (I didn't expect any, but worth checking). - The Murakumo Kozo Select thin papers held ink well (dark blue image of man in the centre, and B&W girl singing top right corner) showed the image on the reverse, but with little obvious lateral seepage. The Kozo Thin papers showed even less (landscape with two rocky islands, centre left, two dancing couples, top centre). - The Inbe Thin White, which I printed double sided with dense coloured images (girl in the red jacket, centre right) showed no obvious sign of the images on the respective reverses. Common sense says this needs further examination, but if it remains the case, then this looks like a good paper for photobooks. - The double layered papers remain challenging, both to peel and mount. My experience from the first batch was repeated: the Mitsumata White Double Layered (landscape of Helvellyn, bottom left) was fairly easy to separate with care. The Kozo Double Layered is tricky and easy to tear as you start to peel, and remains curled (lovers in dark red, bottom right). I understand these papers are designed to be made into Japanese hanging scrolls. - I tried two different image types with the Unryu paper (the one with the waferboard-like surface texture). A borderless print of a wildflower garden (top right): the paper pattern was lost entirely; I can see no benefit to this paper for such an all-over image. The clunky vignette of pink plants (lower left): the paper adds something here because the texture is visible in the un-inked or light colour parts. This is not really the sort of photography I do, but I can see a benefit to the paper here. - Generalising from the foregoing conclusion, all these papers show themselves at their best where the texture of the paper can be seen. I would be inclined to print dense colour images with a large border, or use these papers for images where there are plenty of light areas. - I don't think I have examined B&W landscapes particularly well here, though I included several (all given a similar high key, high contrast treatment). It's not a type of photography I do much of and I doubt that I am particularly good at processing them for printing on western paper, let alone these Japanese papers. So will I buy some more?

I have two, 90 2.0 pre APO and 35 Asph and 35 2.0 V4 which is only used on my M8. I could replace them but the 35 is super expensive and not generally available yet. The 90 was bought new when it first came out in 198X and it has spent 99.9% of 40 years in storage with smaller lighter lenses taken more often. It is is as new mint condition. The 50 APO spoiled me so now I have to make a decision. It was decided to experiment with digital. Capture One is now my preferred program but PS or perhaps Lightroom could do similar. Assume a perfect picture that only needs sharpening. Open a new layer from M10 or M10R and add a circular graduated mask leaving the center untouched. With Adobe PS, turn off sharpening in ACR and work in PS. Make the graduations round, not elliptical as lenses make round images. Add some sharpening at 100%. Move the navigation tool from center to corner and adjust so they are the same sharpness. Do your first of normal three step sharpening on a NEW layer, The edges now show same sharpness across the frame for high/normal contrast objects. Keep in mind sharpening will not produce detail that was not captured, but for most images with high contrast objects, they are reproduced much better.

These are being sold by Cobalt-Image as a DNG Pack for each camera: there are also emulation packs for various sets of films and for for various sets of films, that run on top of the DNG Packs. It\u2019s worthwhile to read a long thread on this on the Fred Miranda Forum, which has comparisons of various profiles and emulations presets \u2014 and in which one of the Cobalt-Image people (\u201cUlysseit\u201d) has been responding to questions. The Cobalt-Image website is here. At this stage I have only bought the basic DNG profiles for my M10, and am waiting to see what the forthcoming Kodak film pack will be like. However, in the Fred Miranda thread you can see comparisons of some of the film emulation as well as camera emulations. There are some remarkable examples in the thread of M9 emulations as well as emulations of both CCD and CMOS Monochrom files. An interesting example is a M9 B&W JPG emulation in a normal and high-contrast version. @adan has posted about how he achieves, or improves upon, the M9 look with his M10: the Cobalt M9 color emulations may be an easier way to do that, at least for people who are less skilled than adan. The Cobalt film emulations look like they are a lot more accurate than any of the older profile/preset packages available. @evikne has written about his satisfaction with RNI profile/presets: that doesn't match my experience with RNI, and the Cobalt ones seem to look a lot better. Some photographers use the Cobalt camera emulations for achieving essentially the same look from two different cameras: say, you have a Sony and a Fujifilm camera and want to have the Fujifilm colors from both cameras \u2014 as well as the various JPG film simulations that the Fujifilm digital cameras are famous for. I'm not going to post any profile comparisons, as there is so much of that in the Fred Miranda thread. Below are a few images that I posted recently that were shot is such difficult light that, previously, I only used B&W versions, but that now I like in terms of the color I get using the Cobalt DNG profiles. M10 | Summaron-M 1:5.6/28 | ISO 3200 | f/5.6 | 1/180 sec | Chiang Mai--img--  M10 | DR Summicron 50 | ISO 3200 | f/4.0 | 1/750 | Chiang Mai--img--  M10 | Summaron-M 1:5.6/28 | ISO 1600 | f/5.6 | 1/350 sec | Bangkok--img--  Here is another image that I've only used in B&W, and for which the Cobalt profile is useful. I'm interested in shooting directly into noon-day tropical light and how the light can be so strong that it \"bleeds\". (This one requires double-clicking to get a better view.) M10 | Summaron-M 1:5.6/28 | ISO 200 | f/5.6 | 1/60 sec | Chiang Mai--img--  Although I was previously happy with this image using the M10 profile in Lightroom, it works better with the Cobalt profile because the red in the sign on the top of the building is more accurate here. As I said, often the Adobe Standard/Color and the M10 profiles are similar to the Cobalt images. However that is image-specific: for example, when an images had s a lot of reds and yellows, the Cobalt profiles are substantially more accurate on both colors.M10 | DR Summicron 50 | ISO 200 | f/4.0 | 1/180 | Tokyo--img--  Of following image, taken at sunset, I posted elsewhere a version that I made using a complicated \"recipe\" in ColorEfex. The following was processed more simply using a Cobalt profile. As mentioned in the earlier post in the Summaron 28 thread, I was shooting a good number of color landscapes in this area of Northern Thailand with the Summaron 28, both digitally with the M10 and with film (Portra 400), and coming to the conclusion that this lens simply rendered better with film. Someone on LUF commented that film gave better \u201ccolor depth\u201d. Like the ColerEfex version, this new Cobalt version made me think differently about that. (As usual of LUF, click on the image for better resolution.) @Steven - I think you could find the Cobalt profiles interesting, especially if you end up buying the Summaron 28.

I use C1 v20, so now I'm thinking if I shall upgrade to C1 v21 before buying these profiles or after. Based on Cobalt homapage info I'm not sure profiles work in all C1 versions as they state they need to prepare tailor made versions. Need to ask Ulysetta.

I used the S006 for years and loved the color (primarily with a custom profiling), but when I got the S3 I did not like the Adobe Color profile at all, as it seemed to be \"graded\", rather than neutral. It has what feels like clarity applied, as well as tweaks to shadow saturation and highlight gradation. Basically, to my eyes it is a mess. Custom profiles I made help, but then the shadows show magenta casts and certain extreme tones have weird gamut issues. I think that is a limitation imposed by my use of amateur profiling equipment (color checker passport etc). Adobe now seems to be tying certain noise reduction to their profiles, or at least correcting for more than just colors. C1's profiles are better, and in general the camera looks better in C1 than Lightroom, but I am tied to lightroom for work/workflow reasons. So. I bought the Cobalt profiles, and I think the starting point is significantly nicer than Adobe. The files are not as saturated, and the colors are more natural. When pushed, the shadows hold up better than my custom profiles did, and in line with Adobe, but without the strange adobe grading. Greens in particular look better, where they were often bordering on brown with the Adobe profiles. All in all, I think these are a helpful addition, and the price of entry was not significant to me in relation to the time saved. I am still not sure about the repro profile...I had hoped that would be the true neutral that I was looking for, but it presents as at least a stop and a half underexposed, so I am not sure what is up with that. I will say however, that even if what I am describing sounds like a massive difference, it is not. It is subtle, but to me quite important. I found that it was difficult to undo what Abobe had wrought with their weird profile...hard to walk back the gradation changes and seemingly tone and shade specific saturation adjustments. The Cobalt profile seems to bring me back to a nice neutral, which is much more desirable than the solution adobe provided for the camera.

That makes sense, and in reading a bit about linear profiles, it makes more sense. I have used RPP, mostly to rescue otherwise very challenging negatives. I found it useful for situations where gamut clipping causes harsh tonal transitions, or when a different method of bayer dematrixing might remove a bothersome noise pattern or moire etc. But like you I found it too complicated and ergonomically difficult to bother with. It is a program of last resort for me. To be honest, even C1 feels like that to me. As much as I am not a fan of a number of Adobe's corporate practices and some of their decisions regarding processing, I find that Lightroom and Photoshop are still light years ahead of the other companies in terms of workflow. Since I manage my business through Lightroom as well, using another processor just because it has slightly better results is impractical. I am glad that these profiles can adjust the baseline colors while still providing the same quality of noise handling etc. As for custom profiles, I have made a lot of them over the years, but I am not an expert. I think in order to make truly high quality profiles you need to do more than just photograph charts in the right lighting. I noticed in my custom profiles for my printing business that I was unable to achieve the same DMax using the i1 Pro2 that the printer could do when printing using AdobeRGB simulation. This was particularly true for matte papers. What I suspect is the issue is flare or reflectivity from the lamp in the spectrophotometer. When reading the darkest patches, the light shining off the patch to make it readable artificially brightens the density value, so when the profile is generated, that black reads as greyer than it actually is. It is quite visible even in the gamut plots that you can look at in ColorSync. I think the true profiling professionals have access to equipment to account for this, or at least have the knowledge to go into the profiles and manually adjust for this. At this stage, I find that often just converting to Adobe RGB in photoshop and printing as AdobeRGB in the printer yields the best results...I am not alone in this...Ctein was the one who put me onto it in the first place.

In short: in DNG profile editor the base profile is mandatory the DNG is optional Adam That's correct and thanks for pointing it out. However to choose a base prifile (other than from a DNG image) you have to know where Lightroom stores its Camara Profiles or you have to make your own from a DNG image, because as far as I know to make your .dcp file you need to use a DNG file. This will however, also have associated with it the embedded profiles chosen by the Camera Manufacture as the DNGs you use to create the colour checker profile will already have these embeded in it, so you are still using a DNG. However for those less computer literate or who do not have the ability to make there own .dcp files then if you open a DNG from the camera you are creating a Linear Profile for it will list the profiles already associated with the DNG. You can then choose which of these to use as your Base Profile before switching to the Tone Curve tab and selecting Linear. If you look at the image window of the DNG you will see the results of the changes you have selected. As such you could work your way through all of the embeded profiles and decide which you believe gives you the results you want for your new Linear Profile.

I don't understand your question. It makes sense to me that when Leica ships a new camera, all the calibration and adjustments are already done and \"correct\". By calibrating the screen, I assume that I will see the information coming from the camera, which should be correct. So far, so good. But if I want to print my image, the printer needs to be calibrated too, and if I post my image here, in the forum, people may see the image very differently based on the calibration of the screens they are using to view the image. I haven't calibrated my own screen on the ASUS for several months. The last time I did check it, it was still at the correct settings. Maybe I should be doing that once a month as mentioned earlier. Back to my question, if I post an image here in this forum, presumably those of you who have calibrated screens will be more likely to see an accurate view of my image, but I'm guessing at least 3/4 of the people reading this are using whatever screen they happen to have handy at the moment, and if it's an Apple iMac, they are probably not seeing the image \"correctly\" because the iMac computers make the screen overly bright by default. Anyway, what did you mean by the highlighted text in my quote? Out of camera files are not necessarily \u2018correct\u2019; they are just one interpretation, which is then again managed by conversion software, with myriad other possibilities through use of custom camera profiles (potentially combined with new default import settings and/or presets), editing controls, etc. This very thread topic is about creating a custom camera profile using a ColorChecker. Cameras with high dynamic range, as another example, often have \u2018flat\u2019 files out of camera, based on a mostly linear contrast curve. The user can adjust that tone curve in a matter of seconds, dramatically altering contrast, color saturation, etc. Leica and Adobe added a modest S curve through an update to the M10 Monochrom, after users complained (with apparent lack of understanding) about dull out of camera files. Film stocks had built in characteristic curves; digital is far more flexible for users. Just as users can adjust screen contrast and brightness, so too can they adjust image file contrast, both at the import stage and thereafter. If there were just one \u2018correct\u2019 file version for each camera model, everyone using that camera would generate similar looking files and output. How boring that would be.

After reading your post, I lost interest in the idea - since it's not possible, why beat my head against a brick wall. I'm in no way \"dismissing\" your thoughts, I'm just \"accepting\" them. I never wanted to create custom camera profiles - I just wanted to know if Leica makes them all the same. Big difference. Thank you for pointing out that I was going down a dead-end street.

Paper profiles at the print stage are another link in the color management chain. And so forth. Not wasted time at all, at any stage. The added point I made at the end, however, is that you shouldn't conclude, just because you calibrate YOUR monitor, that everybody else is necessarily seeing precisely the same thing on THEIR monitor.

This is one of the reasons I have not been interested in replacing my M10 by the M10-R or M10-M. A future M11 could tempt me if it could render highlights more like negative film does, so that, when shooting into the light or with strong sidelight, you don't have to underexpose (expose to for the highlights) and lift shadows as much as you have to with the M10. However, my feeling is that Leica could achieve much of this by an M10 firmware upgrade \u2014 by applying a different curve to the DNG files that would distribute the available dynamic range more evenly between highlights and shadows: currently more of the dynamic range goes to the shadows than to the highlights. This would produce a lower contrast, flatter file. For people who want straight out of camera images, Leica could provide JPGs like those of the Ricoh GR III (like \"Hi-Contrast B&W\" and \"Positive Film\"): also, these JPG presets are are highly adjustable in-camera by the user, providing great flexibility, somewhat like having your own version of a film. To put all this into context, consider that Daido Moriyama \u2014 who regularly, exhibits large prints of 150x100cm (60x40 inches) \u2014 currently shoots, according to Japanese websites, with a Nikon Coolpix, a discontinued P&S camera with a 1/ 2.3 inch sensor, 16 MP, and a 25-500mm EFOV zoom lens that produces only JPGs. Here is a quote from a January 2021 article on a Japanese website: \"I once interviewed Daido Moriyama about the Ricoh GR. The last thing he said to me was \"Akagi-san, when you meet someone from Ricoh, tell them to put a zoom lens on the GR\". I asked him, 'What?'. Then, when I asked him why he said with a wry smile, \"Because a zoom lens is convenient.\" Well, there was no way I could argue with a legend of the photography world...By the way, Daido Moriyama's favorite camera now is the COOLPIX S7000. If you are interested in it, please look it up [laugh].\" \u2014 Incidentally, one of the things that Moriyama likes about digital cameras is the possibility of using both color and B&W versions of shots, ________________________ Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/320321-show-us-your-mad-skills-m10-bw-conversions/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4201140", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "320321-show-us-your-mad-skills-m10-bw-conversions", "result": true, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "-----> i !!!  thought -----> i !!!

With RGB each channel is divided into 255 levels whereas in LAB each channel is divided into plus and minus 100 levels. Personally I find working with + or - 100 much simpler than fractions of 255 but I accept that YMMV. Certainly, becoming familiar with working in LAB colour space takes some effort and perseverance but it yields significant rewards, superior results, and ease of use not only in colour manipulation but also in sharpening, dodging, burning, noise reduction, and tonal manipulation because luminance information is completely separate from colour information and therefore altering one doesn't affect the other as it inevitably will in RGB... Pete - Yup, that's at the heart of it. Bruce Fraser (for RGB) and Dan Margulis (for LAB) had a long discussion on these issues around 2008. Have a look at a post by Andrew Rodney, which you can see by scrolling down in this page. Rodney has a long quote from Fraser, that is worth reading in its entirety, beginning with: Let me make it clear that I'm not adamantly opposed to Lab workflows. If they work for you, that's great, and you should continue to use them. My concern is that Lab has been oversold, and that naive users attribute to it an objective correctness that it does not deserve...and ending with Rodney's statement: It's [LAB] been way over sold, especially if you're working with Raw files in a good Raw processor. Using those tools should (and I would love to see the Lab proponents prove otherwise) diminish the need for Lab to about nill. Its a non intuitive space to work in numerically. There's data loss and time lost going from space to space. It brings little if anything to the party that a good RGB working space can accomplish after proper use of RGB data in good Raw processor. Way back, in 1998, Bruce picked up on a post I had made in the CompuServe Photo forum about problems that I had trying to print B&W without color casts on the huge and hugely expensive Fujifilm Pictrography 4000 laser printer. When asked Fujifilm whether they could make a B&W profile for this printer they simply said that this was a color printer. Bruce was interested in the issues with making such a profile and offered to try to do it: quite an offer to do it for free, for his business was consulting on issues of this type. Over six months we exchanged emails and phone calls, and I sent prints to Bruce by courier. In the process, Bruce found some issues with ColorSync, on which he then corresponded with Adobe; as well as issues with some of the software that we used, although I don't recall what it was, and had me speak to the developers. The upshot was that the color cast issues could not be solved with a profile: whatever Bruce did turned out to be image specific, working on one image but still producing color casts on other images. The solution had to be for Fujifilm to build in a B&W capacity into the printer firmware. Incidentally, I had hung a few prints from this printer on a wall in Bangkok, and two moths later they had turned green in the tropical heat and humidity \u2014 I didn't need to ask about a Wilhelm archival rating! Luckily, I managed to sell the printer, to someone who needed it for printing proofs and was not concerned with archival quality, for a couple of hundred dollars less than I bought it for. Bruce Fraser was an extremely nice person and, sadly, died of lung cancer at a relatively young age. ________________________Frog Leaping photobook Edited May 9 by Nowhereman", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/320568-msl2-colors/?tab=comments#comment-4197590", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "320568-msl2-colors", "result": true, "Selector": "me make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "2 hours ago, farnz said: that's a surprising view to me since dan margulis's book is about working in lab colour space as opposed to rgb colour space. with rgb each channel is divided into 255 levels whereas in lab each channel is divided into plus and minus 100 levels. personally i find working with + or - 100 much simpler than fractions of 255 but i accept that ymmv. certainly, becoming familiar with working in lab colour space takes some effort and perseverance but it yields significant rewards, superior results, and ease of use not only in colour manipulation but also in sharpening, dodging, burning, noise reduction, and tonal manipulation because luminance information is completely separate from colour information and therefore altering one doesn't affect the other as it inevitably will in rgb... pete - yup, that's at the heart of it. bruce fraser (for rgb) and dan margulis (for lab) had a long discussion on these issues around 2008. have a look at a post by andrew rodney, which you can see by scrolling down in this page. rodney has a long quote from fraser, that is worth reading in its entirety, beginning with: let -----> me !!!  -----> make !!!  it clear that i'm not adamantly opposed to lab workflows. if they work for you, that's great, and you should continue to use them. my concern is that lab has been oversold, and that naive users attribute to it an objective correctness that it does not deserve...and ending with rodney's statement: it's [lab] been way over sold, especially if you're working with raw files in a good raw processor. using those tools should (and i would love to see the lab proponents prove otherwise) diminish the need for lab to about nill. its a non intuitive space to work in numerically. there's data loss and time lost going from space to space. it brings little if anything to the party that a good rgb working space can accomplish after proper use of rgb data in good raw processor. way back, in 1998, bruce picked up on a post i had made in the compuserve photo forum about problems that i had trying to print b&w without color casts on the huge and hugely expensive fujifilm pictrography 4000 laser printer. when asked fujifilm whether they could make a b&w profile for this printer they simply said that this was a color printer. bruce was interested in the issues with making such a profile and offered to try to do it: quite an offer to do it for free, for his business was consulting on issues of this type. over six months we exchanged emails and phone calls, and i sent prints to bruce by courier. in the process, bruce found some issues with colorsync, on which he then corresponded with adobe; as well as issues with some of the software that we used, although i don't recall what it was, and had me speak to the developers. the upshot was that the color cast issues could not be solved with a profile: whatever bruce did turned out to be image specific, working on one image but still producing color casts on other images. the solution had to be for fujifilm to build in a b&w capacity into the printer firmware. incidentally, i had hung a few prints from this printer on a wall in bangkok, and two moths later they had turned green in the tropical heat and humidity \u2014 i didn't need to ask about a wilhelm archival rating! luckily, i managed to sell the printer, to someone who needed it for printing proofs and was not concerned with archival quality, for a couple of hundred dollars less than i bought it for. bruce fraser was an extremely nice person and, sadly, died of lung cancer at a relatively young age. ________________________frog leaping photobook edited may 9 by nowhereman", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 109265, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Adam Bonn", "date": "2021-05-19 19:44:00", "content": "It's not really Leica's job to pander to the RAW companies... Leica's base profile (eg \"embedded\" in LR/ACR) follow's adobe's DNG spec, but only so far as to provide two color matrices. These color matrices exist only to map XYZ to the camera using values for StdA (\"D2800\" sic) and D65. (Note that's xyz2camera not camera too XYZ) The full adobe spec for DNG utilises the aforementioned color matrices, forward matrices, two Hue Sat Value (HSD) mapping tables (one for each illuminant) and a LUT which can add many things (hue twists, tone curves, editing robustness etc) Oh and here's the rub - the color matrices adobe uses and the ones Leica use are not the same. So if for example, your M records RAW data with the WB multipliers 0.3456, 1, 0.4867 (I made that up) then the different color matrices used by Leica / Adobe will produce different WB values! Capture One meanwhile uses ICC profiles. I don't really understand DNG (at all in fact) and I know even less about ICC. ICC typically uses the D50 colour space. When you use an X-Rite CC you create a new set of color matrices for your specific camera. When you use adobe's DNG Profile creator you create a new set of HSD tables. In the Adobe DNG spec, the colour you get in LR/ACR is basically a product of the forward matrices and the HSDs. None of the profile creation tools (bar perhaps dcamprof) creates forward matrices for you. It sounds to me... that what you'd need to do is profile your color checker with one camera, then port that calibration over to the other camera. (instructions in the support documentation for DNG profile editor) I have no experience of adobe premier (adobe user here but pre-CC), but I believe that this app has a facility to match to cameras colours via generating a new LUT, which is also perhaps what you want. It's generally considered impossible to match two different cameras exactly. As well as WB, DNG profiles etc you have other hardware constraints such as CFA, filter stack, cover glass, and even power management/stability. The classic example here is the M240 and M262 = identical embedded profile data, very similar sensor and hardware - yet different colours.

I have the M9 and M10 monochroms, but I think that my experience applies. Since the RAW files are absolutely flat they do require some work (unless like kegon above you prefer that look). All black and white films have a characteristic curve and the beauty of the monochrom is that you can create any curve you want. I suspect that the Q2M is similar to the M10M in that those files have a ton of information in them. I found that I needed to move the sliders or adjust the curve more to achieve the same effect I got with my M9M. So be prepared to do some heavy lifting. I was disappointed in the M10M at first because I couldn't get the files to look like I wanted them to look, until I realized that it was just going to take a little more work. Assuming the exposure is good, I first set white and black points in Lightroom. That gives me the entire curve to work with. At that point I generally play with the other tools in LR, but it that doesn't produce a satisfactory result, I go back to the step after setting white and black points and send the file to Silver Effex. Once in SEFx, I may run it through a few favorite presets to see how different adjustments affect the image, or I might start from scratch with the tools on the right. Even if I use a preset, I generally make fine adjustments, then decide if I want to do anything extra, like add sepia or a border. I've found the border burn tool in SEFx to give me better results quickly than hand burning in LR or Photoshop. However, I generally don't find the Control Point tool very useful because it is too nonspecific. If I'm doing a project I generally will make a preset in either LR or SEFx, or both, for a baseline consistency in the images, and then make adjustments. By the way, if I'm just playing around, I develop this in SEFx as an 8 bit JPEG. If I'm trying to make something to display then I will make a 16 bit TIFF. Once back in LR I make my final adjustments. The whole process takes me maybe 10-15 minutes. Longer, depending on the \"significance\" of the image. I have spent hours on specific images, generally over time. I think it's important to live with a print for a while, just like with darkroom prints. It is easy to over-process, as you mention. Then you get that HDR look that some people like. Ashley Gilbertson is a well-known photojournalist for the NY Times who often goes for the HDR look. That might be more than you were asking, but some forum members ask about processing from time to time. This is just what works for me. The short answer to your question is yes, the newer sensors (Q2M, M10M) provide so much information that my methods have changed in that more work is involved.

I used to shoot Hasselblad 6x6 B&W (typically Delta 400). Almost all my shots were with an 80mm lens, and most were wide-open or near wide-open at f2.8. Just preference. I (finally) switched to digital because I just don\u2019t have the time/interest in developing/scanning film, and I wanted something quicker so I could get shots of my toddler. Long story short, I tried lots of digital options and only the Hasselblad with CFV 16 back and Monochrom were still fun to use, but the CFV back obviously didn't help with the speed (was actually slower than film!), and had rather poor low light performance. Also, it was hit-or-miss with B&W conversions, (though great for color close-ups!). What I am trying to do is frankly, mimic my Hasselblad B&W images as best as possible, since it\u2019s the style I\u2019d like to continue shooting. And I'd like to do it using a camera that's a joy to use, and I really enjoy my Monochrom (M10). I crop my Leica shots to 1:1. Perhaps that\u2019s probably blasphemy, but it\u2019s what I like and I make it work well with my Leica. To that end, a 35mm lens on 35mm full-frame sensor (cropped post-production to 1:1) best approximates the same angle of view of an 80mm lens on 6x6 film. I tried the Summicron and just wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of how it rendered. Now I use a Zeiss 35mm f1.4, since I grew rather fond of Zeiss with my Hasselblad. I have not tried any other lenses. Problem is sometimes the images are just too sharp, combined with the M10 Monochrom. Previously grain helped mask some of the distractions in the out of focus but-not-yet-bokeh background, especially twigs/leaves. Now I\u2019m often seeing double lines with that somewhat-out-of-focus subject matter and I find it distracting. It's hard to make out when not zooming in/printing large, and I don't feel like a pixel peeper at all, but there's just general feeling of \"business\" to my eye at least. I do a lot of nature photography and a lot of low DOF, and backgrounds with grasses/pine needles seem to really exaggerate the problem. Adding grain in LR helps, but it\u2019s not quite the same as my film shots, which generally exaggerate the grain in the out-of-focus areas and appears smoother in the in-focus area. In LR, it seems to apply the grain more evenly to both in and out-of-focus areas. You can see an example of an old Hasselblad photo that represents the classic style I usually shot. They have the black border. And the photos in following posts without the border are from the Monochrom M10. I'm guessing it's just a function of too sharp a lens/high resolving sensor as the effect is actually diminished in the photo of my son/father (noticed the most in the pine needles to the left) compared to normal, as that file is lowered significantly in resolution. If that's the only solution then that's the only solution... The picture in the third post is a larger one and the distractions I'm referring to are best seen at the base of the pine tree on the right, though it still doesn't come across great through these web photos. Hopefully others are familiar with the issue I'm describing. I\u2019m hoping for any other ideas on things that might help me reproduce this with my Monochrom. I get that film and digital and 35mm vs medium format are going to be different--just trying to bridge the difference as much as possible. If anyone has other post-production Lighroom/Photoshop techniques they can recommend, I\u2019m all ears. I\u2019m not sure if a different 35mm lens would make much difference (perhaps something softer?), but I\u2019m open to considering that. You see the photos I'm trying to emulate--I felt they're plenty sharp for my eyes.

They were vintage negatives and yet were totally spotless with no evidence at all that they had been touched. I do this for a living, so know how difficult that would achieve. The prints were selling for 30-40000 dollars each, so it was clearly worth it to pay someone to work on each photo for hours or days to bring them to that level. As far as I know Eggleston prints are made as dye transfers. Also a total different beast. You need color matrixes in size of the print for this. Guess that there are also retouching possibilities during this process, but I don't know. Since it was available long before anything digital I would guess it must have been done the classical way, by removing any dust before, or maybe spotting things out with a brush. In the analogue past I sometimes made prints on photographic paper from slides for customers. Don't really liked it and preferred printing from negs for my own stuff. Once for the tonality, but also because you have to remove any dust before, when printing from slides. No fun, but possible with patient. From negs it was much easier, because you could spot out the dust also afterwards. Now with scanning I try to find a good balance by removing as much dust as possible in a few seconds before scanning and do the rest later on the computer. With a brush of camel hair and a compressor I would estimate I get rid of 80 to 90% of the dust before. But mostly there is something left. Another nasty thing is dirt in the washing water. Here you can do nearly nothing about it afterwards. Color film is affected much more then B & W. Here we have quite a lot dirt in the water. After installing a 5 microns filter for the washing water things get much better, but even now not 100% perfect.

Saturday 15th October 2022 Noon. Somewhere in Athens... Given the tough time that we have all had these last couple of years, and the loss of a number of members, including Steve Unsworth who used to join The Challenges on occasion, I would like to propose that we make this Challenge a charity event. The donation would be on behalf of everyone we have lost from the Forum membership. Often, the winner of the Challenge donates the prize money to a charity in any event, but I would like to formally propose that we choose a suitable charity beforehand, as part of the rules. The usual \u20ac10 in the pot would apply, but the donations would be going to a known cause as part of the rules. I have discussed this with Ravi, who braved Athens this year to recce the restaurants on our behalf, and he has suggested a \"Water Aid\" type charity. All charities have found it hard to raise funds since March last year, and an international aid charity along those lines sounds like a grand idea to me.

I agree with you that the optical viewfinder is much more precise and ways quicker on very wide angle lenses. Just to illustrate the problem with wider optics, I did my own quick (torture) test. I typically avoid focus peaking in favor of magnification, but for this test I turned it on. Under similar conditions to your test, low light. The target edge was roughly 2 meters, aperture was F8. First the scene... --img--  Next focus peaking (magnified) with the focus ring set to minimum distance: --img--  Now with focus set to infinity. --img--  If I could have made a video, you'd see that when sweeping though focus from close to infinity the edge was always considered by the software to be in focus regardless. Take a shot at the far end, and of course, the target is quite soft when examined. When one wants the subject in sharp focus relying on focus peaking with a lens such as the WATE where the CoC is deep enough to thwart the tech is not what you want to be doing. Perhaps the accuracy can be improved in future, but at present AFAIC it isn't useful at least to 21mm (from my previous experience with the SEM).

Since you do seem to be serious about this matter, and you seem an intelligent thoughtful guy, I'm sure you see the problem with this contradiction: it's the assumption that one of the criteria for buying a Leica is its looks. It looks far more likely that most Leica users don't buy Leica for its looks because many/most of them don't remove the sticker; they buy them for some other reason - perhaps because they enjoy using it, it takes good pictures, or it works well for a particular type of use. As a sample of one, I can say that I do not buy a Leica for its looks, but for what it does. I don't think a camera is a beautiful object - most are lumpy bits of metal, plastic and glass that don't fit in my pocket like a phone. They are well designed tools for their function though.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/325684-my-take-on-the-one-thing-leica-users-get-wrong/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4301219", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "325684-my-take-on-the-one-thing-leica-users-get-wrong", "result": false, "Selector": "i made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "i find that fascinating and that's why i made a -----> video !!!  on it.", "sortedWord": "video", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 2636, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Jeff S", "date": "2021-05-11 19:46:00", "content": "I don\u2019t assess film vs digital mathematically, but if I tried, I\u2019d make it more apples to apples, and even that would be difficult.

As such, I purchased the following basic accessories with my body: LCD Screen protector 2 x spare batteries 2 x 256GB Sandisk Extreme PRO SD cards 52mm B+W UV filter for frontal lens protection I purchased a Voigtlander 50mm Nokton f1.2 lens as I shoot a lot of street photography at night and wanted a faster lens. This requires ISO settings of around 3200, 1/125 shutter speed to give some stability handheld, and opening up my aperture. Focusing with a limited depth of field at night by rangefinder is tough and the weight of the lens meant the ergonomics for me personally weren't ideal, so I then purchased: Visoflex 020 viewfinder for focus peaking Leica protective half case in black leather for some protection when setting down my camera and for a bit of added grip. After a week of regular shooting, I looked into a thumb grip as I have enjoyed having these on my Fujis and feel it would be a practical addition to my M10. I looked at the Leica and Thumbs Up options but ultimately decided on the Thumbie after reading reviews and because I wanted to preserve the hotshoe for occasions where I need my Visoflex. Two additional purchases I made last night are admittedly unnecessary but personal preferences: Rock n Roll Limited Red Dot Strap as the included leather strap while ok, is only suitable for around the neck when I prefer to wear my camera across body and I thought a thicker, softer leather would be nice given the weight over hours of wear. I also think it looks beautiful and with it being on sale, and with the money I saved by choosing the Thumbie, it still came to be cheaper than purchasing the Leica thumb grip alone. Convex soft release button as it is simply a preference of mine. I bought a Leica one because I am not embarrassed of shooting my M10. I have worked hard for this camera and dreamed of owning a Leica for over a decade. If people want to call me a poser, I can live with it. It may seem like I have GAS and while that is partially correct, I am looking forward to not having to spend more money.

In fact, I have never needed to adjust mine, even after having manged to drop the camera twice (which is not usual for me). For example, my M9 rangefinder needed adjustment every now and then. So your description of the problem sounds a bit strange to me, particularly the problem reappearing after a short time. @jaapv pointed out a few possible reasons, but I would even suspect that there is something loose inside the rangefinder mechanism, even if I have never heard about that this could happen. That is what I thought. But after asking around locally there have been various cases of people having to send their M10s and M10-Ps in for adjustment already, even without dropping them. Maybe it's the heat and humidity? \ud83d\ude06 I think there's definitely something loose inside the camera. I adjusted the horizontal focus myself just to see what's up, and the next day it was off again. I've since sent it in to a local 3rd party Leica repair shop for a full CLA (There's also dust in the viewfinder, amongst other things). Will see when it comes back next month whether the issue has been solved. On 2/15/2021 at 3:35 AM, Tobers said: This is why I quit the M world. This finicky rangefinder adjustment situation killed the user experience for me, even though I loved my M9, M240 and M10 bodies. There seemed no point getting the Lux lenses when you couldn\u2019t focus them properly wide open. I did end up doing some rangefinder adjustment myself (it\u2019s actually not very hard). But for those expecting pixel-peeper levels of sharpness consistently at f/1.4 you may be disappointed. This is my first M. I love it but I can now see why some have 2nd bodies. I'll make do with the Q2 for now whilst waiting for the repairs. 7 hours ago, Maarten said: The stability of the M10 body and the focusing mechanism have proven itself. There are few records that the M10 goes out of alignment spontaneously. What I do not like is that your camera was serviced but the vertical misalignment was not corrected. A proper Leica service will not oversee something like that. I suspect the problem is bit deeper and needs to be investigated. Otherwise you are never going to be happy with your camera. Apparently Leica Thailand do not have the necessary equipment to do anything about focusing issues. They have to send everything to Singapore. \ud83d\ude05 Costs $600 just for P&P and reimport tax as I bought the camera in HK and this is not covered by the warranty. 4 hours ago, jaapv said: Germany is only one UPS day away...

But with the new Kodak price increase, it's fair to ask again. Is it still worth it to shoot film in 2022? Will it ever be as satisfying ? Great question Steven, I've been trying to frame it myself several times for these forum pages but failed where I believe here you've succeeded in cracking the door open. From my perspective, others will of course vary, there's a couple of points to make as far as answering your question..........First you shot a lot of film last week for sure, 27 rolls of 35mm in a week? That's something like what I could have shot as a professional on a session for a magazine or advertising work back in the day, not a problem when you're getting paid for it and the job is \"costs plus\", in other words the clients pick up the tab for film and process out of which maybe a dozen selects will make the first final cut. BUT for an \"amateur\" to shoot that much is as you say quite a chunk of money to blow through. Some can afford that, but it's my guess that most cannot, or would not, if they aren't getting paid for it. Shooting less, shooting more deliberately would vastly cut down the costs and it might, might, help to refine one's deliberation skills in crafting an image. No promises. Looking at the few examples you posted here the one that pulls my eye for colour is the Kodak Vision stock, there's nothing like it. Same goes for digital cinema work come to that, they try and try, Arri comes close, but somehow Vision always tops digital for me. I've stepped back shooting digital quite a bit this past year, and on reflection this was probably after taking a workshop late Spring in Arles that I found utterly illuminating in regards to the way I want now to pursue my personal work, to pursue it hopefully with more deliberation. So for me now I am finding that I am using a film camera more so than I was a year ago, not necessarily because of a certain \"look\" that you get with various film stocks, more so that I now make images in a much more careful way. Look, wait, come back later maybe, then take the frame or two. I am taking out my film M's most days, shoot maybe 4-8 frames on each outing, I've also dusted off my Pentax 6x7 and I'm back truly appreciating that camera again as too with the Nikon F3 that has it's own joy of re-use. Film focuses, ( for want of a better word ), me more on what I want to photograph, and how and why. Digital is wonderful for sure, but it's too damn easy. Processing one's own film is also very satisfying, after the workshop in Arles I resolved to build a darkroom at my home here in the SW and by summer it was in operation, ( this was the first home in many decades that didn't have a darkroom in, it feels \"right\" now it has ), and I like a few others here wouldn't bother to take photographs at all if I wasn't able to round the whole process off by making prints of the few selects that have worked for me. With film it's the \"whole process\" of the craft, with digital not so much so. A personal view of course but from someone who has been at this game since Art School back many decades now, but however you play it it is still magic!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/326838-is-shooting-film-still-worth-it-in-2022/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4318349", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "326838-is-shooting-film-still-worth-it-in-2022", "result": false, "Selector": "i now make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "so for me now i am finding that i am using a -----> film !!!  camera more so than i was a year ago, not necessarily because of a certain \"look\" that you get with various -----> film !!!  stocks, more so that i now make images in a much more careful way.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 48353, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Kriehuber", "date": "2021-11-28 18:53:00", "content": "2 hours ago, Steven said: I\u2019m just wondering how I\u2019d convinced immigration in Cuba not to scan my 50 rolls of portra !

How I travel with my Film: I remove ALL Films no matter 35mm or 120 ( its different for large format) from their packaging. This includes ALL Paper Boxes, Plastic Wraps and Plastic Containers, just the Films nothing else. NO Packaging in any way. Then I put all of them in a completely clear, high quality ziplock bag.

( I always reuse the Ziplock bags ) Then I put all of the Ziplock bags with the Film inside in a separate bigger, completely clear bag so they are all at one place. I put this bag in my carry on bag. BEFORE I go to get my carry on stuff checked, I take the clear bag with all the Ziplock bags with the film inside out of my carry on bag and just hold it in my Hands while waiting. Then I go to get my carry on stuff checked. I tell the people doing the check \"This is all my carry on stuff, it would be amazing if you could hand check this small part of it because it will get damaged and will be unusable afterwards, all the rest can get xrayed no problem. I also say them \" I know its a bit annoying, but thats why I separated it from all other stuff and put it in a clear bag so you can check it really fast and easy. If it wouldn't be unavoidable to get it hand checked I wouldn't have asked. \" As said before its important to be as friendly as possible and as early as possible. Never get unfriendly. Normally that works just fine, they happily hand check my film and they are finished with it before my other stuff did go through the xray / I got checked. When this does not work ( maybe happened four or five times ) I stay as friendly as possible, I explain them that its not possible to get the Film through the x-ray machine and that I made sure the make it as easy as possible for them. If there is no other why I tell them that I know that they have to hand check my stuff when I want them to while also saying that if it wouldn't needed I wouldn't have asked. I traveled with thousands of rolls films like this, through so many different Airports and it always worked for me. Its important to always be as friendly as possible, to be early and to always insist on your right to get your stuff hand checked while staying extremely friendly. Also don't have a camera on you while doing all this. Rewind the Film before hand. Put the Films inside the Clear bag in a Ziplock for exposed Films and Put the Camera(s) in your carry on bag. As said this always worked for me and I never had a bad experience with anyone like this. Most of the people working at the Airports are extremely friendly as long as you are also friendly. I know I repeated myself quit a lot saying you need to be friendly but that is SO important. But I assume you are a friendly guy no matter what, so I have no worries there!

My lenses are old Leica lenses from the 1960's, and much newer Voigtlander lenses. Then too, I'll use me as an example, how much resolution do I need? I'm usually posting my photos electronically, and how much resolution can the people seeing my images on their IBM, Apple, and other computers, actually see? If I were making huge enlargements, maybe I'd be using something other than 24 x 36mm image size (film or digital). Maybe instead of shooting with a Leica M-A, I should switch to a larger format film? I probably need to drop out of this discussion. I'm not wanting to shoot film because it is better or worse than digital, and the fact that it's now 2021 is irrelevant. I grew up shooting film, and enjoyed it immensely. With a lot of effort, I could get what I thought were beautiful 8x10 and 11x14 prints out of my enlarger. The \"feeling\" of shooting film is just so overwhelmingly different than shooting digital - maybe because I only take one image, and I better get it right. With digital, I would take an image, review it in the camera, and often change something to improve the image. With film that was never an option. So I put more of \"me\" into every photo I take, and when I get the negatives back, I remember each individual photo. Not so with digital. Either despite what most of you have to say, or because of what you have to say, it mostly reinforces my desire to shoot film, even if it killed any desire I had to buy a new M-A. Even for the M cameras - Leica keeps coming out with newer and better, but what is newer and better - the electronics, not the \"camera\". Sorry for blabbering on and on, but it's very difficult to express my thoughts in words. Meanwhile, I now have both my M3 and M2 ready to go, the new film I ordered (all B&W) arrived, and my new \"OpticFilm 8200i Ai\" should arrive tomorrow. I'll get my negatives back this coming Monday. I'll post some of them here, and probably get some feedback as to how well I'm (not?) doing.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323361-is-it-worth-buying-analogue-in-2021/page/7/?tab=comments#comment-4263745", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "323361-is-it-worth-buying-analogue-in-2021", "result": false, "Selector": "i were making", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "if i were making huge enlargements, maybe i'd be using something other than 24 x 36mm image size (-----> film !!!  or digital).", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 882, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Steven", "date": "2021-05-28 23:28:00", "content": "1 hour ago, a.noctilux said: Second is film without hesitation \ud83d\ude09.

Is there a \u2018soul\u2019 rating scale that is not image-specific? So many more questions...

I made reference to the lens / film register because whenever I became involved in discussions about the Canon I frequently got told that the Japanese register was different and could not be used with Leica lenses also that Japanese engineering was simply inferior. This reached such a point, remember this is 50+ years ago, that I took the VI-T to Wallace Heaton in Bond Street who were then the preeminent Leica dealer in London to be checked. They had a Leica approved workshop with the finest measuring equipment and it is no exaggeration to say that they were astonished by the Canon's quality.

I use it all the time with wide lenses where it is difficult to discern focus transitions due to the great inherent DoF. It is less necessary with normal and longer focal length lenses since the transitions become easier to see clearly; as focal length grows even longer, it can actually decrease the ability to see focus transitions due to camera movement while working the focus ring interacting poorly with the EVF refresh rate. The problem become accentuated in low light conditions when the camera needs to collect several frames worth of light before it can refresh the EVF, leading to EVF jitter. How fast or how slow to work I find is a matter of intent and self discipline. I know I get much better photographs when I stop just looking and pressing the shutter release: I have to look, think (observe and recognize what my intent with a particular scene or subject might be), make adjustments to the camera to optimize that intent, and then press the shutter release. Whether I'm using an AF system or zone focusing, using peaking or magnification\u2014or not, or whatever, doesn't really matter. The critical point of slowing down is the thinking part which has to come from within, and is not imposed by whatever the equipment requires me to do. As example, I had my lovely old 1952 Voigtl\u00e4nder Perkeo II out for a walk the other day. The workflow on this camera is wind on the film, scale focus only so set a distance, set an aperture to cover the required DoF, set the matching shutter time (before cocking the shutter because of the old Synchro-Compur shutter), cock the shutter, frame and release the shutter. I found I made 12 good exposures, and quickly (the entire roll), but for one thing: in every case, I was not thinking about how level the camera was and, as a result, every frame but one is slightly rotated to the left (a quirk of my eye always causes this effect if I'm not thinking enough to correct it...).

I cannot recall having ever seen the term in common use before 2001. However, the \"miniature format\" wars from the 1930-ies to the 1950-ies between the adherents of 6x9 and 36x24 are well known. A NEW CAMERA CONTROL - DOF control: It might be time for Leica and others to add a control that would allow easy switching and indication of the sensor size format before taking the picture. I am not familiar enough with all the digital bodies to know if this exists. Smaller formats give more Depth Of Field so you could pick them for some situations. Larger formats give shallower DOF. A DOF control. This sensor size DOF adjustment phenomena could be, in modern times, with high resolution lenses and sensors that deliver sharp pictures regardless of sensor size, a bonafide menu or dial/switch option. Just turn the dial for more DOF or less, by changing the amount of the sensor used more or less (of course indicate this on the electronic viewing monitor). Some users would want the viewing screen to just show frame lines for the smaller sensor and others would want to fill the viewing screen with the cropped or full frame sensor. The body would best have a medium format size sensor and then allow selection of DOF by varying the sensor size with a body switch. Of course this is happening in video already with only using part of the digital sensor on still cameras, but I am saying make it an official feature with its own vertical or horizontal switch that looked different than a dial. Would this work or do I not understand the optics? Or can you just crop and get this effect anyway? I want an external switch selector for DOF!

It's what we want t know ! The full story is I went from a pair of Nikons D2x and D3 and another basket of lenses to the first Fuji X-Pro1 with a 35mm lens. That was superb and I loved it. Photo, build and lens quality. I also bought an X100. I enjoyed having the Fuji stuff. Over time I moved through the X-Pro and X100 range ending up with the kit above. They gave great results and the lenses were mostly superb (especially the 56mm f1.2). By the time I sold the Nikons, I had done enough safaris and sports photography (carrying a Nikon 300mm f2.8 around for weeks on end was not fun) with my photography moving to landscape and events. I only used aperture priority but was constantly fiddling with or worrying about all the other settings to \"suit\". The Fujis were nicely built but not \"wow\" and had become computers first and cameras second in my mind. I don't do video (shudder) and just wanted to get back to enjoying photography, which is where the X100f fitted but that was not weather sealed. I had a Leica M6 some time ago so knew how beautiful it was as a piece of engineering but also how happy I was with nothing more than a single (35mm) lens. When I saw a You-tube video on the simplicity of the Q2 a couple of months ago I made the switch (I also looked at the M10R but manual focus is not ideal for me nowadays). Fuji is good but not a patch on the Leica build quality. Fuji colours are wonderful, but so are the Q2 colours. The Q2 lens is sharper than the Fujis, mostly, but most important to me and to answer to your question: the Q2 has made me love holding a camera and taking photos again. I am not constantly fiddling and worrying about setting something that was probably fine where it was already set. The Q2 just feels good in my hands.

I used it daily and took it with me to the jungles of Belize in April along with my R8. Later that year in Madagascar a beautiful primatologist (specializing in lemurs) tried to convince me to trade it for her D1 plus cash. Circa 2008 the sensor began to fail and Leica replaced the sensor for free. In early 2009 in Uganda or Rwanda the door to the battery and memory card would not stay closed, preventing me from actuating the shutter. I made a temporary repair by keeping it closed with a Band-Aid (plaster) from our small first aid kit, but when we got back home I took it to Leica USA. It was not repairable, but they did sell me a refurbished one at a very attractive price. Early in the morning in the fall of 2012 while walking through Greenwich Village I marveled at there being so many early 1960s cars parked about for several blocks, all looking used, so they were not there for an auto show. As it turned out I had wandered onto the location set of Inside Llewyn Davis, a Coen Brothers film. A production assistant stopped me just west of Washington Square Park so they could finish a take, and remarked to me about how much he admired Leica cameras, and thought my D2 was an early M. He was surprised to see images on the screen. My D2 and I eventually parted ways to both help fund a newer Leica purchase, and, as I rationalized, I had become used to \"faster\" cameras with better EVFs. I think if I didn't need the cash to upgrade I'd still have it today, with the frightening caveat that the sensor might fail at any time, and no replacement parts have been available for years.

I made a photo today that was taken with a 47 year old camera and lens, using a film that was discontinued by Kodak ten years ago. By luck, or maybe just by design, it came out well, so I decided to print it. And then my troubles started... I have three inkjet printers. The oldest is an HP 7600 that was lauded in its day, but has been relegated to reserve duty since I acquired an Epson 2400 (the recipient of a failed experiment with refillable cartridges and the QUADtone RIP) and then it's replacement, an Epson P-600. I also have an HP B210 MFC which is capable or printing directly from an iPhone or iPad, and doesn't decline to perform if printing from the computer. This photo was good enough I decided to do an experiment, and print it from all three. They all have the latest drivers for the computers they are connected to, and all have full ink cartridges. The Epson P-600 (newest of all) apparently uses the manufacturer's trick of adding cyan to black-only monochrome prints. Plainly the result is is a blue to white mono spectrum and of no use to me. This trick is a way of using colour cartridges even when they are not needed and the printer will not function if any cartridges \"need\" replacing (even if it is an MFC that is just scanning). It also produced vertical lines across the prints from top to bottom of light and dark lines. The HP B210 did something similar, with so much cyan added it was a purple-white monochrome spread. My oldest printer, the HP 7600, made a B&W photo with no coloured ink as far as I could tell, but it was very dark, with the dark parts of the subject's hair being uniform black, and with a nasty 'jpg-compression-like' line of sudden change from dark to absolute black (absolute as far as that printer is concerned) down her neck. Looked like a poor quality jpeg with visible gradations. Since it seemed to be the only printer that made a true B&W only print, I played with its driver and tried what I could to avoid those artifacts. The driver has options for \"Real Life Digital Photography\" and I hope you feel as scared as I do by that name alone. Among those options are \"Adaptive Lighting\" and \"Photo Brightening\". Low, medium or high in each case. High means a print with none of the sudden JPG-like changes between light and dark areas, but no artifacts and yet it is far too light overall. Medium results in one with all the artifacts, as does low.. Yes, I wasted paper and ink testing them separately. It seems the only printer I have that works as expected (but does not do photos) is may Brother MFC laser printer. In order to try to print an acceptable version of one photo I have wasted a dozen sheets of premium lustre photo paper, and now two of these printers are claiming they need new ink cartridges, which will cost around $50/cartridge when shipped. It would be cheaper to spend a day or two in the darkroom (which I no longer have) running multiple sheets of Ilford MG through the enlarger than to do this! I'm about to move house I will certainly keep and take the Brother MFC. If I could take one inkjet that prints decently from macOS 12 for B&W prints, what ought it to be in your experience? Or is it the case now that a photo on the wall must be professionally made elsewhere and not at home? Mods: please move this thread wherever makes sense to you!

The overheating problem (which only occurred in very hot weather using the Visoflex) was solved in the first firmware update and the 240 series sensors never suffered from corrosion, that was the first generation of M9 sensors.

My main goal was to see how I could use my tripod instead of buying a copy stand and to test my new Canon 100mm lens. To that end, the test was hugely successful. My tripod was adequate to the task and really left nothing to be desired. I didn\u2019t even need to reverse the center pole as the head pivoted exactly enough to enable the camera to point downward. The lens focused as expected as well. I do need to spend more time on the camera settings and leveling but as a proof of concept it worked well and set up was very quick. The main issue I encountered was Lightroom. I reversed the points in the Lightroom curve and got a positive image, but even this really wasn\u2019t enough. I think I need to buy Negative Lab Pro. Otherwise, tho, the system worked as intended. I find that LR is good for B&W, with a bit of work with the tone curve (after inverting, bend it steeply convex to top right). If you're working in colour, then before buying Negative Lab Pro you might want to look at this page. I thought the same as you and bought Negative Lab Pro but found some work was still needed to get colours right. Using Alex Burke's method I could get close to the same standard, but the advantages are (a) I could have saved some money and (b) once I tweaked the settings to suit one image I could make a preset and use it for the rest of the sequence/film/batch. I now have basic Lightroom presets for Ektar and Portra (as well as one for B&W negatives) which speed up the whole process. FWIW I'm scanning 4x5 negatives, not 35mm film, with a SL2-S on a tripod and a Kaiser Slimlight Piano. Incidentally, after scanning, inverting and getting the colours right in Lightroom, I usually set noise reduction, sharpening and clarity sliders to zero, and run the image through Topaz Sharpen AI, which yields a tiff (of course you could avoid Topaz and just export it from LR as a tiff). All the exposure etc sliders are now pointing the right way and you can do other adjustments without having to persuade your brain it's in an inverse universe.

It is pure marketing and increasing profits for the manufacturers - because they can. I am working in an industry which does exactly the same to customers - increasing prices every so often to increase margins and profitability by making exactly the same. Many reasons are mentioned for price increases which are most of the time just excuses. Since all others are doing the same - without collusion - the customers are forced to pay the price. There are reasons to increase prices like raw material increases, inflation for example, but I find these not proportional to the adjusted price increases of products. Manufacturers in general are just waiting for reasons to crank up prices for consumers - look at all the supply issue excuses which drive up prices nearly everywhere from groceries to cars (where the latter with chips is a real issue). Same here with film - there are valid reasons when looking 16 years back in time (which is funny itself) why film prices like everything else went up. But c'on, it does not explain why film manufacturers crank up film prices from $6 per roll to $10-12!

In future I shall put sticky labels on them so I can write the shot details, which will make it easy to find again slides which I realise afterwards I have taken wrongly.

I beg to differ here since I am shooting still with several Leica film cameras in parallel to digital - I am glad that my M-E 240 can do video, LiveView etc. I rather have more options but can decide not to use them instead of having less upfront. But good thing is that Leica recognizes different preferences and makes cameras according to this. I personally like to be minimalistic when shooting film but want to have more in-camera options when it comes to digital. Or in other words: my style shooting film and digital differ from each other.

If you do not want to update the computer (understandable), try buying 32gb or more from OWC. They have ready to go kits with instructions, and it is really not bad to upgrade it. Making sure you have free space (at least 25% of the drive is probably best) is also important. If you do not have enough free space, the entire computer can slow. I had a really bad printing issue where prints just would not send to the printer. I eventually figured it out that there was not enough space left on the drive to render the print and send it to the printer. I often make big prints from film scans, and the prints are really large as they are sent to the printer, so you need a bunch of space to account for it. All that said, the M1 revolution is apparently just that. It has been a very long time since a generation of Apple computers has been so much faster than the last gen. Even a Mac Mini M1 can outperform some of the fastest Macs of the Intel generation, especially for CPU heavy tasks.

It is not backwards compatibility...it is forward compatibility. This can certainly be an issue in history as well (lack of ability to translate things in dead languages etc), but I think for the most part until the computer age, we retained the ability to maintain, fix and use older technology, even if it became obsolete. Cameras are a good example. We are still using Leica IIIs. When they become difficult to repair, it is not because we cannot make the parts, it is because it is not economical to do so. With digital informational technology, the challenges are different. We can effortlessly replicate data and transfer it to new storage all the time. But it seems that the other side to that is that data is generally tied to the most current platforms if users want to make use of it in the contemporary world, but the makers of those platforms have no incentive preserve the older information. It is like going to a library where every book is under lock and key. In any case, I am just worried about what happens to things further down the line. We are not even 40 years into ubiquitous computing, and while a government, museum or university archive might have a plan on how to manage their data, the general public is totally unprepared.
