Thank you for your comments! Mark, I believe we have a lot in common and I think a lot of us who are not part of the group-think and prevalent gear trends are silenced by the sheer noise of gear mania. And that is unfortunate. There are few who want to be seen as contrary or not part of the crowd, but I have been that way all my life. Personally, I don't care what anyone uses to create their art. Unfortunately, there are many who don't consider their photography as art. However, they march to their own music as well. Just as the film v digital war still rages, gear wars are even worse it seems. My full-time exposure to Medium Fornat is only a few years, but I have found that I much prefer MF whether it be film or digital. My use of the H5D-50c has amazed me and my clients have appreciated the results as well. Gear selection is a personal thing with many ways to look at it. My preferences have nothing to do with smaller size and lighter weight. If I want snapshots, I always used my M or X1. But I appreciate, and prefer the quality and feel of heavier instruments like the M vs. lighter gear and I am delighted with the size, weight, quality, simplicity and results of both the S cameras and the H system. I am sure Phase One would be on my preferential gear list if I could afford even a used one. Everyone is different of course. For me, at the end of the day, did my gear provide me an experience, including gear aesthetics, that was pleasurable and did the results meet my expectations? My film cameras always have. The H system and the S system both fit my preferences like a well-tailored suit and are as comfortable as a favorite pair of jeans to me. And, the results always astonish me.

I wasn\u2019t suggesting current use of a Holga, although that could be a fun and creative adventure! But I was serious concerning your early learnings, including that PP and printing skills can be critical in terms of the end product. I would have thought that with the X1D, for instance, careful color management, custom profiling and a disciplined PP workflow could lead to similarly stellar prints (color and appeal) as with the S, despite any out-of-camera/lens differences. The point was that while the Holga was a \u2018toy\u2019, the X1D (and Fuji) are superb modern tools, most of which by top manufacturers aren\u2019t IQ limited these days. But I guess that comes dangerously close to the often debated question as to whether there is a \u2018Leica look\u2019.

First, using ones creativity and inspiration to capture the moment in time, then processing the negatives and finally the print(s). The professor and teaching assistants were most helpful in instructing how to best get the end state of prints. Even though the camera itself had limitations, the negative and printing technique became ones personal expression of what was seen and created. It was a excellent teaching moment that lasted throughout my life whether it be the darkroom or later Light Room. Admittedly, the X1D and Fuji systems for me as an early user was limited by the availability of lenses, software bugs to a small degree, etc.. I did try various color management techniques and profiling in hopes of finding a solution to my clients criticism of the look and feel of the images. It finally dawned on me, the clients had become accustomed to a \"look\" and \"feel\" they liked. I was thinking that I could with time, get images they would buy for their collections. From my experience, I misjudged my clients tastes and thoughts. I was hesitant to go back to the Leica systems mainly due to the expense. I did like the smaller, lighter X1D, but those factors don't create the image....just keeps my muscles more happy. Ultimately, I moved back to the Leica S and M systems and my clients resumed purchasing for their collections. Last, I couldn't agree with you more about the debate of the Leica look and variables involved. Some say they can see and feel it...others not so much, if at all. If anything, I think my clients felt they liked the consistency of the \"look\" and \"feel\" of what they see in my images. Perhaps had I stayed with the other systems, in time I could have done the same thing. But for me and what the private collectors and clients purchase, I find it easier for me to convey my thoughts, creative vision in a medium they have grown accustomed too and ultimately buy.

I currently use the S007 for my pro landscape work and have many of the S lenses (4+ years). Like you, I tried the Fuji and Hasselblad X1D and associated lenses mainly because I wanted to take the medium format cameras on long-distance and remote hikes. I found my clients did not like the rendering of either the Fuji or Hasselblad systems and they voted with their wallets. It wasn't a color management, etc., that was the issue, it is simply the way the Leica S lenses draw. So, I sold the other systems and I went back to the S007 system and my clients are happy. As far as sensor of the other cameras, that did not play a factor for me. It is always photograph content that is key to separating a mere photo from a photograph that makes a person; Stop, Look, Think and if possible Feel, with feeling being the most difficult IMO to convey. As for the shutter being better, Yes it is better than previous S cameras. But for my work, I always use a tripod and don't handhold the camera. I have written other posts here on the S blog about my experience with the other systems and going back to the S. Personally, I like the user interface of the S and other Leica cameras too; i.e., simple and intuitive. It always gets down to two things anyways...shutter speed and f/stop the rest IMO is gravy. A drawback for me, the S camera weight became an issue for me hiking 20-30 KM a day in mountains at my age to be challenging. What I did to resolve my hiking/camera weight issue was to use the S camera for short distance hikes 0-10 KM and take S lenses that I think will help me create the photographs that I envision. I use the SL system for the long-distance hikes and M system for really challenging remote hikes. For me and my clients, the S system is superb and at least I have alternatives as well with the SL and M to help me get to the places I need to go to capture that moment in time.

I certainly don't read every post on this, or any other, site.. What stupidity has the EU foisted upon us now? I'll go hunt for his post. I'm sure it will irritate me and raise my blood pressure. Whatever the reason, reducing a photo forum to the same level as the photo email list that I created in 1991 is just insipidly ridiculous. Might as well toss the notion of a photo forum completely and go back to text-only emails. And, btw, I live in the USA and have absolutely no voice or influence in the politics of the EU.

Which tone curve have you used at that step? Have you imported a M10 tone curve? Are there any other peculiarities you would emphasize in creating the M10P profile? Thanks, Patrick I just watched the video again to remind myself as it was over a year ago that I created my profiles. I think it's the part at 6 minutes into the video that you refer to. Yes I just used the LeicaM10-Generic curve. Capture One support came back to me the other day with the following response to my further request for M10P support in version 20 with the following: \"Implementation of camera support by the R&D department can indeed take some time. But as I see, multiple requests have already been sent in regards to the camera support in question. Hereby, its release should be expected soon.\" I requested support of the M10P whilst version 11 was current and again when version 12 was released.
