While I don't like the situation, it seems that Leica has come up with a reasonable policy to deal with it. But we must all understand that the cost of a broken M8 LDC just went up considerably.

It is an approximation. We know the resolution of a sensor is not 1:1 with the spacing of the pixels, for a variety of reasons - Bayer pattern color distinctions; AA filters, or the aliasing artifacts one gets without AA filters, etc. We also know that it is often better, depending on subject detail, than the 1:2 relationship known as the Nyquist limit (at least 2 samples for every captured value - i.e. line of lens resolution). Therefore it is some number between 1 and 2, and 1.5 is the shorthand for \"somewhere between 1 and 2\". One might also note that since image details don't necessarily line up with the grid of pixels, in some cases the effective \"resolution\" will be between the centers of pixels with touching corners, which will be root 2 (1.41) times the sides of the pixels. \"So we get: \u2022 Leica M9: 145 pixel/mm corresponds to 96 lp/mm. \u2022 Nikon D800E: 205 pixel/mm corresponds to 137 lp/mm. \u2022 Sony NEX-7: 255 pixel/mm corresponds to 171 lp/mm. ... so long as one does not take into account any AA filtering, or other blurring. Some say there is noticeable loss of per-pixel resolution between the M8 and the M9, simply because the M9 has a thicker cover glass/IR filter (0.7mm vs. the M8's 0.5mm - I don't see it myself). The Nikon D800E uses a \"reversing\" AA filter - one blurring layer that supposedly cancels out the effect of the other blurring layer - which I doubt works perfectly, but no doubt restores some sharpness. The Sony Nex-7 has - who knows what level of AA filtering (fairly little, from the samples I've seen, but probably not zero). It seems to me you are trying to come up with hard, quantitative results based on data that is going to, by necessity (and literally, when it comes to AA filters) always be \"fuzzy.\" Lots of things that Sony or Nikon or Leica know, but are not public domain. You can probably find Modern or Pop. Photography reviews** of some of your earlier lenses that gives the resolution the magazine measured on an optical bench (they used to do that, pre-1980s).

Andy, Thanks for your post. As always very informative. Sorry if I gave you a headache with this thread. We got quite a bit of wet snow over night. It brought down a power line in the neighborhood and we were without power until a few minutes ago, so my computers were cut off the Internet. Maybe I should explain briefly what I hope to get out of this thread. Basically, at a minimum, a rough estimate of Leica lens resolution limits as they developed over time, and hopefully accurate numbers for some lenses. Despite power loss, I was able to read on my iPad some older material of Erwin Puts that I had downloaded before and found some more useful information about Leica lens resolution limits. I plan to summarize that later. If I understand you correctly, then the corresponding line pairs per mm numbers I computed for the three different sensors should be viewed as upper limits due to the effects you describe. And 01af seems to imply to cut back the numbers even further by another factor of 2. Interesting. With regards to the D800E, a Nikon manager stated in an interview, that for cost reasons in order to have the same register distance for the D800 and D800E, they left the first part of the filter in the D800E. This splits the signal in two. So, instead of splitting it again subsequently (in the other direction) as in the D800, they just recombine the split signals, effectively canceling the first split. I doubt Nikon will release the D800E to market unless they convinced themselves of a satisfactorily implementation. Thanks also for the pointers to Modern or Pop. Photography reviews. I will see what my local library has. Many thanks again.

Awhile back, I came up with an idea of what my perfect Leica digital M camera would be. The concept would be to have a digital M camera with a reduced feature set that more closely replicated the experience of classic film Leica photography. The resulting camera might, in theory, be less expensive to produce than a full fledged M9, thereby constituting a \"budget\" model. The important specs would be: 1) NO rear LCD. Think how revolutionary that would be. One of the \"benefits\" of film photography that is often touted by its proponents is that you are free from the potential distraction that a rear LCD brings. No \"chimping\" your shots. No fiddling with menu settings. You remain in the moment, engaged with your subject. Of course, with enough discipline you can do that with an LCD, but by removing it entirely you remove the temptation to go back and look at your results and instead focus on getting the next perfect shot. Another thing you remove is a major production cost, which results in a lower price point for the consumer. Instead of an LCD, there would be a traditional wheel to set ISO. There would be no other buttons on the rear panel. When you think about it, other than focus, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO the only other essential setting that needs to be made is selecting the capture format: RAW, JPEG, etc. Which leads to... 2) Capture in RAW (DNG) format only. To make the camera as simple and pure as possible, and to ensure only the best quality original files, the camera would only capture in a RAW format such as Adobe's DNG \"digital negative\" format. There is then no need to set things such as white balance, compression, megapixel quality, etc.-- the types of things that you might have spent time fiddling with on the LCD screen. All image tweaking would be done in post-processing. 3) Shutter cocking lever. Got this idea from the Epson RD-1 from years ago. By deleting both the rear LCD and motor for cocking the shutter you would conserve a significant amount of battery power. A single battery charge might last weeks, instead of hours or days. It also replicates an important part of the classic Leica M experience lacking in the M8/9. 4) Hybrid optical viewfinder with electronic framelines. I've been led to believe that one of the biggest costs in producing an M camera is the installation and calibration of the frame lines. Replacing these with elctronic framelines, such as used in the Fuji X series, saves money and provides for potentially more accurate and reliable framing. 5) As for focusing, I don't have any great ideas other than keeping the tried and true optical rangefinder. While it is expensive, there is no better way I am aware of to accurately focus a manual M lens. 6) Return of the M8's top panel LCD for battery status and frame count. With no large rear panel LCD, that would become a necessity. 7) The weather-sealed bottom plate would be removed to reveal the battery compartment, SD card slot, and an industry standard USB connection. What are your thoughts? I have no realistic expectation that such a camera would ever be produced either by Leica or any 3rd party, but I've never heard some of these ideas tossed around before.

Excellent area to meet near the Arnolfini David, a good suggestion. its central to see some of 'Old Bristol' or there are plenty of places to sit and chat around Millenium Square or M Shed. It has all the makings of a good meet. I'm looking forward to be able to put faces to names. Well done Best wishes Mike --img--  PS not sure about the Grove Car Park, just checked it out and it say payment is by mobile phone :-( Haven't come across that before !!
