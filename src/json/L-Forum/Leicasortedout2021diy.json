Following up on my M10-P Rangefinder drifting thread, where I asked whether the body was front focusing or not, I went to Leica in Thailand and even though the camera is still within it's warranty, they told me that they cannot solve focusing issues and the camera has to be sent to Singapore. As my camera was bought from HK, I will have to pay P&P of 250USD as well, and it will take around 2-3 months. I also would have to go find the receipt, as they cannot just look at the serial number for some reason. If I am unable to supply the receipt, then a maintenance fee will be charged as well. Yesterday I had some free time and was itching to get the problem sorted, so I researched this forum about DIY rangefinder adjustments and a few YouTube videos, went out and bought a 2mm Hex key for $1 and adjusted the roller for horizontal alignment myself, using the night stars as a guide for infinity. However, my vertical alignment is also off so there are always 2 stars in the focusing patch no matter what I do, making adjustment very difficult. At the end of all that, the rangefinder does not coincide at infinity, but focus from 0.7m - 5m seems to be accurate (still slightly front focusing but acceptable) for Summilux-M 50mm at F1.4. I have a few questions regarding the adjustments. Horizontal adjustment (please kindly see attached photo from the internet, of an M7?) When the hex key is inserted into the hole, and clockwise turns (red arrow) are very easy and the rangefinder arm does not move at all. However, when I try to turn anti-clockwise (green arrow) the rangefinder arm pivots down into the body with the turn, so I had to do a lifting motion whilst also turning the hex key. This lifted the rangefinder arm further out of the body once, but it then moved back so I am not sure whether this will cause any problems in the long term. I made sure not to press the rangefinder arm in the direction of the top plate and it looks the same as far as I can tell. Hopefully I didn't bend it? Vertical adjustment Apparently this can also be done with the 2mm hex key. However, I have no idea how to unscrew the cover screw on the camera without scratching it.

The Summilux 50 asph is known for calibration issues, due to the exceedingly tight tolerances in the floating element mechanism. If the problem is with the lens you can find out by mounting a lens with known correct calibration. OTOH, the adjustment of the rangefinder is basically done at two places, the roller wheel and the internal screw of the arm. The roller wheel is for infinity and can be done in DIY.

Thank you very much for the reply!! cayenne Canon 50/1.4 or 50/1.8 (get the earlier, silver brass, heavier version of the latter, which is not prone to fogging). The Canon 50/1.2 is also an interesting lens, but finding one that doesn't haze on the penultimate rear element may take several iterations (rather easy to DIY clean though). Nikkor 50/1.4 or 50/2. Both are Sonnar designs. Note that some lenses on the used market may seem to be significantly more expensive than others for no apparent reason. This is due to rarity of some of the versions, batches, etc. I'd just start by buying on the basis of condition at a price that makes sense. Fast 35mm LTM lenses from Nikon or Canon tend to be rather expensive. The Canon 35/2 may be your best bet. For fast longer lenses, the Nikkor 85/2 is not too hard to find in good condition at very decent prices. Canon 85mm lenses are a mixed bag in terms of size/weight, IQ and price: I'd pick the 85/1.8, although it's not cheap. For RF use, make sure you get the appropriate LTM to M adapter (ie, the one that matches the focal length of the lens) so that it brings up the correct framelines.

If a lens is coded, you see that right away. Once you know what those codes look like, you also see right away when a lens is not coded. There are many sites in the internet with examples and explanations, such as this one: https://www.devonbuy.com/how-to-6-bit-code-leica-m-lens/ (I am not associated in any way with that site; I just picked one at random) Any digital Leica M camera with reasonably recent software will be able to recognize every M lens which is correctly coded and mounted. The software in the camera contains a table which lists every known code. The camera might mistake uncoded lenses for coded ones when there are scews or other things (dirt, for instance) where the camera expects the dark and light spots of the code. In this case, the camera will claim that one of the coded lenses was mounted when there is, in fact, quite a differernt lens, usually elderly, certainly without any code. The camera also might misread an existing correct code when the 'code reader' (the eyes that should see the code) are not clean enough or broken. When you mount an uncoded lens, the camera will show you a list of all (uncoded) M-Lenses known to Leica, so that you can tell the camera what lens you mounted. From then on, the camera will name that lens in the EXIF data until you mount a coded lens. I think the camera remembers that uncoded lens and will use that information when later you mount an uncoded lens again, but I'm not sure about that. I don't own any digital M cameras any more. The adapter for mounting R lenses to the M camera is mentioned above. This adapter is coded, just like the lenses are, and its code tells the camera (unsurprisingly) that it is an adapter and that it accepts R type lenses. I rather think that in this case you then tell the camera which of the supported R type lenses is mounted, but I don't know that. When your camera mentions the Leica R adapter it can do so for two reasons: One, there is a Leica R adapter mounted. Two, it misread the code and there's is something else mounted. You tell us. Thanks Philipp for the detailed info. None of my Leica lenses are coded, and as you've pointed out I'm sure that because of this I would have immediately have noticed that this lens was coded, had it arrived to me either 'properly' coded, or DIY coded from a previous owner . This is good to know. None of my other lenses are coded (and let's presume this one isn't either), and they all show 'Leica R Adaptor'. So I just interpret this to be 'unknown lens', since I don't have an R adaptor. The same EXIF data reading appeared when I used one of my lenses on my friends M10R, so I don't think this is particular to my camera, it is perhaps common for uncoded lenses. For the lens in question, the camera was certainly recognising it previously as a 35 Summicron. If that was through dirt on the flange then it would seem unlikely (although not impossible) that it 'guessed' it correctly (I know that's not what you were suggesting and that you were talking in general terms about how the coding and reading works). So let's presume that the naming information is not coming from the lens, it must be manually set on the camera. The curious thing is that the M10-D doesn't have this functionality (unlike other digital M's). Or at least if it does it's not common knowledge ... many others on this forum don't think it does / don't know how to do it . Despite this, if it was done at the camera end then it certainly wasn't manually input by myself because I don't know how to do it. So it would've had to be done by a previous owner with the same lens and for it to have been the last one they manually entered, in the way you explained. Seems unlikely especially given the M10-D not having this functionality, but maybe not impossible. Understand that it's not voodoo but with these parameters it's quite hard to determine how/where this lens was getting named into EXIF . I'm curious as to what the technician says regarding whether they cleaned off anything from the flange but I just can't imagine having this lens and not noticing that kind of DIY. And the previous owner also said it's not 6-BIT coded. All things considered, maybe the real mystery is how someone manually coded a lens-type into an M10-D. Or some dirt on the flange was indeed being 'read' as the correct lens by some stroke of luck, and is now clean.

I have the adapter myself but because it is a combo deal, I bought the adapter anyway. The lock pin is slightly lose (this was disclosed by seller) on this new one but fully functional. After one trip out, I found the small lock nut disappeared. Everything else is still there but the out side nut. I regret I didnt spend time investigate when I got the adapter. After this accident happen, I took a close look for the one I have. It should be a easy job to tight it up. (maybe half hour, because I need remove the mount ring to do so) Without thinking, I send to Leica NJ. and the adapter was send to Germany. A few day later, I got the invoice. $1400 plus shipping. I can't believe my eyes, then I saw the detail: they claimed they dont have spare part but as complementary service, they offer me one with 25% discount plus tax. I don't know if this is some type of joke or not. What they expect I respond. I am quite sad to see Leica customer service deal customer case like this. If I am service manage, I will for sure to solve customer problem to meet reasonable expectation. I refuse the \"service\" obviously. I specified that ship the adapter back and make sure every single screw and spring I send with the adapter come back to me so I can DIY fix myself. It is on its way.

I researched all this for a timelapse project that is currently in production. COVID-19 has turned it into a virtual project. I provide technical support and file processing. The director is in a different part of the country, we haven't seen each other in a long time. The architect and construction site are in a different part of the world. The footage looks quite good so far, it's a mix of drone footage and locked-off shots. Make sure you get a barrel plug adapter with a built-in voltage regulator. I use one with my Sigma fp, it's a cable that also works with various Panasonic MFT cameras. The D-Tap battery is for an Atomos recorder, not for the fp (which only needs a battery swap every hour or so in video mode), but it's good to have an all-day power supply for both. Some D-Tap batteries have built-in 7.4V barrel connectors, as do some battery plates. 7.4 Volts is a common voltage for camera batteries. You should ask Leica if they can sell you just the dummy S battery and cable. They may be available as spare parts. Actually, I have a 100Wh D-Tap battery (https://www.hawkwoods.co.uk/Cine/P/GR-100) that don't see too much use. This battery delivers 14.4 V output. So a D-Tap cable with a 14.4 to 7.4 V regulator - like https://woodencamera.com/products/d-tap-to-sony-a7s-a7r-a7sii-a7rii - should do the job. The remaining DIY is then to cut the dummy battery cable on the Leica AC-Adapter-S and remove the dummy battery from eg the Wodden Camera cable adapter, add good-quality connectors so the AC-Adapter-S can be used as intended (powered off the grid), or powered by the 100Wh battery.

Leica still sell two excellent film cameras...the MP and M-A. The price of any comparable used (non-exotic, special edition) Leica M film camera will always be bounded above by the price of these two brand new cameras. For example, it would be irrational for the price of a used M6 to exceed the price of a new MP. Prices are still determined by supply and demand. The demand for film and film cameras has been and continues to steadily increase but the supply of film cameras in particular is decreasing as old cameras die (or are \"fixed\" by arrogant morons who DiY) and are removed from useful circulation. Therefore, prices of film cameras have and may very well continue to increase. Other than Leica and a few plastic toy cameras no new small format cameras are being made by anybody, anywhere and Leica do not seem too interested in producing sufficient quantities to come anywhere near meeting demand...nor, unfortunately, do they seem to be able to reliably produce the small quantities that they do.

Let's assume that all of that is somewhat ok-ish. Hi Hans, thanks again as always for your precious insight. I have done some shades of grey charts tests and I concluded that, if you want to use Zebras to warn you about clipping (about 95% IRE on the waveform as we both observed) while monitoring your L-Log, you have to use the (utterly weird choice) Luma value of 220. That's because, for some reason I can't fathom, Leica seems to have switched to the 8 bits scale (8-225) for the monitoring tools?????? Whilst shooting using L-Log. Whereas when you shoot w/o Log or HLG, the 10 bits scale (0-255) becomes relevant again... irrespective of shooting 10 bits .Mov or 8 Bits .MP4. This also means the lowest value you can choose for Zebras (200) only alows for an IRE equivalent of 80%.... Meaning you can't really have two different zebras setting you can use to expose... WHY????. For those who may not know the trick, you can use zebras at two distincts settings (one to avoid highlight clipping, and another one to properly expose 18% grey or whatever IRE you prefer for skintones). Lumix cameras allows you to show two at the time, and use the more useful IRE (0-105%) scale. The Luma 8bits (8-225) or 10bits (0-255) are only useful for stills in Raw to push your exposure to the right as high as you can before clipping. Not really useful for monitoring Log, especially if Leica doesn't tell us how high L-Log can be exposed before clipping, we are left in the dark and concluded by reverse engeneering that that Value is around 95IRE. Sorry to summon you @Leon_B., but is it possible to clarify this with Leica? SL2(s) is a wonderful platform for stills and video, but I have a feeling we are a bit left in the dark and we need to do an awful amount of DIY to extract the best out of it (L-Log). I am okay-ish with the waveform not displaying data above 95%IRE, but the Luma scale chosen for clipping in Stills is mostly irrelevant and hard to use in Video.@Photoworks@bpLeica@BernardC@frame-it@Aaron Daniel if you care about my 2 cents conclusions: When shooting L-Log, set your camera (and external monitor/recorder if you have) to warn you around 90-95%IRE for clipping highlights. Onboard the camera, the useful value (in Luma 8bits) is now around 220. If you shoot without L-Log, in either 8bits or 10bits (both behave better for a ready-out-of-camera-image now that we can fine tune contrasts/shadow/highlights/IDR) the Waveform scale will look different and display values above 100%, the clipping point is theortically 100IRE.... and The zebra Luma scale is again 10bits (0-255 equiv 0-100%IRE). A smart feature Leica kept is that the waveform monitor and the zebras remain unaffected regardless you use a lut preview in the camera rear-screen or EVF. So you can expose with confidence whilst enjoying framing with a Lut. For HLG, I don't have much experience with it but you can go ahead and enjoy @Stevenincredible videos I believe are mostly shot wih his SL2s using HLG \ud83d\ude0d. It seems the clipping point is 100IRE on the waveform.
