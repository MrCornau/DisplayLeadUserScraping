It's the most valuable entity that I will send by mail and am worried that it will be lost underway. My question to you gents who have done it before, did you send it Certified and did you insure it? And did you package it yourself or had a professional do it for you! The latter is, at least sometimes, important as I have a friend who shipped a very delicate Sculpture and it broke. He got nothing from the insurer as they claimed that it could have been damaged beforehand, or because of his inadequate packaging. Thanks Preben it's a big issue, and maybe only USPS can be trusted, as they are a Federal entity, and therefore they can't really be sleazy as some private companies and get away with it Other solution would be indeed to have a professional packing/shipping company do it for you - ofcourse it will cost more money, but if the item aside has sentimental and monetary value, only the the monetary will be refunded. Do a search about the issue - but not before going to bed.

I have not done the R winder but I have done other devices with rechargeable cells. I just resurrected my Black and Decker cordless vacuum cleaner, where one of the eight LioN cells had a failed discharge protection circuit and was dead. It goes like this: Open up the battery compartment and see if there are any ID marks on the battery but certainly identify the type of battery (NiCad, NiMH or LioN). Measure the diameter, length and see what sort of connection tabs are on the battery and their location, plus if stated on the dead batteries, their capacity in milli-Amp-Hours. Go to the website of an industrial battery supplier like the Small Battery Company in the UK or internationally Alibaba/AliExpress or RS components and find the nearest or exact replacement battery. In general, you can replace NiCad with the higher capacity NiMH (I have done this in cordless shavers and Oral-B toothbrushes). If you cannot find the exact size, go smaller not larger, you can always pack out a smaller battery with heat resistant foam. If you are replacing NiCad with NiMH, using a slightly smaller battery will be more than compensated by the improved battery chemistry. Once you have the new cells, carefully remove the originals using a desoldering pump or wick, with a soldering iron. Solder in the new cells. Use the best quality solder you can get - cheap solder is a false economy. I use Mundorf silver/gold/tin solder. This is not cheap for a whole roll but you can usually buy smaller quantities of this on eBay. If you are using this, you really need a modern thermostatically controlled soldering iron, due to its higher melting point. While you have the battery pack apart, look to see if there are any electrolytic capacitors present in the charging circuit. These deteriorate with time, worse when not used. These should be replaced, with good quality items (search for high quality capacitors on Google. I generally use Panasonic). There will likely also be electrolytic capacitors in the charger. Deterioration of these can reduce battery life dramatically as they cause charging voltage ripple, which is a battery killer, so as the charger is 15-20 years old, these should be replaced.

Each blade is stored in a rolled up position around a rod and is controlled by one of four knobs - when you turn the knob one way the blade unfurls, covering part of the 24mm x 36 mm space in the negative carrier. Depending on how the enlarger is stored, serviced and/or used, the blades could eventually become brittle and more susceptible to breaking (see attached image of a broken unfurled blade). This becomes more of an issue with time but is hardly ever raised or followed up on because few people use the masking function, instead preferring to crop via easel or paper. I could be wrong, but it sounds to me like one of your blades is broken and is now detached from the rod which the knob controls. Many years ago (sometime last century, actually \ud83d\ude2c), I had the same issue with my trusty V35 and managed to take the masking assembly apart. If I recall correctly, the task wasn't particularly challenging - and I wouldn't say I am particularly DIY-minded. The real problem lay in getting hold of replacement blades. Luckily for me, I had a good relationship with Nobby Clark and Bob Herriott of the Service Department at Leica UK, way back in the good old Milton Keynes days. They managed to supply me with the blades. I recall Bob Herriott actually advising that it is best to polish the blades with silicone polish before re-assembling, to allow them to slide more easily. I did as instructed and can confirm that they work perfectly to this day. So, I think you firstly need to determine if a single blade failure is worth the trouble of taking the entire assembly apart. Does the non-functional blade impact the useability of your V35 in any way, or would you just like to fix the blade for the sake of it? Quite frankly, with 3 fully functional blades, you do not really need a fourth. I know several V35s owners who just don't bother fixing broken blades on cost/benefit grounds - the function sees little or no action. Critically, the fault, as you describe it, does not impact workflow.

But they are virtually impossible to find unfortunately. Which air filter did you use, Jac? I found a long filter roll intended to feed a humidifier in our local DIY store, Menards, and they are common everywhere. It was convenient that the material was just the right vertical dimension, so all I had to do was trim the length with scissors. For the Senrac I doubled the material. Note that the Senrac filter box is large and accommodates such a configuration without restricting flow. Maybe I should make pictures of it. --img--  Edited June 10, 2019 by pico", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/298113-diy-film-dryer/?tab=comments#comment-3757169", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "298113-diy-film-dryer", "result": false, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "i found a long filter -----> roll !!!  intended to feed a humidifier in our local diy store, menards, and they are common everywhere.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 101203, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Leicasortedout2019diy"}
