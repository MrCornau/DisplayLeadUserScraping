As you suggest the focus may be fixed; a contrast-based AF would also be a possibility although it could be a bit awkward if the AF of the secondary camera unit was hunting for optimum focus while you were trying to align the optical with the digital image. Suitable camera modules are available off the shelf. Shifting the digital rangefinder patch would probably be achieved digitally \u2013 no moving parts required. They still need to measure the focus position of the lens, though. This might also require occasional recalibration but it could be a DIY affair I suppose. So in principle this could work, but there are a couple of obstacles to be overcome and so far there is nothing to suggest that the Konost team have a real handle on this. The prototype doesn\u2018t sport a viewfinder of any kind and what little they say about the proposed digital RF doesn\u2019t inspire any confidence in me.
