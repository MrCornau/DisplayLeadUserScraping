Dear Kristyansen I can very well understand your thoughts and I have done the step beyond your scenario described. After purchasing my M9 years ago I had a good occasion to buy a MM1, at that time especially for higher ISO capabilities and the fascination of BW workflow. In between the MM1 inspired me to shoot more BW film. And this in the last years I had to take her out consciously. And it was a pleasure each time again. But more and more focussing on BW film workflow (which film type, which exposure, which developer) my MM1 became more and more neglected. On the other hand I shoot often in family events like weddings etc (okay now in COVID times not) and often struggle a bit with the acceptable ISO capabilities for my taste. So during more than a year I grew my decision to upgrade to a M10 or M10-R model. That finally happened one month ago with a good deal on a used M10 that cost me 1000\u20ac more than the price I got for my MM1 that I have sold before. And for me it was the totally right decision. The M10 just feels like two evolution steps farther than the M9: everything a little better but nothing missing. Unfortunately I had no occasion until now to try it on family events and this will probably be the situation until next spring. But my first trials show me that 2 steps ISO higher will deliver at least equal picture quality. So instead of using f/1.4@1/30s I can take pictures with f/2@1/60s and get better focused and less blurred pictures. On the other hand I only use film (and even only one sort from now on: Kodak Double-X from 100-1600 ISO) when \u201creally\u201d shoot BW. I think for BW capabilities the M10 will deliver excellent quality, too as eben does my M9. And real-life difference to MM1 can be only found in 1:1 comparisons. Just the thing that is not really missing if you don\u2019t have but that might become enchanting if you have it. I hope my post does help you in one or another way. Best regards.

Sure, it may be some effect from the sensor structure, but that\u2019s not good. I have not seen that on anything from a phone to a 100 mp medium format. Unfortunately the grid pattern sensor reflections happen with a lot of modern mirrorless cameras, including the GFX line with GF lenses. I've seen them on every mirrorless system I've used \u2013 X100V, GFX 50S/R, Canon RP/R/Ra/R6/R5, and Leica Q (don't remember seeing them on the SL, though). Depending on the lens (seems easier to conjure with wide angles), f-stop (f/16+) and the angle/intensity of the sun, it can be anywhere from mild to severe enough to completely ruin a shot. But I have to say it doesn't look nearly as bad on a monochrome sensor as it does on a color sensor. If you want to see the grid pattern on another system, take a look at the DPR sample images from their review of the Fujifilm GF 30 lens \u2013 it's pretty jarring in one of the shots. If you haven't seen this pattern yet, you're either still using a DSLR or haven't encountered the right situation. Usually when I get this pattern, I open the lens back up to at least f/8 or change my orientation/composition until the pattern goes away.
