As a matter of fact, I have. And I hereby repeat my request for you to provide us with an example where said \"nuances\" exist, so we can evaluate our eyes' skills and compare them to yours. Many people, including non-photographers, perceive a difference. So do I. But I don't perceive any differences which are actually rooted in sensor technology. I just perceive differences between cameras' outputs\u2014which can be eliminated through appropriate processing. So in the end, there is nothing to be found in images from CCD sensors which cannot be had in images from CMOS sensors just as well. No intrinsic advantage in CCD sensors ... but a lot of intrinsic disadvantages (no live view, poor high-ISO performance, etc.). Some will say, well, the additional effort required for CMOS images to make them look like CCD images is a point in favour of CCD. But in my opinion, that's a foolish point of view because the effort required can be made as small as applying a custom profile, script, or action. Just a mouseclick or two. And I'm not only referring to the final outputs, but also to the behaviour of the files under post processing. At this point, you're losing me. What is \"behaviour of files under post-processing\" supposed to mean? Flexibility? Resilience? Malleableness? Effort required to come up with the desired final result? In all these points, I am seeing the advantages on the CMOS side of things ... or at the very least, no disadvantages. Then again, like you, I hope I haven't stepped on anybody's \"toes\". I'm afraid I stepped on yours. My apologies, I didn't mean to offend you ... much less as I always adored your photographs.

I always knew that it was going to be a long shot, but I decided it was worth trying when I realized that every single CMOS sensor-based camera I evaluated (and I've owned and used all of the headlining ones) was inferior to the M9/M-E at base ISO levels. Leica is in possession of a wonderful sensor that sets them apart from the competition. This is important. It is with great interest therefore that I follow their efforts to fix the corrosion issue. And I would be elated of course if they offered an updated CCD sensor in a future M camera.

My algorithm compresses the data values using the DNG-8 compression scheme, then restores the value using the decompression routine. It takes this restored value and subtracts it from the uncompressed/original value. This gives a measure of the Data Lost by the DNG-8 that is preserved in M8RAW2DNG.

For values that are on a boundary, naturally occurring noise can cause the compressed value to fluctuate.

Good to find this forum and hope to learn more from other members and to perhaps share some of my opinions as we. I have been using the Leica R system for nearly 30 years (1978 to about 2004), built up a good collection of lenses (from 35mm to 280 f2.8 modular lens. a couple of zooms as well) I had every model from the R3Mot to the R7 but finally decided let go of the system because my eyesight was getting worse (required auto focus) and the Leica R8 and R9 were just ridiculously large . I have since moved onto Canon (started with the 300D and kept upgrading till the 5D3) and then moved to Fujifilm when they launched the XE1. Currently on my 3rd XT1 (lost one, gave one away and finally bought a silver edition). I think Fuji has got it right in most aspects. I now have most of the new fuji lenses and find them to be very close to the Leica quality and feel. I still loved the Leica lenses and have been waiting patiently since I dropped the system; for Leica to come up with a proper autofocus camera but alas I have been disappointed to date.
