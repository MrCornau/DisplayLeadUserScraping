I print large, and find 24mp to be very limiting for a 300dpi printer output. I can only imagine how good my 50 APO would be on a higher MP body for large prints. That lens (by itself) has certainly bumped up image quality from my M240 markedly, and the 50 APO lens for me has been worth every penny of cost, but for landscapes (and subjects with fine detail) the main weak spot for me of this \"system\" is low megapixel count. I've tried the Nikon D800, and even with a flapping DSLR mirror, there was no problem at all with getting pin sharp images off that 36mp sensor. I'd guess this would be even easier off a lower vibration rangefinder. If not an M with higher megapixel count, i would really hope that such resolution progress is made in the auto-focused SL or S ranges. I am recent Leica user with the purchase of my first Leica, the M10 in Nov. 2017. I'm still getting the hang of the system and manual focusing. For the past 4+ years, I have been a Fuji user. I do all of my printing on Epson inkjet printers. My current printer is the Epson P800 which handles paper up to 17\" wide. I have 16x20 prints from cropped images created with the Fuji X100S (16 mp files) and the image quality and sharpness is remarkable. I cannot tell the difference from prints made with this little camera and those hanging next to it made from my old Canon 5D Mk III system. If anyone here is serious about image quality and making prints larger than 20x30 inches, they should be using medium format gear. For my needs the M10 24mp files are more than adequate. The prints that I have made so far are amazing. Larger prints really show off the sharpness and micro-contrast of the Leica M prime lenses. I'm hooked. If you want the equivalent of buying a higher megapixel camera and you are a Lightroom user, I suggest that you try out Capture One Pro 11. I switched to Capture One Pro about 3 years ago because Lightroom didn't do such a great job with Fuji X trans sensor RAW files. Switching to Capture One Pro at that time was an immediate improvement in image quality and processing workflow speed. The last couple releases of Capture One Pro, now at version 11, have greatly improved layers and the DAM capabilities of the program. Good enough for my needs at least.

Do you try to shoot at specific ISO's to achieve a certain look? I've been trying to find raws to play with but can't find many. I have no experience of the M246, but I've been shooting with an MM1 for more than five years. I've never really hit the limits of the camera. I've been shooting digital cameras since 2001 (Nikon D1), and had got used to my digital camera being quickly superseded by something much better. The M Monochrom mk1 is the first digital camera where I've felt that not to be the case. If you do go for the MM1, my recommendations are: 1) Never go above 3200 ISO 2) Always shoot DNG files and save as TIFFs 3) 1600 ISO is the sweet spot for some grit and grain. Looks very filmic to my eyes 4) Get some good quality ND filters to really get the most out of the camera 5) Use the histogram on the LCD screen - I've found it to be accurate, reliable, and easy to use.

It is a used M9 with recently replaced CCD (i believe this is the post 2015 new design, which is not prone to corrosion). As I received the camera, noticed that there are sensor dusts, no surprise there. Used rocket blower, which moved the dusts around instead of removing them... After some research, I decided to give the Eyelead gel stick a try. I see that there are two versions, the original blue one and the orange one for Sony/Leica. I talked to a tech person from the Leica Miami store, and he recommended the blue one. He was pretty confident that the blue one works well on M9, and wouldn't cause problem like leaving residual on the sensor. He also mentioned that the blue one is what the Miami store and Leical Germany use. Because Leica Miami doesn't carry the orange one and it is out of stock at photographylife, I decided to go with the blue one and i will receive it in a couple days. Before I actually stick the thing on the sensor, just want to get everyone's opinion on how to properly use it. Based on what I've read, stick it on the sensor gently, don't pull up but try to wobble it to unstick, and don't drag on the sensor either. Is this right? I have seen a older post from jaapv that he had good experience with the blue one for Leica. I am wondering if anything changed recently so that one has use the orange one instead? The notice from photographylife makes me worry as it states that newer Leica sensor, including the m9 new design i assume, is not safe with the blue one... Also, about corrosion - after using the blower, while most dusts moved around, there is one stayed at the same spot (circled in black in the attach picture, 200% zoom). Looks like a dust to me but the small 'white halo' around it makes me worry a bit. The one sitting in the green circle is a new dust after using the blower. Anything suggestion is appreciated.

I bought my M9 as a retirement gift in 2010, and use it just like a film Leica with lenses I bought in 1969. After 7 years I heard about the sensor corrosion issue, and checking closely found a couple of tiny spots that looked like the issue, so I sent it to Leica to evaluate. It took a few months, but came back like new, with the new corrosion resistant sensor at no charge (policy has changed now). Now I also have an M10 (and a Sony A7 for my old SLR lenses), but the M9 still gives stunning images, if you keep the ISO set to the low end (say 1250 max).

(Leica also replaced sensors with the old style before the new one was ready, so just \"replaced sensor\" may not mean the new style.) The M9 is at its best with 35 & 50 lenses, and I use 35 on it more, while on film used 50 more. The Zeiss ZM 35 f2.0 Biogon is a good match to the M9, and mine is sharper than my (older) Summicron. Likewise the Zeiss 50 f2 ZM Planar is pretty equal to the current 50 Summicron, but a bargain price. The M9 can benefit from faster lenses because of the ISO limitation, and I've actually enjoyed and gotten great images from the Voigtlander 35 f1.4 Nokton, which is very small, styled like the original 35 Summilux from the 1960s. The Nokton has barrel distortion and focus shifts to the rear as it is stopped down, but is nice to use on the M9, especially in dim light where the focus shift isn't an issue. It's also about the cheapest 35. The Voigtlander 50 Nokton 1.5 (Asph) is a fine performing fast 50, (and lower cost) but the very narrow focus ring takes some getting used to. I've been using it more on my M9. Image quality is quite close to Leica or Zeiss, and construction quality is very good. For Leica lenses I now prefer the Summarit f2.5 lenses in 35 & 50 for their small size, great handling, and good flare resistance.

Found backfocus with a constant amount of turn of the focus ring to focus correctly, so I trusted I would be able to correct that. As suggested earlier in this thread that the cam could be polished is wrong when the lens backfocusses! The cam is too short, not too long. So, in very small steps I compressed the cam of the lens by tapping on it with a small hammer, using a flat headed pin (diameter 3 mm) exactly in the middle where it (when mounted) rests agains the rangefinder wheel of the camera. The other side of the cam was supported well with a steel flat object. This compression makes the cam a bit longer (just a few hundredth of a mm) and now the lens focusses exact throughout the range of focussing, from 1 meter to infinity. It took me about half an hour to correct it. It is not necessary to take the lens apart. There is enough room for the pin to reach the cam from the inside when the lens is set to infinity. The outside of the cam is supported by the steel flat object. the lens is supported with a bean bag for instance. So perhaps worthwhile for those who feel they have an overpriced paperweight. --img--  But beware: you need only light hammer taps to get the effect needed. If you did too much, you can file it off with a very fine diamond-powdered file, but when you take your time, that is not needed. Tap not quite at the edge of the cam, you want the edge to remain smooth, just about 2 or 3 mm away from the edge with the pin lightly resting on it. Here an example of how well it focusses, taken at f/1.1, focussed on the lips (square crop at full height taken with the M9, no post-processing): click (I dremel coded the lens as a Noctilux 1.0) The lens certainly is worth being corrected, because it is very sharp indeed. Ok - I know this is a very old post, however I have just made this adjustment using a 25mm socket as the 'anvil' (which exactly matched the radius of the focus cam) and a wide blade screwdriver as the 'punch' and with the lens suitably supported so all impact goes only into the focus cam/tab - with some very gentle tapping it brought the back focus forward to precise focus on my M10. Very happy with the results coming off the lens now and absolutely bang on all the way through the focus range.

In the center, they are about equally sharp, maybe a slight edge for the Otus. The Otus is optimized for sharpness, the Summilux-SL for depth rendering, not the same as as 3D-Pop, a horrible word. To my eyes, the Summilux-SL beats the Otus by a mile in terms of depth rendering. Where the Otus really shines is in low light situations on a sensor like the one in the \u03b17R II/III due to a combination of extremely high sharpness, and high pixel count, high DR, excellent low light performance of FF BSI sensors (not rocket science for companies like TowerJazz to make for the SL2, I think). By the way, I find that the Sigma Art holds up really well in terms of resolution and OOF treatment agains the other two. For accuracy, one has to focus the Sigma Art manually, though. Still, it's incredible value for money. I didn\u2019t check thoroughly for CA/PF but the Otus showed a bit more wide open. It could be that the Summilux-SL is software corrected in this respect. Removing the opcodes doesn\u2019t make a difference here, but the corrections could be baked into the raw. The \u2018optical\u2019 performance of the Summilux-SL is so impressive, I actually don\u2019t care. Also, the corner to corner comparisons between the Zeiss and the Leica were done with the opcode distortion corrections applied to the Summilux-SL. It showed no visible loss of resolution to my eyes. The loss of resolution in the extreme corners wide open is \u2018more visible\u2019 when the lens profile in LR is applied to the Otus than comparing the extreme corners of the Summilux-SL with and without the opcodes.

It's such an eye opener for me. I have done lens test/comparison before, but often time, it's not as easy to spot the difference as yours. Maybe the Leica is just that good! Paul, As far as I am concerned the SL body is fantastic. It is a little bit heavier than Sony, Hasselblad X1D and Fuji X-H1 but not that much. Ergonomically IMO the grip can be improved and following the rounded comments from Kaufman I suspect that is what will happen as well once the SL2 comes along. I fail to understand though why Leica in addition to heavy zooms and heavy reference lenses cannot at the same time release smaller and lighter primes as well. After all most of Leica's reputation is based upon delivering the highest optical quality in a small package. Why only apply that to the TL/CL and not to the SL? It doesn't make sense to me. As you have noticed the Hasselblad X1D is making huge inroads. Why? Because Hasselblad packs a larger higher resolution sensor in a smaller package with lighter and cheaper lenses, still maintaining fantastic image quality. We are now 6 lenses in to the SL-system and the average weight is 1,077g. Sorry, simply too much... Thanks, Joris. It will take time Joris. Clearly, they didn't go for another Summilux release but switched to a set of APO Cron. The Elmarit/Elmar will follow. I feel the SL mirrorless system is the most flexible system Leica has right now. If you want to go extremely small, you need to adapt the M-mount lenses at the moment. But the option is there. If you want unequal performance in the 135 format, you have the native SL lenses. SL system is still at its infancy, but from where I am looking at it, you already have much more flexibility than Sony/Olympus/Fuji/Panasonic had back then. And I'm shooting mainly with Sony but I'm keeping a keen eye on the SL development. The Cron set seems to be what I want to get at a later date.

it doesn't make sense to me. as you have noticed the hasselblad x1d is making huge inroads. why? because hasselblad packs a larger higher resolution sensor in a smaller package with lighter and cheaper lenses, still maintaining fantastic image quality. we are now 6 lenses in to the sl-system and the average weight is 1,077g. sorry, simply too much... thanks, joris. it will take time joris. clearly, they didn't go for another summilux release but switched to a set of apo cron. the elmarit/elmar will follow. i feel the sl mirrorless system is the most flexible system leica has right now. if you want to go extremely small, you need to adapt the m-mount lenses at the moment. but the option is there. if you want unequal performance in the 135 format, you have the native sl lenses. sl system is still at its infancy, but from where i am looking at it, you already have much more flexibility than sony/olympus/fuji/panasonic had back then. and i'm shooting mainly with sony but i'm keeping a keen eye on the sl development. the cron set seems to be what i want to get at a later date. i'm puzzled however by the decision of normalizing the size of the lenses. clearly the system is not meant for video only, and doing this would greatly limit the flexibility down the road for a wider or longer focal length.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 28920, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 416336, "autor": "dkCambridgeshire", "date": 1529150640000, "content": "Another visit to the pond yesterday: Late afternoon there were no mating/ovipositing damselflies - but there were several Four-Spotted Chaser dragonflies flying - which invariably fly back to the same bankside perch every few minutes.

I hope others who may have passed up the camera previously find the article and give the X Vario a try! Thanks for the review. I concur with most of what you say. Couple of things, though: To be able to give the X-Vario \"a try\" these days as you say, there needs to be some sort of supply. There really isn't. In the US, Tamarkin, Popflash, Leica Miami, Leica SF, Ken Hansen etc., they don't have any (or maybe the odd one sample?). EBay may be your friend, but then you need to calculate your risk. Either the production run wasn't very large, or people actually hold on to them, I am not sure. Re the shooting envelope, with some decent technique, it is possible to go way lower than /125 of a second. I have shots (good ones, too, I think), which were done at /30 or even /15. Re the upper ISO limits, I agree that you may want to keep things below a certain number, but with DXO Prime NR for example, 6.400 or even 12.500 are just fine, b/w wise. Have a look at #35/36 here: http://hahn.zenfolio.com/xv , these were done in LR5.3 for example. Peter Karb should read Peter Karbe. Karbe's second point in that interview is actually very interesting: he says they wanted to achieve \"Constant imaging quality from the minimum focusing distance to infinity.\" I would add that they achieved that at all f-stops, too, which is truly amazing (before diffraction sets in, that is). I am a fan of the EVF, especially titled vertically. It's like my old Hassy with the chimney viewfinder, the eye is able to really concentrate and take in the subject without any contamination from the immediate environment. \"image quality is more than sufficient for most\" is a big statement, I would not dare speak for \"most\", myself. People's needs are just very different, and while the Vario-Elmar lens may - optically speaking - be the best zoom lens bolted onto any all-in-one camera, it is also of course the slowest (focal length 50 at f5.1 !!) The implementation of MF is brilliant in my view. Just turn the barrel, check the magnifying pane, and away you go. Simple and solid, even in low light. I agree about the addition of a grip or a case to hold the darn thing. Before the firmware update, it wasn't possible to disable the multi-controller/menu wheel, which always got bumped by the palm of one's hand and put the camera into a different mode altogether. I always apply some sharpening to the files, the DNG's take it very well. Shooting JUST JPGs is actually for the first time possible on a digital Leica (IMHO). They come out quite nicely, and are reasonably malleable in post. B/W JPGs, in-camera, with contrast set to High and sharpness set to Medium high, yields excellent results (combined with spot or center weighted metering). I never trusted the JPGs on my M9/M240, or even the X2. I wonder how many people use the XV as a street photography tool.

After years of optically testing lenses and camera AF systems (due to specific and often demanding requirements of mine), I would not use a human, animal or any moving subject as a test target to determine a camera or lens's focusing accuracy. I would start with a series of say aluminum cans like soda or beer cans (don't drink the beer while testing or you are bound to have a lot of focusing anomalies --img--  ). Stagger them out in a straight line at a 45 degree angle with fairly close spacing of the cans. There are of course lens align tools to determine mis focusing to make things easier. for a camera or lens to misfocus, generally means it front or back focuses or the Af sensor in the given camera is too broad and doesn't always accurately pic of the precise spot you focused on. The Leica S often has had the exact same issue you have noticed in your XV. My comments are generalities to testing and beyond this initial test I described, it's then important to determine how precise the camera's sensor is in its coverage of the test target or does it more broadly cover a greater area. Often times the sensor is not aligned with the viewfinders green box's location. Leica has often found S cameras that were sent in for Af errors, well within spec and returned such cameras, only to have the user continue to have Af errors. It's apparent all of these Leica cameras are unlike the Nikon/Cannon type cameras we are used to, af wise and knowing the parameters to get proper focus, is the key to its success. As I mentioned in your thread of your review of the X Vario, I more often use the camera in af mode and have been pleasantly surprised regarding its accuracy.
