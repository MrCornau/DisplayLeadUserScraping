CCD is dying out in the evolution of sensors and this is for the reasons already mentioned. Economics will prevent resurrection, because Leica would be foolish to syphon of R&D funds that could be put into other products with a larger market, even if that product is the only FF M they make. I love my Monochrom, but not because of its CCD. Does it have something special, especially at base ISO? Maybe. Does it matter much in the grand scheme of things? No. We will have to wait for the M240 Monochrom for the comparisons to begin again! As for colour and look, I personally find the Sony sensors in the A7 and A7R rather nice. Colour is spot on, colour depth tremendous and there is IMHO much more to be gained with the additional DR and other merits than would be gained by tiny subjective improvements in base performance and colour on a CCD. The problem is not CMOS. The problem is the quality of the images produced by it in the case of each camera release. IMHO, the Sony sensors show what can be done. As for the OP's assertion that most photos are taken at base ISO, I do not think this is true for a lot of people. In one of the last portfolios I produced, the most used ISO was 800...

I find it tricky to explain in forum posts sometimes without talking in person, drawing diagrams and the like. So I can't agree with you as light 'spillage' would affect the shadows as well as mid-tones and highlights and would reduce overall contrast (which it does on earlier designs and to a slight extent on some Mandler designs). Of course it can. As you say, \"- in practice always less than 100% due to some, albeit small, degree of flare.\" So a large degree of flare would reduce it more than a small amount. Although what you call flare, I generalised to \"spillage\" to include other aberrations. But as you say, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and allowing flare to reduce contrast to extend the dynamic range that can be captured isn't a viability I'm afraid (if it was lens designers would design such lenses and use software to readjust the contrast after....). Of course it is. A lens that reproduced the contrast in a scene perfectly would render a scene with 15 stops of DR as 15 stops, and therefore clip one or both ends. A lens with reduced contrast (by whatever means) would render the scene with less contrast. It is the same principle as pre-exposing film to bring up the shadows while the highlights remain in check. They did design such lenses, such as the rigid summicron, which had higher sharpness and lower contrast than the lens that replaced it. Contrast can only be increased after the fact however, a clipped highlight or shadow is clipped. But then the no free lunch thing comes to bite you and people want more contrast, better flare suppression, and so on. So I'm still interested in an explanation regarding the smoothness of tonality from Mandler lenses. My explanation is that the Mandler lenses are at the sweet spot of lens design, with just enough correction but not too much.

As far as I can find out, unlike the M and S cameras, the SL does not have the possibility of specifying the folder name on the SD card. This is a pity, as it is a useful feature that I have used on the M P 240. But what is worse, and quite unorthodox, is that the SL increments the folder number every time the SD card is formatted in the camera, at least my SL does so. Meaning that if you have a shoot and have just imported your images, and the last one i L1000367, and you format the card in the SL, the next image becomes L1010368. If you then format again, the next image will be L1020369. I am surprised why this behavior was not spotted by the beta reviewers, and if it was, why Leica did not correct this strange numbering scheme in the first \"production\" fimware? Anyone else seen this or is it just my camera? Is there a setting to avoid this? Resetting the numbering, sets the first image number to L1000001, which is not a good idea either.

The X2 originally cost \u00a31450 in the UK but now can be bought new for just under \u00a31000. The VF costs about \u00a3200 Using the optical finder you can switch off the screen if you wish. Brightline Viewfinder 36mm for Leica X1 and X2, Ref. 18707 280,- (Pound Sterling) I should like to ask is there anyone on the forum who has changed from a Fuji X100 to a Leica ( that is to say an X1 or 2.) Whilst the X100 is a first class camera I have never really liked it. Far too many variables to adjust. I fancy the idea of the add on optical viewfinder and forgetting all the electronic variations. In other words mimicking a film camera! Am I right or is it a silly thought! Yes, I have been there: X100, X100s, X-Pro1, X-E1 and X-T1 I once had a Leica M8.2 and sold it in preparation of upgrading to the M9. However, this was during the time when Leica had a 6 months or so delivery time and I gave up waiting and got distracted by a series of Japanese cameras including the Fujis. Should not have sold that M8.2 because it must have taken me 4 or so years to make a roundtrip back to the M8.2. The Fujis (X-Trans or not) are not bad cameras, but the 23mm Fujinon f2.0 lens is easily beaten by the X1/X2 Elmarit 24/2.8. There are three generations of X100 cameras and Fuji has never changed the lens except for introducing 1/3 aperture clicks on the latest X100t model. The major weak spot of the Fujinon is close up performance wide open where it will show a (IMHO) rubbish image which Fuji people call \"dreamy character\". The X1 and X2 cameras are well suited for use with an optical viewfinder because the screen can be configured to stay off and there is a green LED that will be visible in the corner of our eye (while looking through the optical viewfinder) and that will signal AF lock on. Obviously, you'd either shoot hyperfocal or use the 11 point AF/face detection... although it is not too difficult to guess where the 1 spot AF area is in the optical viewfinder. I suggest buying the Leica Brightline viewfinder because it is better than most of the other third party viewfinders (much better than the Olympus VF1, better than the Voigtl\u00e4nder viewfinders). People have argued back and forth between the Leica X1 and the X100 back in their times. I will agree that the X100 hybrid viewfinder is a nice piece of technology, bet let's take a more detailed look at this: what exactly do you need to see in your viewfinder while composing with a fixed focal length camera like the Leica X1/X2? - aperture will be on the Leica's dedicated wheel - shutter speed is nice, but auto ISO will eliminate the need to see this - battery, image no., etc.- not while I am composing The only thing I'd probably miss is the EV value if I used it often (which I don't).
