What I've learnt is that two healthy batteries stored properly and used evenly in rotation is better than a stockpile of 4 or 5 (or more) batteries which are unused. I've purchased cameras used with up to 6 batteries \"free\", but the extra batteries count for nothing if they are all dead. I shot my M240 rather heavily for almost 5 years and two batteries served me fine (over 30-40k frames?) with no discernible drop in battery life. Anyway, the camera will likely die before the original two batteries (one with the camera and spare) truly go kaput, if the batteries maintained through the lifetime (rotated for use, stored properly, not dropped). Now Leica product cycles are 4 to 5 years, so at the tail end of those cycles you may wish to pick up another couple of batteries lest the new model uses a newer battery type. I do recall camera companies generally extending serviceability of a camera 5 to 10 years after the camera is discontinued (depending on manufacturer), in which case even if a new model is released with new batteries, the older model's batteries should continue to be sold until the camera is no longer serviceable. If the new model uses the same batteries, then you're in luck. Now I myself have overthought this. Basically 2 batteries for me. Another 1 or 2 every 5 years if I stick with that camera.

I don't expect any camera manufacturer to support sensors after fifteen years, even if the camera was $7000 new. Analog cameras are a different story because any skilled repair person could keep it running long past it's introduction. Digital cameras require proprietary tools and equipment to maintain repairs. Most of those repairs are not repairs at all, but replacement of assemblies, no different than a computer. Now if Leica is still repairing or maintaining cameras at twice the cost of purchasing a used working camera, good for them. However, as a professional user I don't see that as a good ROI if I'm paying $2000+ in repairs for a camera that has a resale value of well less than $1500. YMMV. Just a point about batteries - I have a Nikon D1X and as far as I know new Nikon original batteries are no longer available. There is however one big difference in that the Nikon can be run with an external power source. I have my Nikon set to use a Quantum Turbo battery with a Quantum D1,D1X,D1H lead and it works perfectly.

I use the S-system for work (I'm just a basic freelance photographer), and thus far I've always passed off my bodies to Leica Service here in Ginza, Tokyo to clean the sensors. With the Leica reputation in connection to sensor cover glass, I have not taken any chances. Leica Ginza usually do the job for nothing (quick clean)---anything more involved that'd require a service charge can be written down on my expenses, so I do that and save myself the hassle. All good. {It's also better for me to put the liability more squarely on them, just in-case any sensor cover glass problems did arise: I do not want to eat the Leica after-service tax infamous in these parts---I'm only half joking.} However! Leica Ginza has been effectively shut down since 8th April and doesn't look like going back to normal service anytime soon. My sensors really need a clean, so I'll have to take matters into my own hands. Not scared about it, but I want to get this right in the least number of iterations. Please lend me your expertise m(. .)m I have just tried the Pentax O-ICK1 on my backup S2-P body today. The O-ICK1 (great name) is a kind of dry-clean implement, for anyone unfamiliar. Didn't go well. I had more dust on the sensor after cleaning than before! (I held myself back from doubling down and trying again) So it looks as though that was \u00a53,000 down the tubes. No great shakes, but I'm looking for a different and better way now... I'm in Japan so many of the products available to guys in the West, that turn up on Google searches of this topic, don't seem to be available for me here. I checked older threads and saw a Visible Dust swab made for 30mm sensors (dunno if specifically for the 30x45 Leica Pro Format, but anyway...) which I can't get my hands on in Japan. So I'm looking for workarounds. I've never wet cleaned a sensor myself before, so please forgive my ignorance and beginner questions: 1) Can I just use a full-frame swab? Does the edge of a swab leave a line? Assuming yes, otherwise there would be no market for different sensor size swabs.. or is it all FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) from the sensor cleaning-industrial complex? 2) Can I just wrap a lens cleaning paper on a bit of stiff card or plastic, some isopropyl alcohol on the thin edge, and DIY myself a swab? The one remaining dry-clean solution (that I know of) I haven't tried is a sensor brush, like one of those Arctic Butterfly brushes---how do we feel about those? That specific product is not readily available here, although there seem to be copycat brush products (which surely perform just as well). What is the main thing I am looking for in a sensor brush? (materials, size, etc) I can't say whether the majority of the spots on my sensors are dust or oil, etc., but blowing is not doing the trick so I definitely need to do something more proactive to deal with whatever it is. My two camera bodies are the S typ006 and S2-P, both have had new sensors in them to replace defective gen1 versions, so the cover glass on there is whatever spec the replacement CCDs come with.

It was either expensive to get processed or a pain for DIY. I came to the conclusion that unless you want to project B&W from an incandescent light mechanical projector, it is just as easy to take the easily and/or cheaply processed B&W negative and invert it in Photoshop after scanning. You can then project it from a digital projector (I have a 1080P Mitsubishi one). It is not like scanning colour negative, where after years and trying all sorts of software and PS actions, I still cannot get the colour 100% to my taste. I therefore take mostly reversal for colour. I used to use Agfa Precisa CT100 (Provia emulsion on a warming substrate) until it was withdrawn about 18 months ago.

If Canon makes Cameras who can last that long I guess Leica can do too. And the cost of service and repairs is not even close. I sold 5D as soon as I read about end of support announcement.

My M9-P was refurbished less than a year ago, the sensor is new, it won't corrode. Now, if I had a 2015 ME and Leica says sorry, your camera is \"unrepairable, take the trade-in\" I would simply sell it on my own and move to another brand. I wouldn't give another dime to a company that let me with a 5-year old $5000 brick. Just this month by my own mistake I broke my Smeg toaster, it was out of warranty, but I called customer service and I send it to the repair facility (Fedex shipping was paid by them) fixed my toaster, and not only I that, they send me a new one for free. Yes I know, we are talking 150 USD toasters, but the point is, maybe Leica could do better especially with those owners whose cameras are relative new, 5-year old or less. Maybe a demo M240 as a straight trade with NO money involved. My M-E 220 was purchased new in Moscow (autumn 2016) and went for new sensor in 2018 via Downtown Camera in Toronto.

Not only are the issues with the M8 and 9 annoying for their owners but these issues deter people from buying an M. I would not hesitate to buy an 18MP M9 if I could see it as a camera that one could expect to use for another troublefree 5 years or more. Instead one can expect to buy a lot of problems. So I use my M lenses on Fuji Xpro's, sad. Call me frugal but for the price of even a secondhand M I like to expect years of trouble free use. Even if users decide to bin their Leica because of digital rot after a couple of years, the factory should make them to last. That is why it is a Leica. Unfortunately Leica themselves appear to underline the 'disposability' of their cameras by ending the free replacement of te affected M9 sensors. If you stand behind your product and you messed up, you should replace the sub standard parts, even after 10 years. Funny that the beautiful 60 year old rangefinder design in an M9 will still work after 30 years while the camera is useless. Maybe Leica should make modular M cameras, where the user can replace the sensor and engine module. And maybe this is the best they can do to survive in a market where cameras became expensive disposables. I am happy I decided to keep my film Rolleiflexes, Hasselblads, etc. If you google enough you will find DIY instructions for how to place FF Sony A7 sensor into film M. Current state of electronics and 3D printing allows to do it. But I'm waiting for Leica made retrofit kit to install global shutter into film M. This will allow to use film M bodies without spending hundreds on CLA and even more hundreds on set of new curtains. Also, to me, \"keep\" and \"use\" are two different things. I simply can't use film M as digital M. I like to take a show up stroll with fancy film camera, but I just don't have time to process, scan and else with film. To me the result is the major point of using and having photo camera. With film I like pictures because it is simply nice on film. But if I need the content, I have better chances with digital.

An A7 sensor and better, an original retrofit kit sounds interesting. I am an amateur photographer, so I have the luxury of not having to deliver. Having said that, I don't like to spend hours on PP, but developing a film ( or having it done somewhere) and then scan the few ones you think you like is not very time consuming. I think the best part of film/slide for me is the fact that you have to deliver while you take the picture, so I am more conscious of perfect exposure, etc. This intensifies the experience for me.
