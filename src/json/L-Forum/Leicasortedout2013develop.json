Regarding film: Several weeks shouldn't be a problem for Delta 100, several months ... well I'm not so sure, I personally wouldn't risk it. Developer: Are you sure the developer is bad after two months? A change in color does not necessarily mean that the developer has turned bad. The Ilford datasheet says that Ilfosol 3 should be good for 4 months in half filled bottles at cool to normal (4-20\u00b0C) ambient temperatures. I guess you could further improve the storage properties by using a protective gas and/or dividing the concentrate into smaller portions that you store in appropriate glass bottles.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/209085-storing-unprocessed-exposed-film/?tab=comments#comment-2377234", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "209085-storing-unprocessed-exposed-film", "result": false, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "if i develop -----> film !!!  as soon as it is exposed this puts me under pressure to use 10 or 11 films within two months.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 107389, "year": "2013"}, {"autor": "Hugh 38", "date": "2013-05-10 17:06:00", "content": " About two weeks ago I road tested a new purchase , an R4s mod 2 with a vario Elmar 35 to 70 ( ??) and used a roll of Ilford Pan F .
