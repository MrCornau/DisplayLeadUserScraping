I don't recall if I wrote the following in this thread or another one: in the old Photo Net Leica forum, people often wrote that a 35mm Tri-X image should not, or could not, be printed larger than 8x10 or 11x14 \u2014 that you should shoot medium format if you wanted larger prints. Then, in 2006, I saw the Daido Moriyama retrospective exhibition at the Gallery of New South Wales: 150x100 cm (60 x 40 inch) prints from 35mm Tri-X negatives: printed on an wide format inkjet printer, they were stunning. That is to say, I prefer the 35 mm aesthetic and don't want greater resolution that my M10 provides. I also prefer to have 24 MB rather than 40 MB files, so that I don't have to shoot at higher shutter speeds to keep definition. As for the M10R having greater dynamic range than the M10, some people feel that the M10 has slightly more dynamic range, as shown in the graphs on the photonstophotos.net charts, especially the Photographic Dynamic Range Shadow Improvement Charts. ____________________Frog Leaping photobook You could not have said it better, and I feel the same way than you right now. I really hesitated for a few days to upgrade, and this was my reasoning: Pros: -The R will hold value better for when its time trade it in for the M11. -The extra resolution -The slightly better DR and IQ as reported by early adopters My biggest hesitation, as I stated on multiple occasion, was that the image would be too sharp, too digital, too clinical, and that it would not please me as much as my beloved M10P. This is why you comment resonates with me a lot. I prefer the 35mm 24MP look. I know how to work with it, and I know I already like it. With the 10R, I take a risk to like it less. On top of that, I saw some shots on that popular Instagram photographer Andre Josselin today (its on his stories, so hurry up if you want to see as well before its gone). He recently got his hands on the M10R. His first posts with it today, if you omit the flare created by his Voigtlander 35mm Nokton, look like they were taken on an A7RIV. The DR is too perfect, the image is too sharp, there are so many details ! some may like it, but I much preferred his M10/M240 previous work. So it helped me made my mind. Regarding the value, sure, the 10R will sell better than the 10P in 2 years, but that didn't take into account the money I will lose upfront in the P to R upgrade lol! So for now, here's my setup: M10P for my \"authenticity\" needs - Q2 for my thirst of MP, but at least I get autofocus, a beautiful lens, and Macro mode with it for a maximum of versatility - A7SIII for video What else can a man ask for ?

Promoting the spending of thousands of dollars on a new camera based on a bit more headroom drops my jaw, if you don't see the irony when you are a beta tester for Leica then there is no hope for anybody listening to you. Sure some people will follow the scent, but the M10R is even more temporary and even more pointless for the majority of photographers than most of Leica's offerings in recent times. If this was a specialist discussion about theatre photography or similar I could imagine the extra headroom of an M10R may be a vital element, but for 99% of Leica photographers on this forum it won't make any difference at all other than the bank balance, even if they pixel peep. Thousands of dollars for that? It is symptomatic across the industry that the old camera is now not fit for purpose because hey, you may just meet those situations you never even considered or complained about before. Big revolutions have gone on continually in photography for near on 180 years and only in recent times has the previous work of photographers been cast in doubt, largely driven by marketing and the next best sensor. Now is the age when a tiny improvement costs thousands and appeals to people who want to tick the box to say they are riding the crest of the wave. Do they make better photographs, no, they make the same photograph time after time, every Summer holiday and every Christmas. That is the sink hole of new cameras unless they offer a proper step change, and that is the hole reviewers dig for their fans. I was enjoying the sharing by Jono and others here on M10R and reading all in from a 3rd party point clearly shows your rudeness!!

To sum it up: The M10-R is a M10-P that looks like a M10 with a fantastic new sensor: Higher resolution, so that You can make heavy crops easily. Higher dynamic range (nearly 1 f-stop, I would guess) for good highlights. And better colors. Noise is very good, better than with the M10: More detail, beautiful fine grain. High ISO is also slightly better than with the M10. Very good usable up to 6400 ISO; 12500 ISO is still good usable. Above that there is too much color shift and details are lost. The rangefinder is the same as in the M10/M10-M. No problems with focussing at this resolution. The camera was perfectly calibrated with my Apo-Summicron 2,0/50 mm. I had no problems focussing in practice too. And I never noticed anything negative due to the higher resolution of the sensor: Not more blur, no need for higher shutter speed to avoid blur, no problems with sharpness. AWB was a bit cooler than with the M10. No problem for me, I like it. But Leica said to us they want to make it alike the other cameras of the M-line. This was one result of our firmware betatest. General usability is as good as the M10. Same silent shutter and touchscreen, only a little bit slower in saving pictures due to the bigger data volume. But that doesn\u00b4t matter to me. Firmware stability is good, no freezing. The M10 in all it\u00b4s variants is the best usual M-camera - but: Wake up time is far too long!!!! 1,5 sec!!! And the timelag when shooting in LV mode is too long too. Does one need the higher resolution: It is an advantage, no doubt. I made a few comparisons with the the M10. You can see the difference, but it is not eye-catching, You have to look close at cropped photos. Then You see that the ones oft he M10-R are sharper and have more crisp. For many this may be a strong reason to buy this camera. For me it is more the higher dynamic range and the better color. Here are some pictures taken with the M10-R for my ongoing series about my hometown M\u00f6nchengladbach. Perhaps it is not everyones style, but don\u00b4t blame the camera for it.

However, money is not unlimited, so I still have some choices to make, which I'm hoping some of you can help with, or at least confirm that they might not be as tough as they appear. My current thinking is that I can get a good used M10 (\u00a34100) and 35mm Summilux ASPH II (\u00a32300). I'm mostly going to be using this for travel and street style, so I think that this seems like a good combination. Photography isn't my profession, or even a money-making sideline, it's just for my own enjoyment. And yes, I fully realise that there are many cheaper, newer, 'better' cameras out there. I don't want one of those. But then, the internet hinders as much as it helps. Should I spend another \u00a31000 for the M10-P? The touch screen looks nice but isn't a big issue for me, and the quieter shutter is, well, nice? I don't see hundreds of threads of people complaining about the outrageously loud shutter on the M10, so is it really worth it for me? And it will take me another few months to save the extra cash. Then there's the M10-R, obviously, but at least another \u00a33000 on top of my M10 budget. And an even longer time to save. Ideally I could add in some actual real world experiences to my decision making. However here in the UK it doesn't seem possible to hire any of these cameras so I can't try them out to see which I prefer, and I don't know anyone with one either. I find it very easy to get caught up in the details, just because there's something newer, 'better', whatever. So maybe my question is this; is the M10 still a good value introduction to the Leica world? Thoughts, ideas, and help all appreciated. Yes I think so. Anyway, for me the gateway to Leica World in the nineties has been secondhand gear and it has been for a long time after. I then even preferred an M4 above a new M6. In your case however I personally would definitely choose for the M10-P. The silence of its shutter is such a joy in actual shooting, which would be my main reason. But in theatre photography, which I like, it is an important functionality too. The built-in level gauge would help me making good vertical shots and with a 35mm, or wider later on, this is an important aid. As I get older I see that I make much more often tilted shots. The touchscreen is faster in checking focus. Your argument for the choice for the Summilux 35mm asph ii is bull\u2019s eye in my view.

Used properly, the M shutter release - as designed - is better than any add-on. What is \"used properly?\" Grip the camera with three fingers and the thumb of the right hand. Lay the index finger across the top of the camera so that that tip lies on the shutter dial, bent ~70\u00b0 at the second finger joint. That finger will then \"bridge\" the shutter button and its protective bowl or bezel. The finger is now stabilized on four points - the shutter dial, both sides of the shutter button bezel, and the edge of the camera under the second knuckle. Then simply squeeze or flex that whole finger down (as farnz says, don't \"stab\" with a fingertip). The finger flesh will settle into the bowl, firing the shutter (and tightening your grip at the same time, just when you need it). Much more stable than balancing the finger or fingertip on a raised \"pinnacle\" (i.e. add-on button). Try it. --img--  This is the most amazing thing anyone has told me about how to use my Leica M. I looked at your photo, and my first impression was that it made no sense at all. It just looked all wrong to me. Then I picked up one of my cameras and tried it. Incredible - when I applied enough pressure to that part of my finger to release the shutter, the camera remained rock still! I tried it over and over - amazing! So for 50 years I've been doing this wrong. I had to slide my index finger just a little bit further over the shutter release - still need to practice. I need to make this a habit from now on. To me, it \"looks\" wrong, and it \"feels\" wrong, but there is no doubt about it - when the shutter is released, the camera didn't move, or at least not enough that I could see it.

This thread has to be a prank, right? Resolution doesn't determine the look of an image. The whole concept of lower rez sensors looking better is daft.

Shoot raw and make them look the same in post!\" Which is a huge pile of bullsh##. I won't get into why you can't actually get a truly raw file from a consumer digital camera. Any sensor that's got a change from another one will have a different aesthetic. Up down or sideways, if you change a CFA, microlenses, AD converter you get something different. Then there's the profiles. Both manufacturers and image processor. If you don't like the M10R in Lightroom then give C1 a try. Or something else. There's so many things going on in that pipeline.

The S is though. The S3 done right is something else. Geeesus! you can even have exactly the same sensor and get different looks. Grab a Hasselblad X1D and a Fujifilm GFX 50R and put them side by side. Not even close and they have exactly the same silicon. We've got how a sensor and a lens interacts. Different flange distances. Different lens designs. Different in camera profiles, lens calibration data and raw output. Different colour science. What's actually going on is that Leica has a different colour science, bayer array and microlens design on every damn camera they make. It's like shooting Acros, TMax and Neopan side by side. Absolutely you'll prefer one to the others. But it isn't resolution. Change cameras and you change the type of *film*stock you're using. Then you've got a new microlens design that's going to work differently with different lenses. A lens you like on the M10P might not float your boat on the M10R. But a lens you didn't like on the M10P might sing. Don't think much of my MATE on my M10. But on the M10M is fantastic. My favourite combo at the moment. And finally, bias. We get to a place we understand and then we have to make changes and we don't want to. So you like the look of the M10P over the R. But how long have you spent dialling in the new camera? You have thousands of frames on the M10P. You know how it responds. You have the metering dialled in. You choose lenses based on what you like. Maybe all it will take is some time, learning and a Lightroom preset till you prefer the new camera. Earlier I said I liked but didn't love the M8 or 240 and loved the M9 and M10. That's because the M8 and 240 were the big changes. M8 to 9 was small. M240 to M10 was small. Didn't have to do a big shift in thinking or workflow. But when I go back and reprocess images now I vastly prefer the M240 to the M9. Whodathunkit??? Change a camera and you change much more than just the resolution.

But the number of photosites? Nope. That 'aint it. I loved the original Canon 5D sensor. Disliked the 5D2 a lot. Liked but didn't love the M8 or 240. Loved the M9 and M10. Love the M10R, as I think it's got better overall colour and needs less work with skin tones. But I use Lightroom. Someone else using C1 might see different. None are even close to the X1D, for me. The S is though. The S3 done right is something else. Geeesus! you can even have exactly the same sensor and get different looks. Grab a Hasselblad X1D and a Fujifilm GFX 50R and put them side by side. Not even close and they have exactly the same silicon. We've got how a sensor and a lens interacts. Different flange distances. Different lens designs. Different in camera profiles, lens calibration data and raw output. Different colour science. What's actually going on is that Leica has a different colour science, bayer array and microlens design on every damn camera they make. It's like shooting Acros, TMax and Neopan side by side. Absolutely you'll prefer one to the others. But it isn't resolution. Change cameras and you change the type of *film*stock you're using. Then you've got a new microlens design that's going to work differently with different lenses. A lens you like on the M10P might not float your boat on the M10R. But a lens you didn't like on the M10P might sing. Don't think much of my MATE on my M10. But on the M10M is fantastic. My favourite combo at the moment. And finally, bias. We get to a place we understand and then we have to make changes and we don't want to. So you like the look of the M10P over the R. But how long have you spent dialling in the new camera? You have thousands of frames on the M10P. You know how it responds. You have the metering dialled in. You choose lenses based on what you like. Maybe all it will take is some time, learning and a Lightroom preset till you prefer the new camera. Earlier I said I liked but didn't love the M8 or 240 and loved the M9 and M10. That's because the M8 and 240 were the big changes. M8 to 9 was small. M240 to M10 was small. Didn't have to do a big shift in thinking or workflow. But when I go back and reprocess images now I vastly prefer the M240 to the M9. Whodathunkit??? Change a camera and you change much more than just the resolution. It's overly simplistic to think resolution is the main cause of an aesthetic change between cameras. Gordon Great great post. I think I agree with EVERYTHING you said.

This is time, instead of using my Sumilux 35 ASPH pre FLE, I decided to go with the Nokton 35 1.4 MC vII. I chose this lens because it has a more vintage classic look, IMO, and I wanted to see if we could lose that character with a very modern camera like the Sony if it would render as nicely. All photos where shot in raw, about 20 secs apart from each other. They are not always exactly the same cause I did it handheld. I wish I had more people, and in general more interesting stuff but France just got under lock down again so I had to do it all at home. My kids and my dog move too fast for lens change, and my wife has stopped accepting to be the subject of these camera tests long ago. The photos are all very very boring, but the point of this test was just to compare the cameras in different scenarios. A note on shooting with both camera: On the M10P , it was actually easier to focus with the RF than with the Focus peaking on the Sony, even if the Sony is nice. The metering on the A7SIII outperforms the M10P almost every time, even though I used the M10P in live mode to avoid spot metering. I did the blind test to myself, and to be honest I could not always guess which camera was which. But almost every time I shocked myself and preferred the Sony to the Leica. Of course, shooting wise, the Sony was still disgusting, and the Leica was a total pleasure. But what I remember from this is that 12MP vs 24MP produces no aesthetics difference (since this is what this thread is about). Besides that, of course I prefer my Leica, but if one day I go out to shoot video with my Sony, I know that I could bring my 35 mil with me and still get photos as well. Let me know if you have any interrogation on the way I took the photos, settings, etc.... Now my question to you is not which camera is Sony and which is Leica, but which one did you prefer ? https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31?usp=sharing Hey @Steven thanks for spending time and putting this togetheir I have gone through the images and here are my thoughts. Image #1: B -Rationale: I prefer softer transition look towards the right corner Image #2: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal. Besides the warmer colours from the top LHS, I am assuming the sun position had changed. Image #3: A -Rationale: I preferred the \u201chue\u201d of the green grass behind the soft toy Image #4: B -Rationale: I really didn\u2019t like image A corners. it looked like it had shade of \u201cpink\u201d Image #5: A -Rationale: Although I didn\u2019t like the colours on the corners, I actually preferred the highlights \u201cclipping\u201d in this image. Image B is technically better (highlights don\u2019t look clipped\u2026 has a more gently roll off) but my preference is still A Image #6: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #7: B -Rationale: I prefer the colours from the ocean \u2013 Sky compared to A -Additional Notes: Looking at the grass I can see what sections of the frame is in focus, so I won\u2019t focus on the dog and ball. Image #8: N/A -Rationale: I had a slight preference to A due to the skin tones, but it\u2019s difficult for me to make an assessment here, as the focus is slightly different. -Additional Notes: note that the image on A is focused on the eye, whilst B is slightly off Image #9: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #10: B -Rationale: The tiles had more detail on B than A (Corners) Image #11: B -Rationale: I prefer the warmer look in (B) than the colder look in (A) Image #12: B -Rationale: Prefer how the tree looks (shadow) compared to A. Additionally I like how the wall on the RHS look the \u201ccooler\u201d colour cast looks better compared to the slightly warmer tones. Image #13: A -Rationale: I prefer the warmer colours here (green, sky) Image #14: A -Rationale: I prefer the warmer colours here -Additional Notes: focus is slightly different (refer to the tap) Image #15: B -Rationale: Prefer the light on the grass in this scene, very close though. Image #16: N/A -Rationale: I preferred A but as the focus here is slightly different it\u2019s an \u201cN/A\u201d -Additional Notes: Focus is slightly different here Image #18: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal Image #19: B -Rationale: Prefer the colour of the timber here Image #20: N/A -Rationale: Felt they were both equal -Additional Notes: Focus is slightly different here Image #21: A -Rationale: Prefer the colour of the sky here, the other image is too cold Image #22: A -Rationale: Prefer the white couch here -Additional Notes: Focus is slightly different here Image #23: A -Rationale: Prefer the colours in the sky here Image #24:B -Rationale: The green on the plant looked weird in A My Conclusion/Self-reflection: I kind of expected these kinds of results, I have tried something similar with my camera gear in the past.

Not the point of any of my posts. I posted that first grouping as a reaction to several comments complaining that M10-R files are flat. Hence a selection of high contrast poppy sort of shots. Not what you're looking for. Check. But thinking a few photos from a singular photographer represent what the M10-R is all about is not giving Leica much credit, methinks. Having shot with the M10 for 3.5 years, I see the 10-R as a more flexible tool, particularly for color work. AFAIC, there is a set of lenses that have never, ever looked better, far smoother in transition to OoF areas, for example. With no reasonable T/S solution for the M, I place value on the increased ability to crop vertically, yet still be able to print with nearly the same number of pixels as if I had clambered up a ladder with the original. There are a host of other reasons some, no doubt, as yet undiscovered. AFAIC, I've yet to encounter anything the M10 could do, the 10-R can not. This isn't to say their aren't noticeable differences SooC. There are. It's a matter of recalibrating how you go about treating the files to drag out what you happen to want. This remains an ongoing process for me at the moment. My tendency so far has been to try to explore and exploit the new capabilities, rather than the familiar ones. After 6 or 7 years of 24Mpx Leicas, I am (and I suspect others as well) looking for a different look. Over time perhaps some will re-embrace the more classical look, older glass will return into the rotation and as it does, you may begin to see work that alters your view a bit. But, as thats not what I'm interested in the moment, I have very little in the portfolio to convince you one way or the other. But let's quickly try. This time two images taken roughly two years and 100 miles apart. Chosen for no particular reason other than they share a similar motif coupled with the fact that my current catalog of B&W photos done with the R is limited at present. One with the 50mm 'lux, the other the 35mm Distagon. One with the M10, one with the M10R. Forget about whether or not you find the resultant style compelling, not the point. The point is that if I so desire I can make the same sort of photos from a tonality standpoint with the R as I did with the previous version. Yet again the resampling and downsizing does a measure of injustice to the originals in either case, but hopefully the pair convey some sense that these cameras are indeed siblings. The younger one, should you so choose to take advantage, being capable of a bit more 'tude. But if she oversteps, you can still send her straight to her room to contemplate the indiscretion. --img--  --img--  Where I value having the added flexibility of the 10R, you might find no need for it. That, however, is an entirely different discussion. If you hate detail and are constantly having to tamp it down, the case for the R, or any higher resolution camera, certainly takes a hit. But as always, the power to use or abuse rests within the mind of the photographer. I recall my initial reaction to all the early M10M/50APO shots was wow, astonishing, not even remotely for me. Then I saw a few efforts elsewhere, using different glass and post treatments and decided that if I ever sell my beloved race car, I'm gonna get me one of 'em. Perhaps, if examined dispassionately, you might find as I did with the M10M that there are a few subtle aspects buried in one or two of the very limited set of samples available that might be relevant to what you want to achieve.

Usually with software the randomness of the original is lost as a fixed systematic program is applied to the pixels. But maybe it satisfies? At this point I vacillate. Like you I am considering M10-R, but I only own M9 and M8.2 so have no M10 to compare, and no camera store within even 3 hours drive to test a new Leica body. And I add Z6 Nikon that has all things maybe but same problem of a Z7 with much higher resolution to confuse the choice. Love that line of yours\u2026 \"Marry the camera lens\u2026 date the camera body\". I don't know man... I'm frustrated at this point. I want so badly to buy the M10R. I like having the latest thing. I like flexibility. I like the red dot design ! I really want to love it. The extra MP would be useful for me because as you can see on my instagram I do a lot of landscape, and compositing as well so sometimes I take one small piece of a photo and put it in another, so detail matters. But I also use my M a lot on \"people\", and for people I think I just don't like it as much as my M10P, regardless of the lens. I just downloaded all the photos from DP review and Matt and played with them all night. On the positive side, I need to say that I am pleasantly surprised. I could never manage to edit and like my R5 or my A7RIV photos. Never. I always blamed it on the MP. But I always loved my Q2 high res clinical images. And here again with the M10R files, the images are very beautiful. But on the negative side, they are just too clean, too modern, too detailed too perfect. I am sorry, but this has proven to me 100% that 40MP has a different aesthetics, and no matter what I did, I could not make them look \"atmospheric\" in LR... It's frustrating because at this point I believe that for street and landscape, the M10R is clearly superior, but for people and portraits, in my taste, the M10P is more advantageous. I just couldn't make them match perfectly. I think that if you plan to upgrade from an M9, spending the premium on the M10R is logical. It's a much better camera and the advantages you get out of it are very worth it I think. But for us with the M10, the upgrade is more difficult to justify.

Yes, the camera was sent to Wetzlar and as you described, it is extremely frustrating and annoying as M10 is the most unstable digital camera I own. I owned my first DC since 1998 and even the cheapest one was much more stable than M10. I have a friend who own an M10 and he also have bad experience such as needed to remove battery to fix a freeze. I have to say again I don't expect M10 is perfect, but I expect it can be repaired and I also expect the customer service can be better. I even asked them to bear the cost of shipping for this time but they refused. What makes me really upset is the screen protector was scratched after repairing. If I am the technician who made the scratch, I must replace for a new one for the customer rather than pretends nothing happened. This is the basic norm of a responsible after service department, right? But the Leica customer service didn't even reply \"I am sorry that your protector is scratched because......\" after I made the complaint. They perfer to remain silence. If the Leica service could not even do right in such minor aspect, how can I trust the whole repairing service and customer department? I have already send quite a lot of long emails to reflect the problems but what I can get is \"resend the camera for inspection\". They don't promise anything or try to do something.

I had in the past the first version of the X100, and I loved it. It was not my top, but they say X100v is so much better than the previous version. Or cameras such as XT-4 ... I heard great things about it. And I also see many people using the Sony FF mirrorless. The IQ, large quantity of third parts lens/accessories, it's very customizable. For the people here having M system and mirrorless cameras (but not Leica L-mount), which brand do you use/prefer? Panasonic, Fuji, or Sony? I never considered Fuji because the lack of FF cameras under $2.5k I have used and still own several systems from m4/3rd Oly EM5, APSC Fuji XT2 & X100. I have always been intrigued by Leica. I recently tried M10 and was quite smitten by it but still rather apprehensive being manual rangefinder. I don\u2019t think I could make justice to that $$$ with my photography. I got Q2 instead for many reasons: size, fix lens 28mm 1.7 Lux, macro mode, FF, AF and still give me the taste of Leica. I think this is enough to give my photography a \u2018spark\u2019 for now. Maybe will own an M one day....maybe... I will be selling my m4/3rd - love their lenses, excellent quality and small sizes but their sensor is kinda outdated. Will be keeping my fuji as I just love using it. Love it\u2019s colour and film simulation, never have issue with APSC. Just sold my X100F and upgraded to X100V just for the lens upgrade & flip LCD.

I could use my Nikon Z setup but I prefer the size of the Leica gear. But every time I go away I struggle with the M240. I\u2019m not quick to focus with it. The preview images are seriously bad and you can\u2019t really check the focus on them. I often wish I could disable the screen so I don\u2019t have the temptation to check it and annoy me. I just don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having fun. So yesterday I put the M240 away and just stuck to the Q and had fun. Maybe I\u2019m fighting between two ways of working? I often think I should put the Q away for a while and focus on the M240 but it seems nuts to shelf a \u00a33000 camera when it\u2019s *such* a good camera. Before I had the Q I had a Fuji X100s and loved it to bits. One camera. One focal length. It made me feel like I was Joel Meyerowitz on the streets of New York. Silly but such fun. The Q is my most used camera for this decade. The M240 was bought with some money my dad left me so I feel obligated to enjoy it but it\u2019s been 2 years now and I\u2019m not sure I am. How do I enjoy it more? I\u2019m travelling now in the Netherlands and would love to have some fun with it. @petecarr, Focusing with an M camera takes some practice. Speed and accuracy of focus will come with time; it's all about time with your eye glued to the eyepiece of the camera. The more hours you spend that way, the more hours you hone your focusing technique, the sooner focusing proficiency will start to appear. Some M users will say this is an abomination, but you might think about stopping down your lens from wide open one or two f/stops while perfecting your technique; this will give you a bit of room for error and will help avoid shots where focus is missed. Be mindful to not use this technique long term, as it will then become a crutch and hold you back from maximizing your low light shooting and the shallow depth of field that your M lenses have to offer. Yes, the rear screens of the M240 cameras are not that great for determining critical focus, depending on which lens you are using. With my 90 Summicron, I had to make myself quit looking at the rear screen to try to determine if I had nailed focus. The images on the rear screen of my M-P 240 always look terrible with that lens. I had to learn to focus with relentless attention and ignore the rear screen. My 90 Summicron shots come out well focused probably 90% or more of the time; what I had to learn was to stop second guessing my focus based on what the rear screen was showing me. While you are traveling in the Netherlands, think about shooting with your M240 75% of the time so you can get better with focusing it and shoot with your Q 25% of the time just for fun or when you need autofocus and/or the higher ISO range the Q has to offer. Don't give up on your M240 and manual focus - it will come with time and practice. If you persevere, in time quicker, accurate focusing will become second nature. These are just my thoughts, based on my own experience. Good luck and keep us posted! Edit Given that you have been struggling with focusing your M240 for two years, I am wondering if your rangefinder mechanism is out of calibration. I would consider that as a possible reason for your focusing issues. If none of the above helps, talk to your Leica dealer in the UK and ask them to take a look at your M240 to evaluate it and make a recommendation.

Here is the thing, everybody takes longer to focus when the DOF is shallow, and it is harder to check focus in the LCD. So saying you aren't fast enough and it's impossible to check focus is trying to set yourself apart rather than doing what everybody does, and has done from the days of film, use workarounds. This is what I was hoping for. Some tips on what normal people do with the camera because I feel like I've got a good understanding and if I'm doing everything right and still not enjoying it then maybe its not for me. 3 hours ago, 250swb said: The first thing to do is ask yourself why all good photojournalists who use Leica's tend to stick with the 'f/8 and be there' motto, it works because you use DOF to get everything important in focus and focusing is faster because you know you have some latitude with DOF to play with. So for fast moving events use f/8, or f/11, or f/16 because with the M240 you have another workaround, set the ISO to 'Auto' and let it take care of itself setting the minimum shutter speed limit so you don't get camera shake or subject movement. Thanks. But yeah it seems I'm doing some things right. I do walk around with it set to f8. I have years of experience using my big Nikon D800/700 on M without auto-iso because I want to be in control. I use f/1.x for creative reasons because sometimes I like subject isolation. Maybe for the simplest of reasons to photograph my wife while we're sat in a cafe. 3 hours ago, 250swb said: It's probably also worth considering fast lenses with shallow DOF were a requirement for low light, and when used focus bracketing the shot was, and is, a good idea. Now that people think shallow DOF is 'artistic' and is used for it's own sake focusing is never going to be fast, so develop a habit, perhaps in this order focus on the subject, then a fraction behind, then a fraction in front, each bracket will hopefully cover your own or the subjects movement between focusing and pressing the shutter. Do it the same each time and in your editing your shots you'll know which was supposed to be sharp, then see if either of the other two are sharper. Thanks. That's something I never considered.

Yeah I may have to try and accept that I don't have the experience for f/1.4 just yet and use f/2 or f/2.8. Just a bit annoying with the ISO limitations on the 240. I'm used to ISO 6400 on my work cameras. Even my old Nikon D700 was \"ok\" at that and it's 11 years old. So it's a little hard limiting myself to 3200. The other night we were out around The Hague and it was foggy. I tried with the M240 and I really had to push it to get results. I almost wish I'd bought a M10 instead. I nearly did but decided the \u00a34000 difference for a bit better ISO was crazy.

My wife\u2019s mother, Joan, was dying and it fell to us to be her 24/7 caregivers, with some help from other family members, because we both had careers in healthcare.

This mirrors my own experience using a red filter on different Ms (M8.2; M9-P; M9M; M-D Typ 262) but not with other colours of filter. The first couple of times I used a red filter I thought I had focussed poorly so tried again taking extreme care. No difference.

No difference but I'm still not ruling this idea out...

The compiler's findings would imply that best performance is at ISO 160 (if max Dynamic Range also equals optimum performance/results) which is different to the conclusions of Sean Reid in Reid Reviews. Always interesting. However, we need to remember that dynamic range is a general principle covering all kinds of analog devices and their signals, not just cameras. (Note that a \"digital\" sensor itself is an analog device - the sensor outputs electrons/charge/voltage/signal in amounts or levels analogous to the photons that are input. It ain't digital (1s and 0s) until that analog output runs through a separate chip; the analog/digital converter.) An orchestra has a dynamic range - the faintest music it can produce playing ppp (very very softly) to the loudest music it can produce playing fff (very very loudly). A recording of that orchestra will have its own dynamic range, depending on the capabilites of the microphones and recording medium (wax disc, magnetic tape). And a playback of that recording will have yet another dynamic range, based on where the playback system introduces distortion (\"rumble\" or \"fuzz\" in loud sounds), and a \"noise floor\" (clicks, pops, tape hiss in the soft sounds). (If you go to a concert, and in the pianissimo parts, you can hear the coughs and feet-shuffling of the audience, or the creaking of the seats, that is also a \"noise floor.\" The music can't be heard \"pure\" and \"correctly\" at that low volume.) The analogies (hah!) in photography are blown or miscolored highlights (distortion), and shadow noise (noise floor). And the rated or tested dynamic range will (or should) exclude those sounds or brightnesses (recognizable, even if \"damaged\") that contain distortion and/or noise beyond a very limited amount (Typically, 1-3% of the total signal/sound/brightness range). When I made a shirt-cuff test of the color M10 at ISO 100 and 200 (as mentioned by Uliwer, but a different thread than the saturation one), I noted that at 200 the distortion was lower (better protection of highlights). But I also noted that at ISO 200 the noise floor was higher (the same shadows adjusted to the same brightness were noisier). I would imagine that someone doing a rigorous DR measurement (DxO or photonstophotos) is going to measure both ends of the scale, and subtract range that shows additional noise in excess of some very low limit as \"not really counting\". Thus in, for example, the color M10, the loss in the highlights at ISO 100 is outweighed by the lower noise in the shadows, for a net higher dynamic range than ISO 200, when graphed. We as photographers are usually most concerned with blown highlights as a measure of DR. But that's really only half the story. ___________________ Of note: LCD screens have a DR of about 10 stops, and glossy print paper has a DR of about 7 stops. Therefore we will never actually be able to see a full DR of 11 stops or higher on our screens or in a print - without manipulations. We can fiddle with the screen brightness or print brightness to see one end or the other better - but not both ends at once. But the higher DR does allow more headroom or footroom for manipulations.

I wrote also that I prefer the greater flexibility of digital filters from post-processing to glass contrast filters. Indeed, I previously had the M-Monochrom and prefer the M10 in this respect. Some background Having published my book last November, I'm now thinking about another project. I've been posting a series of images in a (tentative) series called Empire of Signs, the title of Roland Barthes' book about Japan. I don't believe in jumping directly into defining a new project: rather i tend to take pictures and see how this leads me to a project; so, Empire of Signs may not lead anywhere. When I was in Tokyo at the end of November, I bought a new, 2019 edition of Moriyama Daido's Light and Shadow, which was published in 1982. The latter first edition came out ten years after his previous book and three years after he stopped photographing altogether. As I recall, he got back to photographing after looking at the first photograph ever made, the one by Ni\u00e9pce, which was an eight hour exposure of the view out of a window: it had a building and showed just light and shadow. Moriyama's book established a narrative between light and shadow. Some of the pictures in Light and Shadow are things at the verge: scruffy plants, for examine, at the edge of a store. Photographing in Thailand, often in the harsh, midday sun, I've been thinking about this type of image, and how it could be worked into the Empire of Signs.Today, I made the picture below.

I could have done this with a Monochrom camera, but the adjusting the M10 colors gives me more control. On the other hand, with the M10M, I might be able to show more detail in the leaves, which could also be interesting Perhaps a better example is the image below, shot in dappled sunlight. I've posted a couple of images of these three tourists taking a group selfie of themselves using an iPhone on a tripod stick. Here, I was speaking to them, saying I was taking unposed pictures when I got a thumbs up, a V-sign, and the flashing of my name card.

After reading your post and looking at your pictures, though, I feel I could tell that the second one was produced by adjusting the LR colour sliders, and was not 'natural'. Whether I could make the same judgement in a blind test is another matter. Some years ago I photographed competitive Latin dancers in the Winter Gardens, Blackpool, using the SL. The lighting was very difficult: pink and green spots, and not that bright, and I was trying to deal with movement as well.

I should consider myself a breaking even- the cost to have the car serviced was about the same as sending the camera to have the bad line remapped. And- servicing the car only took a few hours, sending the Camera away would be weeks. I modified my program to read the bad column(s) in from a file, and made adding the Gamma curve optional. I also found images where the bad column had \"hot\" pixels, good pixels, and \"Cold\" pixels. Which just meant taking \"Absolute values\" for the threshold test when deciding to correct a pixel or not. ANYWAY: when looking at the \"bad\" column on my camera, the structure is retained- just the level is above or below the neighbors. Rather than just average over the column all the time, my code computes a local offset and applies it when the levels of the bad column is too far above or below the two neighbors. A running average of 5 pixels is used to compute the local offset. The code at present generates a new file, leaves the original intact. It works with DNG files from the M Monochrom, and will not work with those emitted by Photoshop. Turns out that saved DNG files are different from what the camera generates. The same code will optionally add a Gamma curve, it asks for \"curve\" when starting up. a \"0\"- Gamma is skipped and a new file is generated starting with a \"C\" (Corrected). Give a curve from 1-8, get a file starting with \"G\" (Gamma). The program either works on one file at a time, or processes all the files in a directory. Runs on XP through to WIN10. Also runs on PharLap extended DOS, but different compiler options for that. This is a Windows console program. I did try an algorithm to identify the bad columns automatically. One of the test images: Fabric in a Hat lines up perfectly with the Columns of the image. Broke the algorithm. SO- back to determining bad columns using Photoshop to get the number, and just have the list read in at runtime. If anyone has a M Monochrom with a similar problem, I could look at a DNG file and see if this code corrects the problem. I can make up the file with the bad locations (trivial) and send the code to try out.

Maybe even not as good as the M246 thread. I agree. I much prefer the M9M thread over the M10M thread, but I don't think that has anything to do with the cameras. The M10M thread started in January of this year, 9 months ago, and has 90 pages so far. The M246 thread started 65 months ago (5+ yrs) and has 79 pages. The Monochrom Type 1 thread started 96 months ago (8 yrs) and has 161 pages. So the M10M thread has over half the number of posts in one tenth the amount of time as the M9M thread. I don't know how many owners of each camera exist, but clearly people are posting a lot more on the M10M thread. Looks like a similar number of posters to each thread. I doubt if the camera made us 10X better photographers, so the natural conclusion is that a higher percentage of mediocre images are being posted on the M10M thread than on the other two. To my eye, many of the images on the M9M thread have real artistic intent, while many of the images on the M10M thread are family snapshots or pictures from the day's walk. That's fine, but different. Not making a value judgement. The M10M image thread kind of reminds me of the SL image thread. Maybe it points to the intentions of M10M vs. M9M photographers who are members of this forum who like to post. Maybe the M9M is the starving artist's tool whereas the M10M is the rich retiree's tool. I don't know.

Please don't go out of your way to test. As you suggest, I always do my own demo of potential new gear, shooting my own pics and making prints. I rarely do any detailed A/B testing, though....life is too short....but I do make judgments about gear once I've accumulated enough data points from real life pics and prints, not pixel peeping. Usually my gut tells me. (And IQ these days is so good from so much gear, that judgments and purchase decisions are usually more on the basis of viewing/focusing, handling and ergonomics, menus/controls, lens options, etc). With regard to the S vs the M10 Monochrom b/w output, I anticipated that you might have some gut reaction, particularly with respect to tonality and tonal transitions, perhaps resulting from the bigger S sensor. Others often comment about the 'feel' of S pics vs those from 'full frame' high MP cameras such as the SL2, with the former being more 'organic' in some way, even if not technically superior. The fact that you need to do more testing to draw some better conclusions already suggests to me that you don't have a similar immediate reaction. I'm currently happy with my M10, M Monochrom and SL2 (relatively new). I haven't tested the M10 Monochrom and probably won't any time soon. I knew you embraced the S system and enjoyed big prints (mostly from reading Mike Johnston over at TOP), so I thought I'd ask you about IQ/print rendering compared to your M10M. Thanks again.

They had managed to reduce its size to that of an M7, to speed it up, quieten the shutter and streamline the operation. Then came the M10-P with an even quieter shutter. The M10-Monochrom retains the quieter shutter of the M10-P, but adds a completely new 41mp monochrome sensor (7864 x 5200 pixels). Of course this brings up a number of immediate questions: Are the M lenses good enough to support such resolution? Does anyone really need this much black and white resolution? Is the M10 electronics sufficient to deal with such big files? Is it possible to hold the camera steady enough with no Stabilisation? Is it possible to focus accurately enough with the rangefinder I\u2019ll be looking at these questions in the course of this article. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> As usual I should emphasise that my job with Leica is as a camera tester, and my job is to report problems to Leica (which I certainly do!). On the other hand I would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical and I don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). I\u2019m not asked what to write, and although I do show them to Leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. In the past (and always by chance) it has turned out that testing cameras has coincided with one of our trips abroad. This time it hasn\u2019t been the case, what\u2019s more I\u2019ve had a pretty busy time at work, so, apart from a brief working trip to Cornwall (where it rained every day), the images accompanying this article have mostly been shot within walking distance of home (or in a local pub!). The Body The M10-Monochrom body is a beautiful thing, and I think this might just be the loveliest of all the variants (perhaps of all the digital M cameras). The body is a stealthy black chrome, with no red dot (just the big screw of the M10-P). It has no logo on the top plate, just the word MONOCHROM engraved in small letters at the front (mine also has P03/15 engraved to indicate it\u2019s prototype status). On the back it says LEICA CAMERA WETZLAR - MADE IN GERMANY, but like the engraving on the top plate this is not picked out In colour. The shutter speed dial has the shutter speeds picked out in white (as usual), but the A setting is grey rather than red, and this goes for the M setting on the ISO dial and the red dot on the on/off. The rear plate is the same as a normal M10, with LV, PLAY and MENU buttons on the left and a 4 way rocker switch on the right with a central button. The thumb wheel and it\u2019s bump are also the same as the M10. The whole effect is very discreet and really smart. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> Operation, Speed, and Menus If you put a much larger sensor into a camera with the same processor you are inevitably going to have an impact on the speed of processing, and it\u2019s certainly the case with the M10-Monochrom. Shot to shot times, writing to disk and review times are all slower. So perhaps it isn\u2019t the camera for sport! On the other hand I mostly use Sandisk Extreme Pro 64Gb 95ms SD cards, and with the camera on continuous-fast it takes 10 DNG files at high speed before pausing, and another 10 before really slowing down. I can\u2019t imagine anyone using continuous on a camera like this, but it does show that for measured shooting the slightly slower processing times are unlikely ever to cause an issue. Certainly I\u2019ve never been inconvenienced by it. On the rare occasion the camera is behind itself reading or rendering a file it shows the file number (rather than a question mark or error). If you\u2019re a fast shooter, then you should be aware of the issue, but for most normal photographers it won\u2019t ever be relevant. The important point is that as far as I\u2019m aware there is no shutter lag involved, whether you use the EVF or not. I\u2019m not going into the menu system in any detail. As expected, it is pretty much identical with the M10, but with colour and white balance options removed. Having spent much of the last year using Panasonic and Fujifilm cameras it\u2019s a real joy getting back to Leica\u2019s simple but functional menu system. I think it\u2019s sometimes overlooked how much purpose and determination Leica put into keeping it like this. Focusing and Image Stabilisation (or not) The Leica M Rangefinder (or, in German, Messsucher, hence the \u201cM\u201d) was first released in 1953, and it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to wonder whether it is still fit for purpose for a 41mp sensor 67 years later in 2020. I\u2019m not fortunate enough to own a 50 or 75 Noctilux, but I\u2019ve found rangefinder focusing with my 50 Summilux Asph and 75 APO Summicron to be easy and reliable, even wide open (I mostly shoot wide open). I have a practice game I play, which involves focusing with the rangefinder, and then checking whether it\u2019s correct in the EVF, it always reassures me what a wonderful tool a rangefinder still is. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> Which brings me back to the EVF. I know there have been a lot of complaints that it\u2019s rather old school, and I long since stopped using it with the M10 (I\u2019m pretty good at focusing with a rangefinder, and I like to see around the subject). I found that I liked using the EVF with the M10-Monochrom; partly because it was nice to see the image in black and white, but also for focusing: I think it works best with focus peaking turned off, and with auto zoom turned off (with zooming on the front button). For most images I found there was a shimmer of excitement over the area in focus, with no need to zoom in for critical focus. I particularly enjoyed using it with the 60mm Macro Elmarit R. I imagine that for those lucky enough to have a Noctilux or the 90 Summilux the EVF will be a real benefit, but I\u2019ll only use it when I want to see the end result before I take the picture. Surely the point of a Leica M camera is the rangefinder (at least that\u2019s how I see it). With respect to image stabilisation, of course, it would be nice to have it, but the very quiet shutter and the solid body seems to have made camera shake a relatively minor problem, and the fantastic high ISO together with the extra stop you get without the colour filter array means that you can use the ISO settings to preserve a high enough shutter speed. In this context I found the 1/f 1/(2f) and 1/(4f) minimum shutter speed in the Auto ISO settings particularly useful. Image Quality, Resolution and ISO I\u2019m afraid that I was dead set against Leica increasing the resolution from 24mp which seemed to me to be the perfect compromise between quality and convenience, resolution and file size, perfectly capable of a good sized print and fast processing. But I\u2019ve changed my mind; the extra price to pay in terms of processing power and storage space is really small in the face of the extra advantages in terms of image quality and crop-ability. With the SL2 and now the M10M I\u2019ve found myself shooting just with a 50 or a 35, when previously I would have used a zoom, or a 35 and a 75 (and the lens changes that implies). The Monochrome sensor in the M10-Monochrom foregoes the Bayer filter required in colour cameras. With a Bayer filter groups of 4 pixels (with Red, Green, Green, Blue filters) are processed in a batch and then separated into 4 pixels in the demosaicing process. This means that theoretically the Monochrom has 4 times the absolute resolution of a colour sensor. In actual fact the modern demosaicing routines are very good, and so the resolution bonus with a Monochrome sensor is perhaps more like 2 times. But that still left me wondering whether M lenses are up to a comparative resolution of 80mp. I thought I\u2019d test this with my idea of the Leica M Triumvirate: Leica 28mm Summilux Asph Leica 35mm Summilux Asph Leica 50mm Summilux Asph I shot my tame copper beech hedge at a nasty 10 metres at f1.4, f2, f4, f5.6 and f8 with each lens. Each of them lost a little at f1.4 and f2 in the very extreme corners (the 35 FLE was probably the best). Stop down a little and the corners are perfect, but even wide open all but the very corner of the frame is beautifully sharp. Unfortunately I don\u2019t own a Leica M246 Monochrom, but I do have my M9 Monochrom with the CCD sensor, and I thought it might be interesting to do some comparisons between the original Monochrom (from 2012) and this new version. I took pictures of our kitchen dresser in low artificial light with each camera on a tripod with ISO between 160 and 10,000 (for the M9M) and up to 100,000 (the maximum ISO on the M10M) I did 100 percent comparisons at natural resolution, and with the M10M scaled down to match the resolution of the M9M. I then made A4 prints at critical ISO values. What is immediately clear is that both cameras are actually quite usable right through the ISO range, but there has been a huge boost in image quality over the last 8 years, and the difference between the cameras in terms of noise amounted to about 2 - 3 stops. So that the M9M at 10,000 ISO was marginally better than the M10M at 100,000 ISO but not as good as the M10M at 64,000 ISO. Dynamic range is quite a different thing, you still have to be a little careful not to overexpose the highlights, but the amount of detail which is hidden away in the shadows in the new camera is nothing less than breathtaking. Conclusion --img--  But why a monochrome camera? Sure, it was exciting and interesting in 2012 when Leica brought out the first Monochrom, and arguably the resolution benefits were bigger then, when the M9 sensor was just 18Mp. These days converting from colour to black and white in post processing is much easier, it allows you to change the conversion on different colour channels and the higher resolution of modern sensors surely makes the increase of resolution of the monochrome sensor largely academic. But shooting with a black and white camera imposes a discipline on the photographer which can be really valuable: It really makes you think about the structure of the image and the composition whereas colour encourages a \u2018think about it later\u2019 ethos. And then there is Leica.

many of us the m10 was the ultimate digital expression of the leica rangefinder camera. they had managed to reduce its size to that of an m7, to speed it up, quieten the shutter and streamline the operation. then came the m10-p with an even quieter shutter. the m10-monochrom retains the quieter shutter of the m10-p, but adds a completely new 41mp monochrome sensor (7864 x 5200 pixels). of course this brings up a number of immediate questions: are the m lenses good enough to support such resolution? does anyone really need this much black and white resolution? is the m10 electronics sufficient to deal with such big files? is it possible to hold the camera steady enough with no stabilisation? is it possible to focus accurately enough with the rangefinder i\u2019ll be looking at

although i do show them to leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. in the past (and always by chance) it has turned out that testing cameras has coincided with one of our trips abroad. this time it hasn\u2019t been the case, what\u2019s more i\u2019ve had a pretty busy time at work, so, apart from a brief working trip to cornwall (where it rained every day), the images accompanying this article have mostly been shot within walking distance of home (or in a local pub!). the body the m10-monochrom body is a beautiful thing, and i think this might just be the loveliest of all the variants (perhaps of all the digital m cameras). the body is a stealthy black chrome, with no red dot (just the big screw of the m10-p). it has no logo on the top plate, just the word monochrom engraved in small letters at the front (mine also has p03/15 engraved to indicate it\u2019s prototype status). on the back it says leica camera wetzlar - made in germany, but like the engraving on the top plate this is not picked out in colour. the shutter speed dial has the shutter speeds picked out in white (as usual), but the a setting is grey rather than red, and this goes for the m setting on the iso dial and the red dot on the on/off. the rear plate is the same as a normal m10, with lv, play and menu buttons on the left and a 4 way rocker switch on the right with a central button. the thumb wheel and it\u2019s bump are also the same as the m10. the whole effect is very discreet and really smart. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> --img--

you are inevitably going to have an impact on the speed of processing, and it\u2019s certainly the case with the m10-monochrom. shot to shot times, writing to disk and review times are all slower. so perhaps it isn\u2019t the camera for sport! on the other hand i mostly use sandisk extreme pro 64gb 95ms sd cards, and with the camera on continuous-fast it takes 10 dng files at high speed before pausing, and another 10 before really slowing down. i can\u2019t imagine anyone using continuous on a camera like this, but it does show that for measured shooting the slightly slower processing times are unlikely ever to cause an issue. certainly i\u2019ve never been inconvenienced by it. on the rare occasion the camera is behind itself reading or rendering a file it shows the file number (rather than a question mark or error). if you\u2019re a fast shooter, then you should be aware of the issue, but for most normal photographers it won\u2019t ever be relevant. the important point is that as far as i\u2019m aware there is no shutter lag involved, whether you use the evf or not. i\u2019m not going into the menu system in any detail. as expected, it is pretty much identical with the m10,

for many of us the m10 was the ultimate digital expression of the leica rangefinder camera. they had managed to reduce its size to that of an m7, to speed it up, quieten the shutter and streamline the operation. then came the m10-p with an even quieter shutter. the m10-monochrom retains the quieter shutter of the m10-p, but adds a completely new 41mp monochrome sensor (7864 x 5200 pixels). of course this brings up a number of immediate questions: are the m lenses good enough to support such resolution? does anyone really need this much black and white resolution? is the m10 electronics sufficient to deal with such big files? is it possible to hold the camera steady enough with no stabilisation? is it possible to focus accurately enough with the rangefinder i\u2019ll be looking at these questions in the course of this article. --img--  --img--  --img--  as usual i should emphasise that my job with leica is as a camera tester, and my job is to report problems to leica (which i certainly do!). on the other hand i would never miss out anything which seemed to me to be critical and i don\u2019t get paid for writing these articles (either directly or indirectly). i\u2019m not asked what to write, and although i do show them to leica first for fact checking that is all that they do. in the past (and always by chance) it has turned out that testing cameras has coincided with one of our trips abroad. this time it hasn\u2019t been the case, what\u2019s more i\u2019ve had a pretty busy time at work, so, apart from a brief working trip to cornwall (where it rained every day), the images accompanying this article have mostly been shot within walking distance of home (or in a local pub!). the body the m10-monochrom body is a beautiful thing, and i think this might just be the loveliest of all the variants (perhaps of all the digital m cameras). the body is a stealthy black chrome, with no red dot (just the big screw of the m10-p). it has no logo on the top plate, just the word monochrom engraved in small letters at the front (mine also has p03/15 engraved to indicate it\u2019s prototype status). on the back it says leica camera wetzlar - made in germany, but like the engraving on the top plate this is not picked out in colour. the shutter speed dial has the shutter speeds picked out in white (as usual), but the a setting is grey rather than red, and this goes for the m setting on the iso dial and the red dot on the on/off. the rear plate is the same as a normal m10, with lv, play and menu buttons on the left and a 4 way rocker switch on the right with a central button. the thumb wheel and it\u2019s bump are also the same as the m10. the whole effect is very discreet and really smart. --img--  --img--  --img--  operation, speed, and menus if you put a much larger sensor into a camera with the same processor you are inevitably going to have an impact on the speed of processing, and it\u2019s certainly the case with the m10-monochrom. shot to shot times, writing to disk and review times are all slower. so perhaps it isn\u2019t the camera for sport! on the other hand i mostly use sandisk extreme pro 64gb 95ms sd cards, and with the camera on continuous-fast it takes 10 dng files at high speed before pausing, and another 10 before really slowing down. i can\u2019t imagine anyone using continuous on a camera like this, but it does show that for measured shooting the slightly slower processing times are unlikely ever to cause an issue. certainly i\u2019ve never been inconvenienced by it. on the rare occasion the camera is behind itself reading or rendering a file it shows the file number (rather than a question mark or error). if you\u2019re a fast shooter, then you should be aware of the issue, but for most normal photographers it won\u2019t ever be relevant. the important point is that as far as i\u2019m aware there is no shutter lag involved, whether you use the evf or not. i\u2019m not going into the menu system in any detail. as expected, it is pretty much identical with the m10, but with colour and white balance options removed. having spent much of the last year using panasonic and fujifilm cameras it\u2019s a real joy getting back to leica\u2019s simple but functional menu system. i think it\u2019s sometimes overlooked how much purpose and determination leica put into keeping it like this. focusing and image stabilisation (or not) the leica m rangefinder (or, in german, messsucher, hence the \u201cm\u201d) was first released in 1953, and it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to wonder whether it is still fit for purpose for a 41mp sensor 67 years later in 2020. i\u2019m not fortunate enough to own a 50 or 75 noctilux, but i\u2019ve found rangefinder focusing with my 50 summilux asph and 75 apo summicron to be easy and reliable, even wide open (i mostly shoot wide open). i have a practice game i play, which involves focusing with the rangefinder, and then checking whether it\u2019s correct in the evf, it always reassures me what a wonderful tool a rangefinder still is. --img--  --img--  --img--  which brings me back to the evf. i know there have been a lot of complaints that it\u2019s rather old school, and i long since stopped using it with the m10 (i\u2019m pretty good at focusing with a rangefinder, and i like to see around the subject). i found that i liked using the evf with the m10-monochrom; partly because it was nice to see the image in black and white, but also for focusing: i think it works best with focus peaking turned off, and with auto zoom turned off (with zooming on the front button). for most images i found there was a shimmer of excitement over the area in focus, with no need to zoom in for critical focus. i particularly enjoyed using it with the 60mm macro elmarit r. i imagine that for those lucky enough to have a noctilux or the 90 summilux the evf will be a real benefit, but i\u2019ll only use it when i want to see the end result before i take the picture. surely the point of a leica m camera is the rangefinder (at least that\u2019s how i see it). with respect to image stabilisation, of course, it would be nice to have it, but the very quiet shutter and the solid body seems to have made camera shake a relatively minor problem, and the fantastic high iso together with the extra stop you get without the colour filter array means that you can use the iso settings to preserve a high enough shutter speed. in this context i found the 1/f 1/(2f) and 1/(4f) minimum shutter speed in the auto iso settings particularly useful. image quality, resolution and iso i\u2019m afraid that i was dead set against leica increasing the resolution from 24mp which seemed to me to be the perfect compromise between quality and convenience, resolution and file size, perfectly capable of a good sized print and fast processing. but i\u2019ve changed my mind; the extra price to pay in terms of processing power and storage space is really small in the face of the extra advantages in terms of image quality and crop-ability. with the sl2 and now the m10m i\u2019ve found myself shooting just with a 50 or a 35, when previously i would have used a zoom, or a 35 and a 75 (and the lens changes that implies). the monochrome sensor in the m10-monochrom foregoes the bayer filter required in colour cameras. with a bayer filter groups of 4 pixels (with red, green, green, blue filters) are processed in a batch and then separated into 4 pixels in the demosaicing process. this means that theoretically the monochrom has 4 times the absolute resolution of a colour sensor. in actual fact the modern demosaicing routines are very good, and so the resolution bonus with a monochrome sensor is perhaps more like 2 times. but that still left me wondering whether m lenses are up to a comparative resolution of 80mp. i thought i\u2019d test this with my idea of the leica m triumvirate: leica 28mm summilux asph leica 35mm summilux asph leica 50mm summilux asph i shot my tame copper beech hedge at a nasty 10 metres at f1.4, f2, f4, f5.6 and f8 with each lens. each of them lost a little at f1.4 and f2 in the very extreme corners (the 35 fle was probably the best). stop down a little and the corners are perfect, but even wide open all but the very corner of the frame is beautifully sharp. unfortunately i don\u2019t own a leica m246 monochrom, but i do have my m9 monochrom with the ccd sensor, and i thought it might be interesting to do some comparisons between the original monochrom (from 2012) and this new version. i took pictures of our kitchen dresser in low artificial light with each camera on a tripod with iso between 160 and 10,000 (for the m9m) and up to 100,000 (the maximum iso on the m10m) -----> i !!!  did 100 percent comparisons at natural resolution, and with the m10m scaled down to match the resolution of the m9m. -----> i !!!  -----> then !!!  -----> made !!!  a4 prints at critical iso values. what is immediately clear is that both cameras are actually quite usable right through the iso range, but there has been a huge boost in image quality over the last 8 years, and the difference between the cameras in terms of noise amounted to about 2 - 3 stops. so that the m9m at 10,000 iso was marginally better than the m10m at 100,000 iso but not as good as the m10m at 64,000 iso. dynamic range is quite a different thing, you still have to be a little careful not to overexpose the highlights, but the amount of detail which is hidden away in the shadows in the new camera is nothing less than breathtaking. conclusion --img-- the easy part is to say that this camera is a joy to shoot with, a joy to handle, and produces wonderful images quite suitable to make very very big prints. the only possible functional criticism which i can find is that it\u2019s a little slow processing images and writing them to disk (sd card). but why a monochrome camera? sure, it was exciting and interesting in 2012 when leica brought out the first monochrom, and arguably the resolution benefits were bigger then, when the m9 sensor was just 18mp. these days converting from colour to black and white in post processing is much easier, it allows you to change the conversion on different colour channels and the higher resolution of modern sensors surely makes the increase of resolution of the monochrome sensor largely academic. but shooting with a black and white camera imposes a discipline on the photographer which can be really valuable: it really makes you think about the structure of the image and the composition whereas colour encourages a \u2018think about it later\u2019 ethos. and then there is leica. whilst other manufacturer\u2019s chase each others technological tails and moan about falling camera sales leica have the courage to produce excitingly different cameras, free of the function fetish of their competitors and still brave enough to produce something which really is exciting. i\u2019m absolutely convinced by this camera and it\u2019s been a real pleasure to have it and shoot with it for the last 4 months. great report! i was hoping to find out also how old lens work? the mm1 and old lens is such a great combo and to my eyes it\u2019s the camera where vintage lens look the best. given i only have lens from the 1950s it would be great to know if the m10m would be a good option for people like me:) thank you!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 25406, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "Jeff S", "date": "2020-01-23 13:57:00",

I, too, have used all three monochrom's. First, let's make an assumption that the M246 and the M10M are equivalent in image rendition (I believe the M10M is better, but bear with me). If they are equal, and the M10M provides a significantly higher pixel count for the same area, then you have your answer. The M10M has to be better to get equivalent images with smaller sized pixels, or light gathering capabilities. I'm not trying to justify upgrading from one to the other, I'm just answering the question. Second, the first point is more like philosophy than actual use. I will say that it took me about 6 months to a year to really fine tune my ability to get the most out of the camera. I've been shooting black and white film since the late 70's early 80's and developing it myself. I am far better at developing film today than I was then. I think my artistic ability has also gotten better. I'm saying, it just takes me time to get the most out of the monochrom. Third, there is visible difference in the higher ISO's and the ability to pull out shadows in the lower ISO's. I posted some images I took at ISO 50,000 and then printed at 17x22. In terms of tonality and 'noise' or 'grain', I would hang that print beside my S007 prints. I know you want DNG files to compare, but honestly, because of the pixel difference, comparing the DNG is difficult. The key to the monochrom has always been \"how much shadow detail is available, without blowing the highlights, and at minimal noise.\" The pure difference in time and technology of the CMOS chip is lower read noise, and hence, lower noise in the shadows. Everything else is the photographer's ability to determine the best exposure for the brightness of the scene and the end use of the image - small JPEG, large print for example - the camera is not in control of any of that. So IMHO, the only way to compare the monochrom's is to use a grey scale card that has 24-36 white, grey and black patches, meter for the middle grey and compare the resulting DNG files for how many stops the shadows can be increased without causing visible noise. You already know the answer, the lowest ability for shadows is the M9M, then M246 and the best is M10M. Just my opinions from use of course...

You probably have more in common than you think. I think you and JAPV are completely missing the point and not being particularly helpful and/or just being argumentative? Sorry, I think you misunderstood me. The OP was trying to gather opinions on which camera is \"better,\" M246 or M10M. Clearly, the technical specifications of the M10M are improved over M246, so for a lot of people that would make the M10M a \"better\" camera, but I don't think that's what he meant. What I responded to, which is what I think JAAPV meant, was what qualities of a camera allow you to make a better picture, because that probably is the point of getting a better camera. I think one of the greatest photographs of all time is Henri Cartier-Bresson's Derri\u00e8re la Gare St. Lazare, but it is unsharp and lacks shadow detail. It would fail as a good photograph for anyone measuring by those parameters. So, other than the technical specifications, which anyone can look up, \"better\" is highly subjective. Hence, to answer the question, as JAAPV said, \"Start by defining 'superior' in a photographic sense.\" I love the M10M, which for me is \"better\" than the M246 mostly because of the ergonomics and features. I don't care about the increased mp count (would rather it had stayed 24, frankly). But I don't think the M10M allows me to make better pictures that the M246 or any other camera. I think the OP has subsequently answered his own question because I believe I read somewhere that he ordered or has taken delivery on a M10M.

Placed an order for the M10M about a year before it was announced, then read @jonoslack article on refurbished M9's. There was no news about the release date of the M10M at that time so I ordered a refurb M9M - that was July last year. It eventually arrived in October - lovely camera, absolutely mint condition, dark red leather, silver body, and only 114 shutter actuations. The M10M was announced only a few weeks later (!) and I could not afford both. Very reluctantly decided to sell the M9M, fortunately without financial loss, and the money went towards the M10M. Both cameras produce wonderful results, although the M10M is better, at least to my eyes, and its ability to recover shadow detail (see my posy #2) is nothing short of amazing. The form factor has also evolved over 10 years. I am fortunate in that I already had the 50mm APO purchased back in 2014 and Leica glass doesn't date.

If you were to decide to expose that same scene in order to keep the highlight \"manageable\", I doubt the lowlights would be as good as they are in the DNG. Meaning you'd have to shift down the entire exposure. I think, I agree. But it's not a big deal. Yes, you have to shift down the entire exposure, set EV to -2/3 in order to protect highlights. You have to do this with the M10 IMO, too. Not so much with the M 246 nor the SL2. And it's not a big deal because the 'push-ability' (adjustment latitude) of these M10M files for shadows is amazing. The lowlights can't be pushed this hard with the M 246 nor the SL2 except at base ISO. I'm totally guessing here but I suspect that the S3 and the cut-down M10M/R sensors are BSI, likely manufactured by TowerJazz. I have only seen high megapixel ISO 3200 files that can be pushed this hard and still be so clean (with NR +20 in LR) with Sony cameras. I do have to check with the M10 though which is likely not a BSI sensor. I took a number of test shots yesterday with the M10M and the M 246 side by side in low-light, high contrast scenes but used different lenses stopped down as I didn't want to switch lenses all the time. Below here are a couple of them with the M10M first with links to DNG downloads. BTW, I really have trouble with the uploaded picture size on this forum now. For some reason I can't write the settings underneath a picture anymore without ISO appearing on the right side.

With the S prices, bodies and lenses so reasonable I am tempted to fill in the lens focal lengths I don't own, the 100mm would be nice but rare on the secondary market. Several years ago I did see comparisons of the M9M, M240 and S006 B&W. The M9M had beautiful tonal values, different from the color sensors of the other two, also very nice tonal values.

I've had the M9M, which ultimately suffered sensor corrosion and I traded in for the MM246. Loved the M9M, I tend to agree with some of the reviewers out there that it was marginally better at separating whites and very light greys than the MM246. Shadows are wonderfully malleable, even moderately blown highlights are gone forever on either of them. Still, I've gotten GREAT stuff with the MM246 and have no plans to sell it--it is a great camera in its size class. Why not the new monochrom? Simple. Pricing on used Phase One (P1) gear has come down so much that it competes with Leica. No, they are not travel, street, or sports cameras, but for studio, fashion and landscape work they are wonderful. I've been shooting an IQ250 back recently (50 MP CMOS color, 33 x 44 mm) and it clearly outperforms my M240 and SL in terms of image malleability. Carefully done b/w separations from the P1 color files are essentially equivalent to the MM246 files (e.g. Leica's 24 MP CMOS sensor without the bayer array is in my experience in the same league as the 50 MP P1 with the bayer array). I've considered the new monochrom, but am instead pursuing a P1 IQ260 achromatic back (CCD, approx. 45 x 60 mm). I've reviewed achromatic P1 sample files, and they are genuinely impressive--I have seen nothing close to their level of highlight recovery with my MM246. Resolution-wise, I could have stopped back with the 18 MP M9M. I mostly only print up to Super-B (13 x 19\") but even the ISO 1600 shots that I printed to that size were a real treat. At lower ISO I can see grain etc. on-screen at high zoom factors, but the reality is that none of it is noticeable in the prints. And yes, I have gone to bigger prints, and the files hold up well. There are two great photography museums near me--the Annenberg and the Getty--and there are no shortage of prints being exhibited that are no larger than 11 x 14\". So while it's nice to be able to \"go big\", well, good work looks good in a broad range of sizes. In this race to pack ever more pixels into less and less sensor space, I wonder if we're not missing the boat.

Being partially color blind (red deficiency) I don't trust my interpretation of color files. I once took a Cibachrome printing course, worked on a print of Half Dome for about 4 hours until it was perfect, then proudly took it to the instructor who gasped and said, \"My God! Who bled all over this picture?\" Today it's not enough to set the white balance and \"get away\" with letting your software and calibrated printer do the heavy lifting. Most of any successes I've had with photography have been with Black and White, and like so many people on the Forum, I started many decades ago with a film camera and BW film that we processed in darkrooms we built in the basement of our parents' homes.

Here is the M9 ICF that I measured versus a typical ICF. --img--  I would like to study the color response and light transmission, and ideally we would have your opinions, MaxMax and Kolari. First some anecdotical points showing the importance to me of the color response which is much of the appeal of the Leica M9: 1. I used to have 5-6 years ago a Leica M9-P which had an official sensor change by Leica. The color response of the sensor had however changed, and was not just a matter of White Balance - the color palette was nice, but different; also in addition the pictures became slightly sharper, luminosity was slightly reduced and the images slightly colder (not as Kodachrome like anymore). As you know the firmware was updated after the official sensor change, which is not the case for the suggested \"only glass change\" solutions - so same camera RGB response. 2. Due to this I had bought again a Leica M9 with original sensor without corrosion at the time - I think it was one of the first ones produced - (with the feeling that if something happened I could still have the official sensor changed). The colors are indeed more like Kodachrome. I could not check the camera in time to see the spots that now in retrospect seem to have appeared around July 2020 especially since there was no pre-announcement by Leica that the sensor change program would end in Aug. Either way, I would like to stick to the \"old\" colours as much as possible if I aim to perform such as sensor glass change. Based on data from Schott, and as non expert, I am trying to understanding the color response of the two solutions being suggested, original M9, MaxMax and Kolari: - On the original M9, the original sensor cover glass was S8612 0.8mm (based on comments on this forum). Schott's official transmission data sheet here: https://shop.schott.com/medias/schott-bandpass-s8612-jun-2017-en.pdf?context=bWFzdGVyfHJvb3R8Nzk3ODUzfGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL3BkZnxoM2YvaGFlLzg4MjAyMzQ3ODA3MDIucGRmfDUzYzE4ZGI3OWY5NDU4MzY3NDZhZDc1OTk1MGQyZWU0Mzc3N2UyM2EyYWM2ZjI1MzI5ZGMzZTgwZDI2ZjNlOGQ - MaxMax: replacement cover glass BG38 0.8mm.

He disconnected it and avoided a fire. I added a fan to my home one. I'm not sure Apple ever offered any modification to fix the problem. From the beginning though, computers were sold with a limited effective life span which (for the mac) has increased over time. I still have 2 iMacs, one is a 2007 model which has been my youTube server for a few years now after retiring from home computer duty. The CD drive failed years ago and the hard drive failed yesterday! It's still running on an external drive but not well. Still, 13 years. My 2012 model is 8 years old now and it's still my basic home computer and its pretty effective at it. Macs tend to do very well in service, but nobody expects them to last for 80 years. And no other modern manufacturer tries to make cameras like that these days. Even the old Nikon and Contax rangefinders which were built quite well aren't quite up to Leica's longevity standards. After all, camera manufacturers WANT you to buy new cameras ... eventually. Building an M2 that will last 60 years isn't exactly the way to make you buy more Ms... or is it? Certainly that rugged longevity did kind of make me want to keep buying Leicas (I've only bought 6 Ms so I'm pretty much a piker, and they've all been used models too). As I said previously, the Q (and Q2) are interesting Leicas to look at relating to the M models. It kind of looks like an M. It's really well built (but not to M standards). It has a fixed lens but a very good one (to keep from competing with Ms?). I think it's weather sealed (I don't think the Ms are). It has AF and I think it has image stabilization too as well as a macro mode. It gets rid of the rangefinder in favor of a really nice EVF. In a way, except for the fixed lens, it's a fairly modern spec camera. And the cost for the camera and lens is pretty amazingly low (for Leica). If the Q2 was turned into the Leica M11 by giving it an M mount (sadly losing the AF) but retaining the image stabilization, it would be (presumably) way cheaper than an M is now (on a par with the Cls at least) but would be a full frame camera with modern specs. It would NOT have the build quality of the Ms or the expectation (even if implicit) of long survival. Owners wouldn't expect lifetime service or longer service than a Sony RX1R or a Sony a7R4. It would reflect a total transition from the \"we make cameras that last forever\" model to the \"we make great cameras with reasonable life spans.\" Leica might not be ready to cannibalize their sales of Ms (with all the special editions and variants) yet, but as more digital Ms become doorstops, it might result in failing demand for them and we might end up with a new \"M\" based on a camera like that. Maybe that would be a little sad to us M owners, but maybe it would be for the best.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/312105-leica-discontinues-ccd-m9-and-variants-sensor-production/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-4040416", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "312105-leica-discontinues-ccd-m9-and-variants-sensor-production", "result": true, "Selector": "we make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "on 9/3/2020 at 4:20 pm, martinot said: yes, i checked the apple support data base. the mac plus is no longer serviced by apple (just like the apple ii machines i collect): https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201624 the mac plus (i had one in 1984) is an interesting parallel to the m9. it was a good machine with a serious design flaw. in the plus' case it was (if i remember right) the flyback transformer which tended to fail (or even catch on fire) when it overheated. the \"fix\" for customers was to buy a fan that would slot in the top and help to keep it from overheating. a friend of mine's plus (at e systems in florida) started to smoke on his desk. he disconnected it and avoided a fire. i added a fan to my home one. i'm not sure apple ever offered any modification to fix the problem. from the beginning though, computers were sold with a limited effective life span which (for the mac) has increased over time. i still have 2 imacs, one is a 2007 model which has been my youtube server for a few years now after retiring from home computer duty. the cd drive failed years ago and the hard drive failed yesterday! it's still running on an external drive but not well. still, 13 years. my 2012 model is 8 years old now and it's still my basic home computer and its pretty effective at it. macs tend to do very well in service, but nobody expects them to last for 80 years. and no other modern manufacturer tries to make cameras like that these days. even the old nikon and contax rangefinders which were built quite well aren't quite up to leica's longevity standards. after all, camera manufacturers want you to buy new cameras ... eventually. building an m2 that will last 60 years isn't exactly the way to make you buy more ms... or is it? certainly that rugged longevity did kind of make me want to keep buying leicas (i've only bought 6 ms so i'm pretty much a piker, and they've all been used models too). as i said previously, the q (and q2) are interesting leicas to look at relating to the m models. it kind of looks like an m. it's really well built (but not to m standards). it has a fixed lens but a very good one (to keep from competing with ms?). i think it's weather sealed (i don't think the ms are). it has af and i think it has image stabilization too as well as a macro mode. it gets rid of the rangefinder in favor of a really nice evf. in a way, except for the fixed lens, it's a fairly modern spec camera. and the cost for the camera and lens is pretty amazingly low (for leica). if the q2 was turned into the leica m11 by giving it an m mount (sadly losing the af) but retaining the image stabilization, it would be (presumably) way cheaper than an m is now (on a par with the cls at least) but would be a full frame camera with modern specs. it would not have the build quality of the ms or the expectation (even if implicit) of long survival. owners wouldn't expect lifetime service or longer service than a sony rx1r or a sony a7r4. it would reflect a total transition from the \"-----> we !!!  -----> make !!!  cameras that last forever\" model to the \"-----> we !!!  -----> make !!!  great cameras with reasonable life spans.\" leica might not be ready to cannibalize their sales of ms (with all the special editions and variants) yet, but as more digital ms become doorstops, it might result in failing demand for them and we might end up with a new \"m\" based on a camera like that. maybe that would be a little sad to us m owners, but maybe it would be for the best.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 32958, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "haikos", "date": "2020-08-18 22:42:00", "content": " Hi everyone, I just returned from my first trip with my newly acquired ME and made a few mistakes.

I did recording for about 10 years. Good mics, like Schoeps, DPA, Pearl, and Samar stereo ribbons. My recording hardware was from Sound Devices. When they screw up it is, \"Send us the box and we will fix it gratis.\" Regular tune-ups and/or repairs are quick, like a week, and a flat rate which is reasonable. They bend over backwards over the phone or via email to keep me happy. The 788T I have has a noisy channel 7. My last communication was send it in and we will fix it for free. Their current top of the line recorder, the Scorpio, is just under US$10K. These are quality, and expensive, products. In a double-blind test against the vaunted Nagra even the Nagra fanboys could not pick which was the better. As is stands now SD has eaten Nagra's lunch. How? Great product and world class customer support. And if a bunch of farmers in Wisconsin can do this what's going on at Leica? Being treated like a miserable penitent before the exalted priesthood is not what pleases me. It is something I will have to live with. It's a given. That's just the way it is.

If the \"Leica Guy\" is able to delaminate the M9 sensor to hot rod it I guess he can do a lot of other stuff. And when I go in there they are friendly, helpful and offer a quick turnaround. For Schoeps mic repairs I mail them to the dealer in CT, he bundles them and ships them to Germany once a month. The turnaround is about a month, no hassle. The costs are reasonable.

Maybe on my next trip to India, I'll leave everything behind, and travel only with the Leica.

Back in October 2018 I hadn't yet \"learned\" to stick to either 160 or 320 ISO, and back then I tried not to crop, as I would lose too much image quality. I was surprised to see that I had shot the attached photo at ISO 1250, as DNG of course. I wanted to play around with it last night, first in Lightroom, and then in Nik Collection. I had seen this long line of bicycles for rent in Miami Beach, and wanted to get an interesting view.

A \"jammed camera\", where shutter button would not move, and film advance would not move, but I did not look at the display when this happened but it may have been like yours. FIX From Leica Repair: This unjammed my M7 shutter, the shutter release button, the film advance system, and the electronic system: Leica service told me to put it in Bulb mode, then tap the shutter release a few times to get the shutter release to jump up, since the shutter release is probably jammed in the down position. Apparently, Bulb mode is some kind of shutter-computer reset or starting point. Well that is the best sense I can make of it. Probably the camera needs to be in the power-on position with batteries installed. It is easy to have it turned off when you think it is on. Possibly move the advance lever back & forth a little bit, and turn it off-&-on. I tried so many things that it is hard to remember the exact order of all I tried before following the above directions from Leica. CAUSE: This may have been caused by, my removing the batteries, without first turning the camera power to Off. The M7 has a computer brain that like any computer has a start & stop procedure that seems to include turning the power switch off before removing the batteries. I was sent this picture below which is supposed to be of the M7 Leica IC, integrated circuit, with IC attachment legs which give a long life circuit more so than the modern SMD, surface mount devices, that lack the attachment leg but are only soldered onto the surface. The M7 may last a long time. The M7 is one of Leica's best M cameras feature-wise. I love the M7 for its aperture priority mode which automates shutter timing as the aperture is turned. Aperture priority is all you need really since it makes the camera semi-automatic which means it is under your control and only automating to assist your decisions. Before I got my Leica, I bought a full manual FM Nikon and disliked it compared to the Nikon EL2 which has the same \"auto shutter as your turn the aperture\" as the M7.

This assuming that you stay in the same place while recomposing, like we all do. Should you just step sideways and raising/lowering the camera remaining on the same plane it would work for maintaining the subject in focus. A lens with a field curvature curving away from the lens would be even worse. But the field curvature towards the lens is more aligned with the movement of the DOF while recomposing, so you have a better chance to keep the subject within it.

Could you please detail, the opportunities which leads you to choose one or another ? I have the Elmar-M and I confess I never succeed to get the stunning results I like so much made by others, perhaps because I am taking pictures in too dim light for its small 2.8. Anyway I keep confindent to do so... Chasing the Graal I am wondering about the Apo-Summicron since that like the Elmar-M it seems capable of \"different\" results, with unsurpassed details in blacks and in lights, and for color rendition. Could you please give also comparative details on theses 2 points for these 2 lens ? I thank you all for this instructive \"back to basics\" thread.

Quite good on the M's Simply not designed for digital, but a really great lens optically. 28mm Summicron: Badly on the Sony. I sold it after that, so I cannot be sure, but my feeling is that it is has larger problems than the most recent M lenses. Brilliant on the M9 and M8 and of course film. 28mm Elmarit V3: Mine was better than the Summicron on the M9 and Sony. It is more retrofocal. Showing its age, however, on high resolution bodies. I have not tested with the SL2, but it did not seem to do as well on the M10 or S1, which I found a bit odd, as it is not that much higher in resolution than the M9. 35mm Summilux FLE: What I would consider the first M lens that is good on cameras with a bit thicker cover glass. It is still affected as compared to use on an M body, but I found it usable on the SL2 and S1 (especially when stopped down). It has some weird field curvature at times (so if you focus on infinity, the edges will be sharper closer to you than at infinity), but overall it is a great lens that handles well and takes pictures that you can't really complain about. 50mm Summilux ASPH. Oddly, this lens has more troubles than the 35mm FLE, despite being longer. I did not find it very good on the S1, and it was quite bad on the Sony cameras. This is why I bought the 50mm Summicron SL for the l mount, and I am very happy I did. I have not tried on the SL2, but I suspect the issue is the same. It is not that you cannot use it, it is just that its performance is substantially degraded. Use it on film or an M camera and you will see how much better it is in reality than it appears on these adapted bodies. 75mm Summicron ASPH. Like its close relative, the 50mm ASPH, its performance is somewhat degraded on adapted bodies for whatever reason. It is stunning on the M cameras, and while quite good and definitely usable on the adapated cameras, it is nowhere near its peak performance. 75mm Summilux Strangely, it is optically better on adapted digital than the more modern Summicron. It functions like it does on M bodies...lots of aberrations and glow wide open, it improves rapidly after 2.5 and becomes very sharp at 4, 5.6 and above. Still a fantastic and versatile lens. 90mm APO Summicron. Very very good. I noticed high detail edged to edge wide open on the SL2, though there was some spherical aberration (so it looked slightly fuzzy/double image wide open, though the detail was sharp). It improved rapidly. Other than that caveat, this is a top class lens and performs admirably. 135mm Tele-Elmar M (E46 version). Still the best bargain I ever had. I got this lens in rough condition for 250 dollars in the early 2000s before the digital M's. It is still an extraordinarily good performer. It has no issues with any of the digital bodies and performed as well or better than most native lenses. It was my sharpest lens on the Sony A series cameras, and it is great on any camera. Pretty remarkable for a design as old as it is. Wide open it has a bit of spherical aberration and maybe some CA, but from 5.6 on it is basically perfect (from my recollection). P.S. The reason I am so critical about this is that I live in Iceland and our landscapes are basically very wide open and far apart, so if you point a lens at a mountain and photograph, it becomes very obvious when the lenses have problems edge to edge. All the detail is at a very similar distance to the camera (300m, a kilometer, 30km? Usually a long way), so edge to edge sharpness issues are very obvious. If you live in forested land or in cities, this stuff is not so obvious. I also work as a printer so I often make large prints of my work in the course of my job as well as my artistic practice. Anyway, all this is relative, and someone doing portraits or street work might never notice any of these issues, in which case the M lenses become a superb choice given their small size, weight, high speed and center sharpness.

Once again, I compare the SL2-S to the Sony A7SIII because 1. it's the best hybrid solution I had until now and 2. I think Sony is a good market reference to use a comparison. It's a nice middle ground between Canon when comparing to a Leica SL series because the Sony is better than the Canon with M lenses, and the Sony is better than Nikon for video and AF. That being cleared up, here are my side by side preference in the Caterogies that matter to me so far. This is still subject to change as I've just been using the SL2-S for two weeks, and I said I would use it for one month without touching the Sony before I make a final decision. - Stills IQ: Leica wins (BY FAR). The image that it produces are so sharp and beautiful. The color science of the DNG files is so impressive that I didn't even know it was possible to produce Raw files that different from the rest. Nothing beats Leica here. - Video IQ: Leica wins. The codec is nicer, retains better information, and has a beautiful color science, similar than the stills, that is so malleable and enjoyable to grade. The stabilisation, while its not an important feature to me, is also far better on the Leica than the Sony. - Low light: Leica wins. To my surprise, as the Sony in a reference in that domain. But Leica retains the color so much better, and I prefer the fine filmic grain that is introduced at high iso rather than the over demonised look of the sony. - Portability: Sony wins. It feels half the size and half the weight. Very impressive for all it packs and all it can do. - Ergonomics & looks : Leica wins (BY FAR). It's built like a tank, and it looks gorgeous. - Lens options: Leica wins. I love that M lenses adapt so well. it's like having an M body. and the SL lenses are something out of this world. Cant compare them to the Sony plastic lens. Not even the G masters. - Enjoyability: Leica wins (BY FAR). It's inspiring. Such a pleasure to go out to take photos with it. I love that the Photo and Video menu are separated and so simple to navigate. Extreme opposite of Sony here, where nothing ever makes senses. - Battery life: Leica wins. - Autofocus performance: Sony wins. While the AFs is enough for me in stills on the SL2S, it doesn't come close to compete against Sony's Eye AF and Animal eye AF. But since I don't do action (other than my kids) and sports, I can live with it. For video, however, the AFc of the Leica is just awful, and I consider it an MF video camera. I can live with this in 90% of the scenarios I shoot it. But it's still a pity. - Screen and EVF: Leica wins, with a caveat. The EvF, while being higher spec'd on the Sony, is much nice on the Leica. Colors just look better, and its more enjoyable to me. The screen, while it's way better on the Leica, doesn't tilt up, and I feel really sad about this. I understand why It doesn't (weatherproofing and durability) but for MF in video, its really not convenient and might become with time a source of back ache. I hate the flip out screen of the sony too though. I liked better the tilt up version, which was enough for MF in video. Flip out screens are made from vloggers. I hate them because I find it very disturbing when the screen is not aligned right behind the lens. it makes everything harder and less intuitive to me. - Weather proofing: its never something I cared for, but its really a nice bonus to be able to leave the camera in the rain without caring. I've crazy videos on instagram of people showering the SL2 with an SL lens under a hose, literally. I wonder how weatherproof it is with M lenses and the Leica M-L adapter. Anyone knows?

Hi Steven - thanks for all your posts around the SL2-S, very helpful and informative. Apologies if you\u2019ve already covered this but for stills are you setting Pre-Focus to the factory default of \u2018on\u2019. When the SL2 came out (and I bought one of the first) reviews were mixed as to whether this was helpful or not, some suggested it ate through batteries for little gain AF performance wise whilst others suggested it was essential to increase the AF performance?", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/316065-is-the-sl2-s-the-perfect-hybrid-camera-to-me-the-answer-is/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-4105967", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "316065-is-the-sl2-s-the-perfect-hybrid-camera-to-me-the-answer-is", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "22 hours ago, steven said: a quick update on where i stand so far on the original question in the title. once again, i compare the sl2-s to the sony a7siii because 1. it's the best hybrid solution i had until now and 2. i think sony is a good market reference to use a comparison. it's a nice middle ground between canon when comparing to a leica sl series because the sony is better than the canon with m lenses, and the sony is better than nikon for video and af. that being cleared up, here are my side by side preference in the caterogies that matter to me so far. this is still subject to change as -----> i !!! 've just been using the sl2-s for two weeks, and -----> i !!!  said -----> i !!!  would use it for one month without touching the sony before -----> i !!!  -----> make !!!  a final decision. - stills iq: leica wins (by far). the image that it produces are so sharp and beautiful. the color science of the dng files is so impressive that i didn't even know it was possible to produce raw files that different from the rest. nothing beats leica here. - video iq: leica wins. the codec is nicer, retains better information, and has a beautiful color science, similar than the stills, that is so malleable and enjoyable to grade. the stabilisation, while its not an important feature to me, is also far better on the leica than the sony. - low light: leica wins. to my surprise, as the sony in a reference in that domain. but leica retains the color so much better, and i prefer the fine filmic grain that is introduced at high iso rather than the over demonised look of the sony. - portability: sony wins. it feels half the size and half the weight. very impressive for all it packs and all it can do. - ergonomics & looks : leica wins (by far). it's built like a tank, and it looks gorgeous. - lens options: leica wins. i love that m lenses adapt so well. it's like having an m body. and the sl lenses are something out of this world. cant compare them to the sony plastic lens. not even the g masters. - enjoyability: leica wins (by far). it's inspiring. such a pleasure to go out to take photos with it. i love that the photo and video menu are separated and so simple to navigate. extreme opposite of sony here, where nothing ever makes senses. - battery life: leica wins. - autofocus performance: sony wins. while the afs is enough for me in stills on the sl2s, it doesn't come close to compete against sony's eye af and animal eye af. but since i don't do action (other than my kids) and sports, i can live with it. for video, however, the afc of the leica is just awful, and i consider it an mf video camera. i can live with this in 90% of the scenarios i shoot it. but it's still a pity. - screen and evf: leica wins, with a caveat. the evf, while being higher spec'd on the sony, is much nice on the leica. colors just look better, and its more enjoyable to me. the screen, while it's way better on the leica, doesn't tilt up, and i feel really sad about this. i understand why it doesn't (weatherproofing and durability) but for mf in video, its really not convenient and might become with time a source of back ache. i hate the flip out screen of the sony too though. i liked better the tilt up version, which was enough for mf in video. flip out screens are made from vloggers. i hate them because i find it very disturbing when the screen is not aligned right behind the lens. it makes everything harder and less intuitive to me. - weather proofing: its never something i cared for, but its really a nice bonus to be able to leave the camera in the rain without caring. i've crazy videos on instagram of people showering the sl2 with an sl lens under a hose, literally. i wonder how weatherproof it is with m lenses and the leica m-l adapter. anyone knows? so overall, the only two things were the sony wins for my use is: - portability. i don't really care for this. and when i really want a smaller package, i can always use my q2, or even my m. -af. of course, that's the biggest flaw of the sl2 and it might never be fixed, but im willing to try a little harder to make it work. i just have to get unhooked to the simple auto life. if only the screen would tilt up, it might have come close to the perfect camera for me. but i love it anyway. will i sell the sony? to be continued... hi steven - thanks for all your posts around the sl2-s, very helpful and informative. apologies if you\u2019ve already covered this but for stills are you setting pre-focus to the factory default of \u2018on\u2019. when the sl2 came out (and i bought one of the first) reviews were mixed as to whether this was helpful or not, some suggested it ate through batteries for little gain af performance wise whilst others suggested it was essential to increase the af performance?", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 31747, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "HeinzX", "date": "2020-10-03 09:33:00", "content": "The lack of stabilisation really is disturbing for use on the SL or on the CL.

Our battery power limits seem to be carrying one extra battery and shooting over part of a day, recharging at night. That makes sense. Now how do we make our arguments match up with the priorities of Mr. Stefan Daniel and his team in Wetzlar? They probably want to see Leica Camera AG produce and maintain products that bring in enough revenue at a low enough cost to keep Mr Kaufmann and his heirs happy, so that they do not retreat to Salzburg, leaving behind an empty palace like the elegant buildings Hasselblad abandoned a few years ago in Gothenburg. And each of them is responsible for the continued employment of a fair number of people who are Leica's institutional memory. In this framework, it is possible to see why Fotos is doing the following: Write one app, which talks to a consistent interface for BT and WiFi in each camera line. I hope they are doing this in Wetzlar, where the camera engineers can talk to the app programmers, but the temptation to let it all get done by contractors in India must have been strong. Every country has a ministry of communications that only lets products be shipped into their country if they don't endanger the nation, so stick to standard chips with embedded firmware and protocols that have international acceptance.

One other thing I am sure of is that I personally have got nowhere near achieving the same results I used to get with my Canon 5D4 and 100-400 II, but I made my choice to move to mirrorless and Leica land and I am happy to be here. I also feel given time and maybe some firmware updates (perhaps CL2), a whole lot more effort on my part, there is more to come from the Sigma. Happy shooting everyone. It's always interesting and educational to read your thoughts, Jayne. My experience with the Canon 100-400 II was same as yours, as is my current feeling about \"Leica land.\" A couple of things give me cause for some optimism about the Sigma 100-400mm: the rumors site report about Sigma's travails with the AF algorithm on an upcoming zoom lens; and that I get decent results with the Sigma on the SL.

How else would one implement \"digital zoom\"? You can't create data out of thin air, you simply take what you get and fit it to the desired space. Yes, it works for any lens, not just TL lenses. 6 hours ago, jaapv said: Ah - I see. Apart from the framelines (which I have no use for as I find it better to estimate the crop that I will apply more precisely on my computer screen - it is mostly not centered) it is a feature for JPG shooters. I had a small hope that Leica had implemented an algorithm that was better than simple cropping - clearly not. Thanks guys, it saves me the trouble to try it out. Here is a quick example of the function shown in Lightroom Classic, Develop module, with the crop mode enabled. I made three exposures, one full-frame, one with 1.3x crop, and one with 1.7x crop, using an M-mount Summilux 35mm lens. The output DNGs have the framing dimensions modified to suit the crop. The resulting pixel counts and FoV are easily visible. Full frame: 35mm is 'normal' on the CL format, equivalent to a ~50mm lens on FF format. --img--  Crop 1.3x: ...equivalent ~65mm lens on FF format. --img--  Crop 1.7x: ...equivalent to an ~85mm lens on FF format. --img--  I find it useful in the same way that the frame line lever on my M4-2 is useful: Looking through the viewfinder, a previsualization tool. Regards the file numbering: Whenever I do a shooting session and arrive home to look at the exposures I've made, I upload them to the computer and delete them from the camera, I erase them from the camera. So I'm always in folder 100 on the camera and the file numbers always roll up sequentially. I don't do this when I'm on travel, but then I never do a firmware upgrade when I'm traveling.

I also made further tests with different light conditions (natural daylight, although very cloudy). I think my initial testing and problem description could have been better if I am a more experienced photographer, but in my case it was half testing half photography learning. First, my tests in chronological order and my conclusion based on your inputs. Tl;dr also at the end I downloaded the pictures to my iPhone (easiest way to check them) and noticed that the daylight shots seem better (less yellowish) on the iPhone screen, compared to the camera LCD. At that point I thought that the camera might be correct, but the LCD could have some problem. I found topics on this forum that indicated problems with camera LCDs. Side-by-side, the iPhone screen looked \"whiter\" while the camera had the tint. I found the monitor color adjustment setting, which changed the screen a little bit, but not so much. I then remembered that when I bought my iPhone (XS) I found it to be more yellowish than the previous one, and I went into the settings and changed the hue to blue. And ever since then I used my phone with that setting, which to my eye looked more natural (many reported the same experience after the X: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250699527). I changed it back to the default now, and voila, the two screens were identical (but little yellowish to me). With this relevation, I checked the pictures with the low-light condition (on my iPhone with my custom hue setting), and they looked to have less tint than what I experienced initially (and what gave me the shock yesterday). Now, I would say, it's within the range of what I see as Leica JPG engine setting by the Leica engineers, although they still have a slightly different hue than the pictures from my GF3, from yesterday. I then looked at old pictures taken by the GF3 and I noticed that in different low-light conditions (different bulbs, amount of light, etc) it rendered JPGs with very different results (although mostly with way off WB), it's just this one specific room I tried yesterday seems to give me the WB and hue I like more in GF3 than TL2. It seems to be correctable with post-processing since it's not affecting a wide range of scenarios. I tried the Leica with very low but natural light and the results were excellent (again, on the iPhone screen). Conclusion, tl;dr: it seems I was used to the screen hues and tints of my iPhone (with custom setting since the beginning) and old Panasonic so much to feel that the Leica oocs are way off, but in reality they are just a little bit different than what I see as \"reality\", and only in specific artificial light conditions so far. These findings lead me to think that my unit has no physical defects. I will also put the effort to learn more post-processing and give a try to the suggested programs.

Both superb lenses, and amongst my most-used at the time I was in that format. The Nocticron post-dated my time with Micro-FourThirds system, but I recommended it to a good friend who is in love with it. I also had the Macro-Elmarit-DG 45mm f/2.8 ASPH ... a truly superb lens in every way. If I were to invest in more Micro-FourThirds equipment, I'd buy the full complement of Voigtl\u00e4nder f/0.95 lenses ... because they really work beautifully for the format and allow the focus zone control that's needed. But I went the other way and went for a big sensor camera in the Hasselblad 907x. It was a choice, and I decided this had more value for me.

Scamazon is more like it... I received a counterfeit Nikon Battery from them... thats why their Return/exchange policy is so good. I don't buy anything from them! I loves to Travel. I have never been North on an Amtrak train before. Never been to Boston either.. Sooo.. I took a few days off from work. Took a LIRR from Long Island to NYC and then caught me a Regional to Beantown. This was a Solo trip so i had to make the best of it. Found my room and settled in.. woke up early and then took a 15 minute walk to the Leica Boutique. We Have a Leica Boutique in Manhattan but they didn't have one when i was ready. The Sales folk were really cool and the chap Enrique was very helpful.

I got gas, then I got hit by the side effects. I got too much gear, and now I live in a constant frustration trying to decide which to use when, and of course always regretting. For me, it all started with the search for the perfect camera. I could have been the Canon R5, for example, which on paper is perfect, on a Sony equivalent. Until you try Leica. Which I did. And it messed me up badly. I fell in love with the image the combination of the Leica sensors and lenses. I got an M10R, a few M lenses, and a Q2, next to my newly acquired Sony A7SIII. It took me a lot of time, buying, selling, re buying, to realise the following: -The M is the camera that I use when I want to feel good and look good. It's got style, and it makes you feel like a real photographer. It also produces a sublime image. But at the end of the day, when I really go out to take photos, it doesn't suit my style that well. It's not reactive enough. It makes me miss opportunities, it makes me miss focus (obviously), and it makes me miss the right composition way too often. I could only seriously rely on it for careless photo walks or 10% of what I like to shoot. Landscapes and composites. -The Q2 is my perfect stills camera. Of course its not perfect, but its perfect enough for me. It ticks enough boxes that I could safely shoot 90% of what I like to photograph and have it as my main camera. It has the best IQ of any camera ive ever used. A superb lens, so sharp that it makes me forget about my main focal length (35) and accept to live with a 28. It's good looking, its small, it's AF is fast enough and surely will only get better with time. It's extremely versatile and even has a Macro mode. I enjoy this camera SO SO much. So why this is not enough for me? Because I also like video. 40% of the time, I shoot video. And I don't know when I go out of the house if ill shoot photos of videos, so I need both in one camera. -Takes me to my third camera: The Sony A7SIII. Best video on the market, best AF on the market, excellent stills even with just 12MP, best low light capabilities on the market. I use it with some excellent sony lenses such as the 24GM and the 50 Zeiss. I also adapt my M lenses on it with great results. So this, on paper, is the perfect camera for me (near perfect, I should say, perfect would be with 24MP). Why cant I make it my only system since it offers me everything I need? Well, because it's not a Leica. While the stills are excellent and often can be very closely matched to a Leica, it does not reach the IQ level of the Q2. But more importantly, because it's not inspiring like a Leica. Its not fun to use, it doesn't make you feel good like an M, a Q, or an SL. Of course, ive tried the SL as an alternative to my sony, but while its incredible for stills, it doesn't cut it for video. I think the SL2S will be a better option for me, but it will miss two boxes to become a real contenter to replace my sony: the tilt screen and the bad AF in video. So for now, I will have to give up on my dream to be \"liberated\", like the OP, with only one all rounder camera. I will have to stick with this torture of having the Sony and the Q as my two main cameras.

I made my so-called living as a commercial photographer for fifty+ years, but never had a shot as lucky as this. This is an image made in 2006 with a V-Lux-1 \u2013\u2013a rare bird! We'd had a huge storm overnight, so first thing in the morning I jumped into the car and took off all over the county to photograph. Got some good images but liked this view, from my driveway when I returned. Raised the camera to my eye, took one photo. Then the birds flew into the frame. Then the birds were gone. Never saw them coming; didn't see where they went. No photoshop, except curves etc. Loved the camera, but unfortunately, a very small sensor.

In the end I went for Camera Leather (cameraleather.com). As far as my concern, CameraLeather.com has the most supported cameras. All my \"vintage\" cameras can find the support. The first one I installed is Rollei 35S (so far this is the only one, I will see how it goes before step into the second), which can only be found in CameraLeather. All others only support Rollei 35, not Rollei 35S. The most helpful from CameraLeather is the owner is very knowledgeable and very welling to give detailed technical guidance. The worst is the Italian named Asian camera case supplier. The price is an order magnitude higher and poor support. Be careful when choosing the material, particularly on the thickness. It matters for the durability, not just how it feels. You want the skin to perfectly matches the camera's side frame. Too thin will expose the side frame and feels incomplete, while too thick might be easy to rub off. Ask the supplier about this. All suppliers sell the whole skin kit, usually it contains at least the front piece and the back piece. But I found installing only the front piece may also make sense. Now I have the two tone skin on my Rollei 35S. The front is the dark red and the back is the original black. I made this decision when I found installing the back piece on Rollei 35s (and Rollei 35) might look insecure due to the hand strap connect construction (not sure if this feeling is real).

I was wondering if you found a solution to your issue and if so, if you wouldn't mind sharing it? Hi @Lentakis, Nope, no solution yet. It seems this has been posted in the wrong forum, since I definitely saw some members talking about these issues in the past, but perhaps they have all moved on to other forums now :( Anyway, for what its worth, perhaps you could describe your camera and problem in more detail and we could compare notes and see if there are any differences that will help us narrow down the issue. To start with, do you only have the stuck shutter problem, or do you also face the shutter button not depressing fully issue? Do you get the LED displays in the viewfinder and does metering work properly with the battery inserted? Lastly, when the shutter gets stuck, are you able to \"knock\" it loose by gently, well, knocking the camera on a pillow or some such thing? I notice also that after I leave the camera alone for a day or two, I can always get 2-3 shutter releases before the shutter gets stuck again. This seems to imply to me that the sticky magnet issue is probably definitely one of my problems. But I am unable to address the fact that the shutter button does not want to depress fully in electronic modes. Since I have no working camera to compare with, I do not know if that is normal behaviour or not. If someone else reads this, it doesn't matter if you don't have an R4, could you check on your R camera and let me know how the shutter is supposed to behave?

First of all, if you enjoy using your R9 for film, and propose to continue so to do, then factor in the cost of a second R9 body on which to mount a DMR. I don't think repeated swapping in use would be a good idea, and personally I wouldn't care for the inconvenience. Secondly, if the DMR goes wrong, then it's a paperweight. Dealers I suspect would only sell on an as is basis - though you should be able to drive a good bargain as a result. I know of a UK dealer who has one in his collection, but can't list it for sale because it can't be serviced. PM me if you would like the name - they may be willing also to sell as is. Thirdly, and very obviously, it's high ISO performance is very limited by today's standards, and it's resolution at 10Mp is also very limited. Fourthly, battery cell replacement needs at least to be considered in the medium to longer term, though replacement is possible (paulmac has details of someone in the UK who can do motor drives, and I'd bet he could do DMR cell replacement). At present, I am enjoying getting back to film with my R9, and use my M240 with R-M adapter and EVF2. It's a good solution for static subjects and tripod work. Yes, I have one that I hesitate to sell too - it even comes with five batteries (two refurbished), but I'd better keep it instead of selling it and having it break down irreparably just after sale. So it is a memento on my desk. In fact, it is the very last one refurbished by Leica, they used the last parts they had on it.

I avoided the AF failure fiasco (after my Leica 120 spent an unduly long time in the hospital in Germany) by getting the Contax-Leica adapter plus the 55 3/5 and the 80 f2 lenses. Very happy with these two, solid, reliable, really fine glass. Re your initial question, I wouldn't worry too much about the risks. You can minimize the risk of course by buying lenses that are either new (not new old stock!) or have been upgraded with the new AF module (from certified dealers that tell you exactly what you will get). Your S007 adds a bit more mechanical stress on the lenses, mind. I am using an S006, and the 120 now behaves as it should (probably the best portrait lens I've ever owned). i have the planar 80mm f2, 35mm 3.2, 45mm 2.8, 120mm Apo makro, and the 140mm f2.8. All fantastic lenses and shines on the S. But majority of the time I use the 80mm f2 for travel and portraiture. Sadly it\u2019s also the one that hunts like crazy. Maybe it\u2019s the copy I own.

Im not sure how/where to put the M9 (sold many years ago, thinking of getting a refurbushed), but regarding more recent bodies, I will say (colour wise): S006 > SL2 > SL > M240. M9 actually has different color characteristics to S2/S006 even they are all CCD. S2/S006 are a lot more neutral and pleasing in my eyes compare almost slid film rendering M9. I like m9 compare to later M240 or M10 but I don't have strong preference, I feel they(m9,m10,m240) are just different. certainly I don't have the same strong preference as S006 to S007 in term of color rendering. Both M10 and M240 have quite similar color treatment to me with slightly better response from M10. They both offer neutral (a little muted) color IMHO. I don't think they are shining for color tonality compare to other digital body but they do both offer easy to deal with color for skin tone for portraits and good not on your face color for other application. S007 was a downgrade for me in term of color, this is one of biggest disappointments I have with the S system now. S was really shining for color work especially for Portrait and this was one of biggest selling point of the system and admittedly one of the reason I was buying into the system. I can definitely make S007 images works but I couldn't help thinking what if those images made with early S? Having said that, S007 is a much improved system in term of real world using that offer many advantage to S006/S2 I appreciate. I am patiently waiting for more S3 images to make judgement. SL2 has very nice color, strong but also pleasing. I had Panasonic S1 as well, surprisingly these two are quite similar that both offer strong orange and red hue resolution which I personally prefer. I think Panasonic is really know color from their video background. SL2 is benefit from that through this alliance. SL2 is my favorite digital body, bar none due to superb UI and compatibility it has with S, R and M glasses. I couldn't ask for more.

That's not to say that the implementation details haven't changed, but the overall idea is the same. There's a phase-detection sensor at the bottom of the mirror box. That's the same system that every AF SLR has used since the Minolta Maxxum (a system originally invented by Leica). Phase-detect sensors, in a simplified explanation, are two sensors, one focused slightly in front of the image plane, and one slightly behind. The camera looks at the phase difference between the two, and focuses toward the one that is less sharp. It stops focusing when both images are equally sharp. That's what makes it fast, it knows which direction to focus the lens, and it stops when adequate sharpness is achieved. There are a few problems with this approach: it can only focus on one point per sensor, and it is limited in how finely it focuses. In a general way, sensors can be either good at smaller (darker) apertures, or accurate, but not both. When in live-view mode, focus is determined by maximum sharpness/contrast on the sensor. That's essentially the same way you would do it on a view camera with a magnifier. This system is slower, but more accurate. It can also be used at any point in the image. Some sensors have phase-detect elements on board, so they work in live-view. There is no indication that the S3's sensor is of this type. The same caveats apply: limited (though larger) number of focus points, limited accuracy. In addition, the phase-detect elements create \"gaps\" in the image which need to be filled-in, and they create more heat, which can limit DR. Some users also report banding issues with PDAF sensors. Many newer cameras use a hybrid system in live view: they use phase-detect to get \"almost focus,\" and then switch to contrast detect (provided they have the time). Panasonic's DFD system (used in SL, S1, S1R, SL2) uses complex lens mapping to achieve a kind of pseudo-phase-detect. It guesses which way to focus based on known characteristics of the lens. The big picture, which people seem to be missed in these discussions, is that AF system always find something to focus, but they don't know what should be in focus, in order to convey the intended emotional message. That's the photographer's job. I use my own hybrid system with the S: I push on the rear focus button when I need to make a big correction (from near to far, for instance), and then I fine-focus by eye. Tiny changes in focus make big differences in the impact of a photograph, and the odds of a camera and myself being on the same wavelength (wavefront?) are minimal. Often I will take two pictures in quick succession , using different focus points, because they convey completely different emotions.

Thanks! After reading that, I find it interesting to compare how I have always used manual focus SLR lenses (S007, R9, Nikon F2) to focus near and far through the focus plane I want, so that I can tweak it back and forth until the viewfinder seems to show it the sharpest. Of course it's different with every lens because the base aperture is different and lets in different amounts of light to see and focus (f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8). Since I wear glasses, I've always relied on diopter adjustments so I can shoot without glasses, but that introduces yet another variable. What complicates this is that the SL, SL2 seem to have such great focus systems, but they are 100% EVF and no optical VF, which is an incredible experience on the S. I do not shoot fast moving people or objects with the S, so for me, the focusing works well. I could see how other uses might have limitations. I'm a fan of the rear focus button to get me started and manual after that if needed. Not to be off topic, but I also prefer the non-micro prism focusing screens, because the cross in the center is easy to use as a point to focus with the AF system. It may be harder to focus ultimately and if I had my choice, I would love to have a full microprism screen and a full matte screen for manual focusing, similar to the Nikon focusing screen choices I find the small circles are not large enough for my eyes to quickly find the focus, but a full screen let's me compare more quickly and find the sharpest points.

They look up to my expectations. The images I took were of people in the street of Manhattan and of urban landscape in early March 2020. I had no chance to continue as they lock everything down and therefore i had no chance to print bigger. one thing though about the Sl2 is that for some subject matter i really like the fast pace capabilities. One funny thing is that I had to go back to the store to disable the screen touch as i was moving the focus point with the tip of my nose while shooting. But the camera is really easy at AF and super fast. i had the 90 and the 24 90 zoom. The ergonomics are great and it seemed after few days that the camera had alway been mine. I need glasses to read so for me it is kind of weird to rely on a screen on the back of the camera if not just for the histogram. For me the less setting i have to set the better. I believe the Sl2 and more the 007 would be a good fit for my habits of avoiding the electronics settings in camera, as i only look for time speed, the f stop, and a correct exposure in every camera. I want to make sure the camera is more reliable and the the previous ones i had and capable to print big landscape images with superb details and colors.

I also have the SL2 and have tried the 50mp Fuji. My job is as an exhibition printer as well as a photographer, so I have a pretty good idea around print quality. I found that the resolution between the S006 and Fuji 50mp is comparable enough not to be a big issue. The difference is more around the lenses. The Fuji 65mm seems to be a bit flatter in field than the S 70mm, so if you are doing landscape work, it might be more reliably sharp across the frame. That said, the 70mm Summarit is lovely for portraits and in no way unsharp, it just has enough field curvature that you need to be at f6.8 or smaller to ensure edge to edge sharpness at infinity in landscape work. The 45mm and 120mm S lenses are absolutely remarkable, and you do not need to think about how you use them...I am exceptionally critical of lenses, and these two have nothing to criticize. The APO Summicron SL lenses are in this boat as well. I have not had enough experience with the Fuji to rate the lenses other than the 65mm, but I have heard great things. At around 100cmX150cm, the S2, 006 and 007 produce around 120dpi if you do not crop substantially. While this may sound low, it presents as very sharp even from close distances, provided that you have maximized your sharpness in taking the photo (especially with the 45 or 120 lenses, using a tripod). The GFX100 will have the resolution edge, but I think there are few usage cases where the file from the S will be unacceptable and the GFX will be acceptable. The GFX has the advantage of the extra resolution and stabilization, the Leica has its own unique look and color properties. In this case, I think the biggest challenges are more regarding how you like to use the camera. If you are coming more from a world of manual cameras and lenses like 4x5, you will likely prefer the simplicity of the S. As a professional, you are probably more likely looking for the camera to step aside and let you make your images, rather than have it sort it out for you. Personally, though I have the SL2 and love it, it is still less joyful for me in use than the S cameras, and particularly less so than something like a Mamiya 7II or 4x5 camera. I miss the directness and simplicity of an optical viewfinder and a clear and basic control interface. While I appreciate the technology of something like the GFX, it is joyless in use. For me, that translates to worse photos. This is something intensely personal, but something which does not often enough get its due. It took me a lot of soul searching to acknowledge that I took better photos with my Hexar AF than I did with a Leica M....for the kind of photography I make with those cameras (candids, travel, family and friends), the AF and simplicity of the Hexar meant that I felt freer than I did with the M. Even though the M is extremely simple technologically, the Hexar was more simple in use, and that freed me to react more quickly and take better pictures. With my bigger work cameras, I find that I take the best pictures with 4x5, followed by the Mamiya, followed by the S. I don't think I have made any photos I would consider great with the SL2, but I have only had it a month or two. Anyway, my advice would be to think more about how you like to photograph than about the specs of the cameras, because I think all of them are more than good enough for any print size, the challenge lies more in how you like to use them.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/310335-leica-s007/?tab=comments#comment-3989087", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "310335-leica-s007", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "hi bitti, i work with the s006, 4x5 and 8x10. i also have the sl2 and have tried the 50mp fuji. my job is as an exhibition printer as well as a photographer, so i have a pretty good idea around print quality. i found that the resolution between the s006 and fuji 50mp is comparable enough not to be a big issue. the difference is more around the lenses. the fuji 65mm seems to be a bit flatter in field than the s 70mm, so if you are doing landscape work, it might be more reliably sharp across the frame. that said, the 70mm summarit is lovely for portraits and in no way unsharp, it just has enough field curvature that you need to be at f6.8 or smaller to ensure edge to edge sharpness at infinity in landscape work. the 45mm and 120mm s lenses are absolutely remarkable, and you do not need to think about how you use them...i am exceptionally critical of lenses, and these two have nothing to criticize. the apo summicron sl lenses are in this boat as well. i have not had enough experience with the fuji to rate the lenses other than the 65mm, but i have heard great things. at around 100cmx150cm, the s2, 006 and 007 produce around 120dpi if you do not crop substantially. while this may sound low, it presents as very sharp even from close distances, provided that you have maximized your sharpness in taking the photo (especially with the 45 or 120 lenses, using a tripod). the gfx100 will have the resolution edge, but i think there are few usage cases where the file from the s will be unacceptable and the gfx will be acceptable. the gfx has the advantage of the extra resolution and stabilization, the leica has its own unique look and color properties. in this case, i think the biggest challenges are more regarding how you like to use the camera. if you are coming more from a world of manual cameras and lenses like 4x5, you will likely prefer the simplicity of the s. as a professional, you are probably more likely looking for the camera to step aside and let you make your images, rather than have it sort it out for you. personally, though i have the sl2 and love it, it is still less joyful for me in use than the s cameras, and particularly less so than something like a mamiya 7ii or 4x5 camera. i miss the directness and simplicity of an optical viewfinder and a clear and basic control interface. while i appreciate the technology of something like the gfx, it is joyless in use. for me, that translates to worse photos. this is something intensely personal, but something which does not often enough get its due. it took me a lot of soul searching to acknowledge that -----> i !!!  took better photos with my hexar af than -----> i !!!  did with a leica m....for the kind of photography -----> i !!!  -----> make !!!  with those cameras (candids, travel, family and friends), the af and simplicity of the hexar meant that -----> i !!!  felt freer than -----> i !!!  did with the m. even though the m is extremely simple technologically, the hexar was more simple in use, and that freed me to react more quickly and take better pictures. with my bigger work cameras, i find that i take the best pictures with 4x5, followed by the mamiya, followed by the s. i don't think i have made any photos i would consider great with the sl2, but i have only had it a month or two. anyway, my advice would be to think more about how you like to photograph than about the specs of the cameras, because i think all of them are more than good enough for any print size, the challenge lies more in how you like to use them.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 26651, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "GoGo", "date": "2020-12-19 02:12:00", "content": "OK then.

But the way I understood it at the time, technically, there is not much necessity for 16-bit * Leica must have known in advance this discussion would come up, and I would like to hear their explanation. PR-wise they would perhaps have been better off if they just kept it at 16-bit in the specifications. * Can of worms You're right @peterv, and I like @dfarkas explanation - which makes sense. So, really, Leica would be better off putting that in their description \"14 Bit image, 16 Bit DNG.\" I am sure there are those that will nit-pick this. What I like is the comparison to other systems. Nikon, for example, publishes a 12 bit image and 14 bit DNG.

Two years ago, I discovered Leica, when I bought a Q-P. For me, it was a shock : what a lens and a shooting experience ! I also started using a M10-P, and again, after some learning curve, I was convinced with this new approach of photography (for me). Always have a small camera with me, instead of leaving my mammoth D850 with holy trinity and primes on a shelf. With my Leicas, I make a lot more pictures (for pleasure) than before. For my professional work (photography is just a part of my work) I began to explore the SL2, and apart some minor problems, I am know in the process to leave my Nikon bodies (already done with Sony, which usability and interface is, in my opinion, a nightmare). For Landscape photography, which includes pano shots, timelapses and \"normal\" pictures, I found a very good tool with the SL2 and the SL lenses (and M adapted on it). From time to time, I rent a PhaseOne XT with 32mm Rodenstock lens. I find this above all else for dynamic range, color rendering and handling, pano shots, frame averaging, ... But to rent is not a solution for me (you cannot plan in advance when the weather offers you beautiful light on a Saturday evening for example). Buying a Phase One is too much in my opinion, and it is not exactly a polyvalent tool which could be easily profitable. That's why I'm now thinking to enter in the S3 world for landscape and timelapse photography, and eventually studio work (people and objects). But I'm not fully convinced and have some questions, and I'm sure your experience could help me in this choice. - Do you think the S line will be developed after the S3 ? I'm wondering this because Leica stayed with old techs on this new body (compact flash card / maestro 2 / video specs for HDMI out / poor and closed flash system) - The Leica \"Pro format\" is not as big as the Phase One sensor. Is the difference in sensor size really significant in the results, compared to the SL2 (noise, lens rendering) ? - What are the differences in rendering between SL and S lenses ? - What are the differences in color rendering between SL2 and S3 ? - Is there a real difference in dynamic range compared to SL2 or Nikon D850 ? - Has anyone some experience in astro photography with S3 (not deep space, just Milky Way shoots for example) ?

I do not see any banding in your image, at least not anything significant. I am still doing tests on mine, and I found one thing that I was doing exacerbated the issue, but changing it has improved the image, but not eliminated the issue.

Those profiles give better color to my eye, but in high ISO images or when pushed, they show more visible noise and color contamination. The Adobe Color profile in particular seems to be desaturating the shadow detail in the high ISO images. This leads the images to look better at the extremes of ISO. My issue has been that high ISO images look worse than the SL2, despite it being a bigger, lower density sensor, and my low ISO files show banding when shadows are aggressively recovered. I do not mind grain, but dead pixels and banding are problematic. For reference, these are two photos, one from my S3 (left) and one from my SL2 (right). Both at ISO 50000 with the same noise and sharpening settings. The Leica S3 color profile at left, and Leica SL2 embedded at right. Both shot in the same light and letting the camera autoexpose.

I will take a look, much appreciated. Just to underline it here: my post was not made because I am scared of cleaning a digital sensor. I'm making sure that swab size was not as important as the internet would like you to think it is, and that no-one has had any issues with doing this over time, since Leica, as we know better than most, does not have a great track record on sensor cover-glass QA. I'm not shy about equipment maintenance either -- quite the opposite since these are my work tools, I keep a maintenance schedule going on my equipment and stick to it -- but I am cautious with expensive stuff and not afraid to ask questions and make sure.

I don't want to get into a debate so I'm not sure if I should mention the following, but since we are among friends: I have definitely heard of lens coatings being damaged by regular lens cleaning fluids. I used Nikon before Leica, and was told directly by a Nikon service engineer that lens cleaning fluids can degrade lens coatings, and to stay off wet-cleans as much as possible (wet cleans as a last resort). The dust on a front element may look bad but it does not show up in the photos -- I think Roger Cicala showed that you need to basically draw on an element with a marker pen to get something to show up -- but this guy assured me that doing wet cleans (with lens cleaner) over time would degrade lens coats. I had no reason to doubt him. And I follow that advice to this day: I don't mess about with coated optical glass unless there is a solid reason to. I have a few S lenses, I think I've wet cleaned my S70's (I have two, one for backup) a grand total of three times in four years, and zero wet cleans for all the others (S120 Makro, S-K 120 T/S, S35 Summarit)---a few lens-pen passes on them, maybe. I can't even recall. Just blower a lot, and take sensible care with them. Never had any issues. They all look super clean. And for 2) I would not have assumed sensor cover glass gets the same coat as lens elements do. So that's interesting to hear. Where did you learn that jaapv? No cross-examining intended, just curious. I'm not an expert, that's the problem, but yea, I wouldn't have thought to make that assumption. So, you learn something everyday \ud83d\udc4d Thanks again.

So far I've been processing my way out of color issues in Photoshop; it's not best practice but I just take the trade off (convenience when shooting for inconvenience in post). To deal with it in post I made a couple of quick fix tools for myself, for instance shooting a few layers of clear plastic to get a reference frame for the color pollution, then add that reference frame as a layer in Ps (invert and set blend mode to color, reduce opacity to taste); it's basically what large format guys were doing for fixing lens color cast issues when shifting with digital backs (not a problem anymore for high end guys with IQ4 150's, the BSI sensor backs). I chucked that fix away last year as the pollution is not super consistent, and I found most times it's just quicker to use brushes with color or exposure adjustments and sort it out ad hoc. That's still not a brilliant strategy, but it works (enough) for now, I'm quicker at it, and I haven't had any issues with customers, knock on wood. I will be trying an IR cut filter though, so I'll report back if it returns a good result \ud83d\udc4d P/S I half suspect Leica likes the thin cover glass and consequent IR pollution for nice skin tones and for a certain kind of monochrome look. I have an M9 for personal use (photographing my family), as well as my two S bodies for work.... and of the many cameras I've ever used, the S2, the S typ006 and M9, those three in particular, do skin tones very nicely.

I will take a look, much appreciated. Just to underline it here: my post was not made because I am scared of cleaning a digital sensor. I'm making sure that swab size was not as important as the internet would like you to think it is, and that no-one has had any issues with doing this over time, since Leica, as we know better than most, does not have a great track record on sensor cover-glass QA. I'm not shy about equipment maintenance either -- quite the opposite since these are my work tools, I keep a maintenance schedule going on my equipment and stick to it -- but I am cautious with expensive stuff and not afraid to ask questions and make sure. As you say, and I imagined, I'll be fine with a 135 (24mm) swab---thanks again to you and the group for confirming this. I don't want to get into a debate so I'm not sure if I should mention the following, but since we are among friends: I have definitely heard of lens coatings being damaged by regular lens cleaning fluids. I used Nikon before Leica, and was told directly by a Nikon service engineer that lens cleaning fluids can degrade lens coatings, and to stay off wet-cleans as much as possible (wet cleans as a last resort). The dust on a front element may look bad but it does not show up in the photos -- I think Roger Cicala showed that you need to basically draw on an element with a marker pen to get something to show up -- but this guy assured me that doing wet cleans (with lens cleaner) over time would degrade lens coats. I had no reason to doubt him. And I follow that advice to this day: I don't mess about with coated optical glass unless there is a solid reason to. I have a few S lenses, I think I've wet cleaned my S70's (I have two, one for backup) a grand total of three times in four years, and zero wet cleans for all the others (S120 Makro, S-K 120 T/S, S35 Summarit)---a few lens-pen passes on them, maybe. I can't even recall. Just blower a lot, and take sensible care with them. Never had any issues. They all look super clean. And for 2) I would not have assumed sensor cover glass gets the same coat as lens elements do. So that's interesting to hear. Where did you learn that jaapv? No cross-examining intended, just curious. I'm not an expert, that's the problem, but yea, I wouldn't have thought to make that assumption. So, you learn something everyday \ud83d\udc4d Thanks again. Have a good one jaapv. Cheers. Tom The cover glass of sensors is not that fragile at all. There is a (probably true) story of a Leica rep demonstrating this on a DMR. He pulled out a handkerchief, moistened it with his breath and cleaned a DMR sensor, just to demonstrate. The main cause of sensor damage when cleaning is to drag a sharp piece of grit, like a small sand grain, across the sensor. This can be avoided by blowing with a blower bulb before cleaning. I use the Green Clean vacuum cleaner for the purpose when at home. Another cause of grief, I found, is using old fluid in a plastic bottle. The plasticizers can get leached out. I found out the hard way with a five year old bottle of Eclipse. It took me at least ten passes with Isopropyl Alcohol 99% under a surgical microscope to get the gunk off. . Nowadays I rarely wet clean, (using Smear Away by Visible Dust), only to remove the inevitable haze. I use the Eyelead Sensor Stick for Sony. The trick, for peace of mind, is to wobble it when removing, not pull. I find it even removes most of the greasy stuff. At any rate, most sticky dust on sensors is pollen. One hair-raising experience was a rather unique photo opportunity I had observing Wild Dogs in a tropical downpour when I had no sensor cleaning gear with me. I had to wipe the condensation off my CL's sensor using the tail of my T-shirt and Kleenex tissues.

Apparently for technical reasons, this is not possible but they may look again at some future date (Porker squadron fuelled and ready for take off \ud83d\ude00). In that case I would suggest making the Leica C Image Shuttle app available again on the Apple app store internationally, so those of us still using C112 cameras, have an option for remote control and image access from iOS devices.

Ok. It seems that for some of us, even when our beloved brand makes a mistake, they don't. Sorry, I cannot agree with it. The 28 mark in the 50 (that I sincerely doubt that all the adapters wrongly marked with \"28\" were done between 1954 and 1957), is a clear mistake. There should be no \"28\" mark on it and from 1971 there should be that \"28mm\" mark in the 90 adapter. The \"21mm\" mark has no reason at all (or do we have here the same reason of \"cleaner finder\"?). The wiki is simply wrong in its 35/50 statement. Not mentioning the 28mm in the 90 adapter is also an error. What's the problem of simply pointing and assuming errors? I'm absolutely amazed. I could make rather a long list of mistakes I think Leica has made! And certainly if you were selling an adapter like this today, it would be misleading to put '28' on an adapter that won't bring up a 28 frameline on the many cameras that have it. But I think this was deliberate back in the day (I doubt they were selling many in the 80s, however they were engraved). Take a look at the IRZOO image. It says 'M3 28-50' (or 'M3 21-50'), but on the other side just 'M2 50'. On the M2, no frameline is fixed, so with any adapter you'll see one of the three (take your pick) but no more. On the M3, with any adapter except the 50, you'll see two framelines, neither correct. So with this camera, the 50 is the least bad option. Anything else is worse than the M2. I have an M6 and the set of three adapters, and if I ever buy a 28mm LTM lens, I'll obviously use the 90 adapter (unless someone can think of a reason why I shouldn't). But if instead I wanted to use that 28 on an M3, I'd use the 50 adapter. Wouldn't you?

Thanks Nigel. It still has not hit 'The Sun on which the Empire never sets', thank God. The idea of putting out this story was and still is to find the families of the people in the photos and to give them some nice black and white prints. Up to the beginning of last week the original story on Macfilos had about 4,000 reads. Then my friend and fellow Leica Society member, Phil Coomes, BBC Picture Editor, put it on the on the BBC website and as of tonight my article has had almost 37,000 reads in its original format . The BBC version had 2 million hits at the end of last week and that has probably reached 4 or 5 million as it has since been in/on The New York Times, The Irish Times, The London Times, The Mail Online, CNN Travel, Swiss, German and Italian newspapers, including Corriere della Sera, Swiss TV and many others. We still have no clear leads, although many suggestions have been made. The story has turned up some interesting issues about 'photographic archaeology', but my goal still remains the same. I might add that it has raised the profile of Leica among many people who may not have previously been familiar with the brand. 21 hours ago, tomtschi said: That picture was surely taken from the Hotel Schweizerhof, and the angle suggests it was just about the height of the Hotel sign.

Getting back to more practical issues, I believe that the triple notice board probably contained maps of Zurich on both sides in the 3 official Swiss languages, German, French and Italian.

Nearly 60 years ago my dad developed black and white film in our basement, and his camera was an inexpensive rangefinder. I remember how much I enjoyed looking through the finder and seeing the world in a different way, but I was too young to understand what made it unique. As our family grew he gave up photography, having to spend time on earning a living to support the family, but I never forgot that camera. Years later I bought a simple Nikon film camera, gradually moving up the model ladder to the F cameras, ultimately owning a F6 and several lenses. While that camera is technically wonderful, it wasn't as much fun or as easy to use as my dad's old rangefinder. I eventually found that I wasn't shooting much at all, and essentially gave up for several years. As retirement neared I started to rethink the camera world and my lack of participation and got a Nikon F5 again. It was a good camera, but film was getting harder to process and find, and the lure of digital firmly grabbed me. I moved to digital cameras, moving up from a D3500 to D5500 (which I still have along with the two common zooms), but as much as I tried to love the cameras I didn't take many more pictures than I did with the F6. The cameras are technical marvels, but overly complicated (at least to me) with menu after menu and lots of non-intuitive steps to get the most out of the camera. The camera also feels \"plasticy\" even though it's built of higher grade materials. Enter Leica - I never owned one but in short order went from a M7 to M9 and M-A, with a 50mm Summicron (digitally coded) and a 35mm Summarit (new design, also coded). Things were far easier to use, but I didn't get the shots I wanted. My eyes have lots of astigmatism, and I also use multi-focal length lenses. The combination makes it hard to get clear focus, even when adjusting the diopter. The biggest change is the lack of clarity, forcing me to preset the depth of field to preset focus and essentially use the camera as a point and shoot. That's not been very rewarding since to be safe I rarely shoot wide open, negating a key feature of Leica glass. In a moment of frustration I sold everything, a move I deeply regret. As the frustration with the D5500 menus continued to stop me from enjoying my camera along with continued inability to get the look I want (Photoshop is not an easy to master program - it's even more frustrating than using the D5500), I found a site hosted by Ming Thein, and I enjoy his approach to photography and \"cinematic\" processing format. That led me to buy a Hasselblad 503CW and I loved looking at the large negatives. I even enrolled in the local community college to learn how to develop and print. That experiment lasted for a few months, but eventually the demand for the darkroom led to long wait times and I again grew frustrated selling the camera - mistake number 2. Eventually I bought a Leica Q titanium from Ken Hansen - a wonderful gentleman who took the time to help educate me. We are all poorer after his passing. While I love the build/quality/feel/etc of the Q the 28mm focal length is very challenging for composition, at least for me. Facial distortion requires getting pretty close to the subject, not an easy task for casual shooting, and making candids especially difficult. Unlike my other mistakes I still have the Q, but I'm not sure what to do now. So, no surprise, I bought a different system - Nikon Z6 with the F4 zoom kit lens. It's a very nice camera, is praised by nearly everyone, and does indeed have the ability to produce great images. Except, again no surprise, I'm back in \"menu-land\" with many buttons able to be programmed and have dual functions. I get even more confused as the capabilities of the modern cameras overwhelm me with learning curves, odd settings and other things that make photography a mental exercise instead of a composition/vision exploration. I went to my local camera store (a very good shop with a knowledgable owner) and asked his opinion. He suggested a SL/SL2, either new or used, allowing for autofocus and the ability to capture anything from grandchildren to landscape. I was tempted, but the lenses are enormous and quite pricey. The system didn't seem to offer much more than the Z6, and I just tried it in the store. He then suggested Fuji X cameras - and I remember having the EX-1 with a kit zoom and a prime, but as much as I liked the size I found the colors a bit odd and the unusual sensor images hard to process in Photoshop. Clearly things have changed, but I never fell in love with the camera, and gave it to my daughter who uses it for her family shots. As I think about what I'd like to shoot it comes down to landscape (more to document where I've been, but I'd like to learn the proper use of filters etc.), people (both family and others), and I prefer candid non-posed images. That leads me to the of lighting (fill flash isn't a strong point on a Leica) and carrying lots of gear. All of this led me to the Q in the first place, but unless I can master the 28mm (actually closer to 24mm) perspective I expect I'll continue to struggle. I'd like to settle into one camera/system. I've shot mostly 35/50mm perspective for most of my life, with the 50 accounting for 75% of all shots (my first instructor insisted that I use a 50 for a year until I learned it well - good advice, but my composition hasn't progressed very much). The Q seems to be the choice, but the 28mm perspective has me struggling to compose and capture what I'd like. The Z6 offers a lot - ability to capture grandchildren in candids, extend my reach with primes/zooms/adaptors, and the 24MP size is fine for my needs. The issue is the \"buttons\" - lots and lots of them and I have spent lots of timing trying to learn them without much success. The D5500 is the obvious \"do it all\" camera, but it's unrewarding to shoot and haptics matter, at least to me. The new M10 is a nice camera, but my vision is not great and the glasses I wear make it even more challenging to get consistent focus. There's also the cost - a full kit would finance a year of college for one grandson. So, the question is: \"What do you suggest I do?\" I want one system, prefer quality and haptics, but also want to capture what I see in my mind with consistent results.

Which photograph is better, a good image with an M9 or an average image with an M10-R? First Paragraph Answer: I agree the point can be made against all digital cameras.

I have found it quite useful to set up smart collections based on star rating and then rate each picture 1-5 stars. It's the quickest an most efficient procedure I have found and is easy to do as you import. It's really the 5 stars I'm interested in and you feel it as soon as you look at the picture. But I find it easier to then review older photos that I've pre-rated. I also have smart collections set up for camera and lens metadata as I find it sometimes easy to remember which lens I was using when recalling photos. Finding the best is literally like looking for a needle in a haystack. Then of course sorting those into categories and sets is another thing entirely but having a good idea of rating helps I find. It's the reviewing of rejects, 1-2 ratings, that is really quite tedious and as you say you have to be so careful as I have found enough in there that shouldn't have been to be a concern and frustration. That is a great point about offloading the older photos of then younger people. Good idea! It's the historic rediscoveries I fund fascinating. We see things differently as we change and I have photos from 15 years ago that I marked as quite ordinary as now some of my favourites.

Thanks LocalHero, I agree a website is wonderful to have and the thought of being able to publish straight from Lightroom would be a major plus. Thanks, I will look into that. Your website looks really wonderful\u2014some great work on there! Much of my quandary is purely for displaying photos in my house so prints, books and digital via monitor and also discovering out how I want to do it. Your print system sounds ideal and good that you can swap things out easily. Something I will consider too.

I mean, we've got a common language (sort of), good(ish) foreign relations and a mail and cargo exchange system not entirely dependent upon bribery and/or subject to routine grand theft. Ah -- BUT, there is still bureaucracy to contend with and herein lies the rub. I (fairly) recently sent an M2 off to the fabled Alan Starkie at Cameraworks-UK for some viewfinder service. On his excellent website, Alan has posted a clear warning. If possible, he says, do NOT employ the National Postal Service (i.e., USPS) to ship your goods to him. Use UPS or FedEx instead. He explains that the UK mail reception and courier service for parcels is an outfit called, aptly, Parcelforce Worldwide. Parcelforce, apparently, is allied to the Royal Mail which sounds like a good thing. BUT -- and Alan is clear about this in his warning -- Parcelforce routinely treats all incoming items as duty-eligible imported products, including clearly labeled items sent for repair, such as my camera. Accordingly, Parcelforce burdens the recipient -- Alan in this case -- with a goodly amount of paperwork to be completed and returned attesting to the fact that this incoming shipment, indeed, is not subject to import duties. Then, and only then, will the shipment be delivered. So, how long does this process take? Frankly, I don't know. I shipped my camera by USPS on the 22nd of June. It arrived in the UK to be processed by customs on the 24th. According to USPS tracking, it's still in the hands of Parcelforce through NO fault of Alan's. That's two weeks so far with no resolution in sight. I'm frustrated, of course, and I wouldn't blame Alan for wanting to take a ball peen hammer to my M2 in retaliation for the trouble Parcelforce and I have caused him. As I said, Alan warned this could happen. So, why didn't I heed his advice? Well, FedEx recently long delayed a couple of shipments I made (we'll blame \"the plague\" for that) but completely lost another. UPS utterly destroyed another very carefully packed overseas shipment. So, I said to myself, I'll use the good old post office. They've been a little slow from time to time, but they've never lost or trashed anything. Besides, how much trouble can it really be on the other end? Now I know.

If I missed it, please point me in the right direction. Thanks to everyone in advance for your comments. In years past I shot Hasselblad square negatives and printed black and white 8\"x8\" (my standard viewing size) or 16\"x16\" images (rarely used) - cropping wasn't an issue. I used 35mm film as well, but usually defaulted to 4x6 prints to keep the original aspect ratio. At the 35mm size lens resolution and film sensitivity were both somewhat limited, and although I enjoyed using a rangefinder camera, I typically got to see all the resolution that the combination of film/lens quality could provide. On the larger 2.25\" square negatives of medium format images, I didn't even care if I printed the images - the contact prints were spectacular and looking at them was a joy. Choosing between print and slide film was my biggest challenge - do I want the immediacy and portability of film, or the dramatic look of a projected negative? And ever since switching to digital imaging I've been confused. Please help me understand digital resolution versus actual photo resolution, and help me gain a framework (pun intended) as to how to view the digital world compared to the days of film. I own a Lecia Q and Nikon Z6, and for my needs the resolution they offer seems to exceed what I can actually view in an media. Let me try to explain more fully - and I'd appreciate any corrections of my lack of understanding. I typically view images from my digital cameras on a 27\" iMac Retina display - that's the largest high resolution screen I have for any Digital images. From that perspective and pixel peeking with LR/PS I can see differences, but the question is do they matter. That is what I struggle to understand. The issue is that I don't really have the ability to see the full resolution of the images I'm making in camera. The 27\" Retina display is roughly 216 DPI resolution. The greatest resolution screen currently available is the Apple 12 Mini at 476 DPI or the Samsung Galaxy S7 at 577 DPI. These screens are tiny in comparison to the 27\" retina, and so I wonder whether I'll ever be able to capture the full quality of any digital images I make. Furthermore, most Digital screens have calibration issues and color matching is difficult when viewing images on different screens of varying accuracy. I rarely print actual photos, but when I do they tend to be cropped since a 24x36mm sensor doesn't easily transfer to standard photo size prints, and the only standard size print that matches that aspect ratio is a 4X6\" size - hardly large enough to notice fine detail. The closest standard size photo to match my sensor is a 11x16 with an aspect ratio of 1.45:1. So in addition to losing some of my original composition to cropping, I also have to try to match the 300DPI image quality actual printed photos. To print that image at 300 DPI requires a resolution of roughly 16MB. (11\"*300 dpi) * (16\"*300 dpi) = 15.84MB. From that perspective my original Q and Nikon Z6 both seem to be all the resolution I need for the print sizes I will likely make (even if that is a rare event). From my limited understanding I fail to see how higher pixel count sensors result in an actually superior printed image made from a 24x36mm sensor. What am I missing? Adding to these questions the newer medium format sensors are closer to 4.5x6mm format film, not the former square standard of 6mm film. So cropping is required in this format as well, with the closest match likely 11x14. This creates the same misunderstanding of how the Hasselblad/Fuji 33X44 size sensors translate to actual improved printed photos. This seems to create similar issues to using a full frame sensor sized image, with the differences related to cropping a medium format image to a standard size print. So, please help me understand: (1) Given current screen technology, how do I see the full resolution that my sensor is creating (and does this become more limiting for higher resolution sensors); (2) since typical printed photo sizes don't match any full frame or medium format sensor (or for that matter old film negatives) how do you compose knowing that a printed image will force you to crop; (3) how do I resolve these discrepancies when trying to decide upon the ever larger sensor pixel resolution and actual printed photos; (4) - and to me the most important question - Given the increasing difficulty of printing large size photos on real photographic paper, at what point do theoretical improvements in modern digital cameras become unobtainable in real life viewing?", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/315150-help-me-understand-digital-resolutioncropping-versus-actual-photos/?tab=comments#comment-4080883", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "315150-help-me-understand-digital-resolutioncropping-versus-actual-photos", "result": true, "Selector": "i'm making", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": " i searched this forum for a discussion of this topic, but haven't found any. if i missed it, please point me in the right direction. thanks to everyone in advance for your comments. in years past i shot hasselblad square negatives and printed black and white 8\"x8\" (my standard viewing size) or 16\"x16\" images (rarely used) - cropping wasn't an issue. i used 35mm film as well, but usually defaulted to 4x6 prints to keep the original aspect ratio. at the 35mm size lens resolution and film sensitivity were both somewhat limited, and although i enjoyed using a rangefinder camera, i typically got to see all the resolution that the combination of film/lens quality could provide. on the larger 2.25\" square negatives of medium format images, i didn't even care if i printed the images - the contact prints were spectacular and looking at them was a joy. choosing between print and slide film was my biggest challenge - do i want the immediacy and portability of film, or the dramatic look of a projected negative? and ever since switching to digital imaging i've been confused. please help me understand digital resolution versus actual photo resolution, and help me gain a framework (pun intended) as to how to view the digital world compared to the days of film. i own a lecia q and nikon z6, and for my needs the resolution they offer seems to exceed what i can actually view in an media. let me try to explain more fully - and i'd appreciate any corrections of my lack of understanding. i typically view images from my digital cameras on a 27\" imac retina display - that's the largest high resolution screen i have for any digital images. from that perspective and pixel peeking with lr/ps i can see differences, but the question is do they matter. that is what i struggle to understand. the issue is that -----> i !!!  don't really have the ability to see the full resolution of the images -----> i !!!

The only thing that remains a bit implicit is the \u2018decisive moment\u2019: photography is often about that and you can forget that with LF, unless you start working like WeeGee the famous did. Intrepid is another channel. I bought a Chamonix 4x5 a few years ago, am happy with and enjoy working with it even with all the mistakes I made. Somehow LF is more forgiving for a few vignets, lightleaks etc. From my experience I can tell you this: - if I had to start over I\u2019d start with 8x10 and skip the 4x5 so-called learning stage (I worked with 4x5 30 years ago, so I know all that). 4x5 is too small for contacts and has little surplusvalue over 6x9 or 6x7 which is easy to do with some Fuji body. And this gives you the possibility of the decisive moment. Your series of Svalbard is great, is not very dependent on decisive moments but might have been possible on 6x7 somehow, but different. I\u2019d use 8x10 for stills and perhaps portraits only: tonal scale, special old lenses and composition are the main drives and perhaps wet plate in the end.

I read through that thread and I'm hoping this new thread will get more attention because I want to make a quick decision. I now use a V600 and Silverfast for 35mm B&W film, so far Ilford HP 5 or FP 4. I turn off unsharp mask, adjust for highlights and blacks, and then export at about 3200 PPI in tiff. I then import into Lightroom, play with the sliders and usually export for the internet at about 2mb. If I want prints I'll send 10mb files to Walgreens. Although I've not done this, if I want analog prints I'd send to a reputable shop. I believe I'm not getting enough detail/resolution so I'm strongly considering a scanner upgrade. I'll either use the V600 for quick review and then run the keepers through the new scanner, or I might give the V600 away to a college or high school. Right now I'm leaning towards an Epson V850 or a Plustek 8200. The Plustek 120 Pro is an option but I'd have to see the how the extra cost is justified. I sent a roll of HP 5 to Ilford USA for developing a month a go because I wanted sharp scans (didn't even ask for prints) and indicated I want large tiff files to work with.

To me HP 5 shots at box speed (using DDX and using the Massive Development suggested times) should be normally less contrasty than some other 400 ISO films.

I will try to address all the points you've raised: @Charles Morgan yes, that's actually solid advice - I won't chuck the film right away but hold off on shooting it and leave it for something not important. Good to know your results are stable. I will definitely reconsider buying film from Amazon Marketplace and go with a trusted supplier. @fotomas Good point on tolerances, I've now bought a SousVide-like temperature control unit and and a digital thermometer chucking my old analog one. I'll make sure to stay within .1 tolerances for develop/blix stages. @250swb Yes, that were my thoughts exactly - if the tolerances were way off, how comes of two rolls developed at the same time, one is alright but the other isn't. And indeed the darker results look quite extreme. The two shots were meant to represent two rolls shot back to back with the same settings and developed in the same chemistry. One of the rolls developed fine the other not so much. Both scanned with multi-exposure setting (multi-pass scan) to extract all the information possible. In addition I found that for the dense neg the infra-red dust removal function completely fails, which was interesting. @adan Wow, these are brilliant results recovering the ruined scan. I did scan it at the lowest possible contrast, as suggested, so perhaps I should give selective colour tool a go for some shots. I just can't imagine doing it for every frame of my 12 rolls. Also, I did hear back from the seller who said they've shot a roll from the same batch, developed it and the results were spot on. Just to add to the confusion.

Compared to user reviews of common Kodak and Ilford B&W films, I feel that the results I get from Montreal's commercial lab (where almost all films are sent by the photo shops) show more grain than I would expect. So I wonder if my films are being processed with the correct developer chemicals and process, as recommended by their manufacturers, or maybe all the B&W films are subjected to a general-purpose developer and process, so the results are not optimal. I understand that grain appearance is all relative and subjective, but I would like to obtain the best results from each film I use. What questions could I ask the lab (assuming I can reach the developer technician) to find out what they do, and how to get optimal results? Or, to try for optimal results, how difficult is it to develop my own B&W films at home? Last month (using a 1933 Leica III, with a 1953 Elmar 5cm in excellent condition) I shot a roll of Ilford HP5 Plus 400 for the first time. To me the grain appears more visible than I expected compared to user reviews of that film. Here is an example picture (reduced to the Forum size limit), centre-cropped about 75%, shot at f5.6 and 1/500 sec. Processing B&W film is easy and fast, and lets you see how the different types of developers affect grain and perception of sharpness. On eBay try to find a Nikor tank for a single 35mm reel - it is the smallest practical tank, and uses only 250 ml to fill. (I can load, process and hang to dry a single roll in about 20 minutes, using only about 2 liters of filtered water for everything including wash.) I'd suggest getting a Hewes 35mm reel, as it is easier to load than the old Nikor and cheaper reels. (I used Nikor for almost 50 years before finding Hewes.) The stainless reels load from the center out (bowing the film slightly to fit between the spirals, hook onto the center and wind outward while your fingers keep a slight bow to the film.) Plastic reels load from the outside in. That's faster to learn, but slower than stainless once you master it. The plastic tanks are much larger, and generally need more liquid to fill. Although I converted my guest bath for darkroom use (with a slip-in blackout panel for the window) I now always use a large changing bag to load film into the tank and process film with the lights on. I only convert to DARK when I want to make a wet print with the enlarger. Wet printing is much more complex than film developing, so I normally scan to computer unless I find an exceptional image. I'm out of practice for wet printing, but was fast and proficient when it was the only choice, and I had a dedicated darkroom set up for printing! Now I guess I'm too lazy. HP5 can be quite grainy depending on developer and technique. If you use Rodinal (very convenient and versatile) the results look sharp, but with emphasized grain. For HP5 Ilford DD-X gives much finer grain and is what I usually use for HP5. Both of these are liquids that you dilute for each use and discard. For fine grain films (PanF is my favorite) I prefer Rodinal with PanF for its tonal range and apparent sharpness. (Better defined grain make the image appear sharper.) I find Ilford films (PanF, FP4, HP5) generally easier to load onto reels and scan than current Kodak, as they lay flatter and feel a bit stiffer. However, Fomapan 100 & 400 lay even flatter for scanning and seem to load easiest. I only discovered Foma in the last year, and now use it most. It's also cheaper for my retirement budget. If you are used to having the lab scan, you'll find it hard to achieve equivalent sharpness with most home scanners, but results should be fine for viewing on computer screens. Like making wet prints with an enlarger, scanning can be an art form to really tweak results, but I'm usually satisfied with the default scans from my Epson 850.

I then make a test strip to fine tune the grade 0 exposure, which nails down the highlights. I use the Analyzer\u2019s test strip function, which gives very reliable results. I then use the Analyzer set to Gr 5 and estimate the Gr 5 exposure for a shadow area. I then make a Gr 5 test strip based on my estimate of a shadow time. First I use the Gr 0 filter and time determined by the first test strip as a base exposure (the Gr 0 exposure adds a little to the shadows), and then using the Gr 5 filter and add Gr 5 light to make a test strip, which tells me the exposure time for the Gr 5 filter and shadows. I hope this is clear-ish. RH designs says \u201cno more test strips\u201d \u2013 I think that is wrong. The unit is excellent, but it does not give a wall-worthy print on its own. It does give excellent ball park times and the f-stop timer function is a god-send. Fine tuning is required \u2013 by you. Any questions \u2013 I am happy to try and help (or add more confusion). Hi Micheal, Thank you for that post. For last 3 weeks I have been trying to figure out which of RH Desings products I should buy. First I was sure that I should buy Stopclock but later after so many positive opinions about Analyser I change my mind and decided to focus on it.

Building on what I learned from the first pack, I: - Printed photographs of people, landscape and nature, avoiding buildings and manmade objects. - Looked at how well borderless printing works. - Looked at how well the thin papers stood up to dense coloured images (lots of ink), as well as sparse images with lots of light background. - Printed on both sides of the Inbe Thin paper; although not marked on the pack as suitable for double sided, I'd seen remarks online that the Inbe paper was designed for double sided. Further conclusions: - Borderless printing presented no problems (I didn't expect any, but worth checking). - The Murakumo Kozo Select thin papers held ink well (dark blue image of man in the centre, and B&W girl singing top right corner) showed the image on the reverse, but with little obvious lateral seepage. The Kozo Thin papers showed even less (landscape with two rocky islands, centre left, two dancing couples, top centre). - The Inbe Thin White, which I printed double sided with dense coloured images (girl in the red jacket, centre right) showed no obvious sign of the images on the respective reverses. Common sense says this needs further examination, but if it remains the case, then this looks like a good paper for photobooks. - The double layered papers remain challenging, both to peel and mount. My experience from the first batch was repeated: the Mitsumata White Double Layered (landscape of Helvellyn, bottom left) was fairly easy to separate with care. The Kozo Double Layered is tricky and easy to tear as you start to peel, and remains curled (lovers in dark red, bottom right). I understand these papers are designed to be made into Japanese hanging scrolls. - I tried two different image types with the Unryu paper (the one with the waferboard-like surface texture). A borderless print of a wildflower garden (top right): the paper pattern was lost entirely; I can see no benefit to this paper for such an all-over image. The clunky vignette of pink plants (lower left): the paper adds something here because the texture is visible in the un-inked or light colour parts. This is not really the sort of photography I do, but I can see a benefit to the paper here. - Generalising from the foregoing conclusion, all these papers show themselves at their best where the texture of the paper can be seen. I would be inclined to print dense colour images with a large border, or use these papers for images where there are plenty of light areas. - I don't think I have examined B&W landscapes particularly well here, though I included several (all given a similar high key, high contrast treatment). It's not a type of photography I do much of and I doubt that I am particularly good at processing them for printing on western paper, let alone these Japanese papers. So will I buy some more? Probably! I want to make some photobooks, so the Inbe Thin papers are attractive. The Bizan (handmade) papers are stunning, and expensive. They would make great presents, for holding.

I have taken my photography seriously only in the last year, and it's time to get into printing as well. Ideally (if exists), I would like to invest in a printer that would last for years, with the following characteristics: - The best possible image quality (also In terms of durability), as I am planning to sell prints - Mostly, I would use the print to print a relatively high number of photos in smaller format, for review purposes, but still the highest quality possible - Within an budget of about 1200 GBP (of course, I would like to spend much less) I have a few basic questions: Would a printer like Epsom SC-P800 support papers like HP Premium Satin? The fact that the SC-P800 is an A2 printer means that it can easily print any smaller format, right? Many thanks in advance! Take a look at the Fotospeed website for your SC-P800 printer. I use Fotospeed Inkflow inks and Fotospeed papers, currently Platinum Etching 285 for colour and black and white prints, Platinum Baryta 300 for colour prints and Legacy Gloss 325 for back and white prints. There are many more papers in the range and the best way to decide for yourself is to experiment with their sample packs. Fotospeed Inkflow employs refillable cartridges and it is much cheaper to feed your printer this way than using genuine Epson inks (this is where all printer manufacturers make their money). Fotospeed will provide you with FREE CUSTOM PROFILES with their inks and papers. Simply download the profiling pack from the Fotospeed website, print the chart and send it to Fotospeed who will email your custom profile(s) back to you. From my experience custom profiles are returned within 48 hours. They will also provide you with custom profiles for non-Fotospeed inks and papers but there is a cost for this. Also take a look at the Marrutt website for your SC-P800 and their Continuous Ink System and refillable cartridges. Excellent support and their papers and inksets are probably just as good as Fotospeed. I was for several years a beta-tester for Epson's ProPortrait printing system (as the 1st UK PropPortrait installation) which was only available to professional photographers. My experience is that you will see no difference in print quality between Fotospeed Inkflow and genuine Epson inks. Many of my professional colleagues also use Fotospeed Inks and papers. I would urge you to take a close look at Fotospeed Inflow before buying a SC-P800. Disclaimer: I have no connection with Fotospeed other than being a very satisfied customer with their products, service and support. Whichever way you go, good luck and well-done on deciding to print your work!

Just a thought: now that you have ordered a P800, it might be prudent to stick with Epson inks and papers to protect your warranty whilst you find your feet rather than go straight into CIS or refillable cartridges from a third party supplier such as Fotospeed or Marrutt, which will likely void your warranty if you subsequently have problems with the printer. Personally, from long experience I would always buy the printer together with CIS or refillables from the same ink system supplier, where the supplier will provide their own warranty. Buying a new printer from one source may well be a false economy if you load it with third party inks from another source and run into problems from the outset.

So here are the unadjusted RAW and adjusted JPEG files. Neither can illustrate '' because light and colour reality at 27m depth are both low (1s at f/14 handheld + flash is as far as I could go) and there are only reds due to the flash. The exposure is at the high side, but all highlights are retained, because of the background which would otherwise be absolute black and whilst I can pull back the highlights, noise kicks in in the shadows if they are brightened too much. For anyone who doesn't scuba dive in murky, dark, cold (12C) water, then it may not also be apparent that decision making is marginally blurring at this depth and there is a very finite limit on the time available so precision is not always as easy as above water. But I digress. Sony A7II with 20/1.8 FE lens. Its primarily a scientific shot and the adjusted shows how I intended the image to look. --img--  --img--  Your usual superb standard, Paul. I suppose the question about which actually represents reality is answered by what you saw when you were there yourself. However that was the reality you saw and which you attempted to capture. If I was there (unlikely!) I might see a different 'reality'. No camera or film that I have used can capture exactly the 'reality' that I can see. When I take a photo I often make a little mental note to self along the lines of 'I know what I will do with that one'. It is all a bit circular really, but it reflects what what the photographer wants to see and show. As for technical points about the output abilities of different cameras and films I usually don't pay them much attention once I am in a shooting situation.

I\u2019m generally pleased with the scans from my lab, which are JPEGs (2048\u00d73072 pixel scans per the lab), so I only make minor tweaks for the keepers in Lightroom (which I know is a topic on its own). Anyone with experience using a similar workflow? I\u2019m particularly interested in the following: 1. Do you still run the JPEG (or TIFF) through Silver Efex Pro? I\u2019ve not used SEP yet even for my digital workflow, but wonder if the zone system info is at all helpful/effective in translating to print. 2.

Additionally you will need some software because neither Photoshop or Lightroom can 'invert' a colour negative or B&W image correctly.

So - intro out of the way ... a bit about me and photography now. I've added film to my repertoire, personally and a bit professionally, for the last ~ 2 years. I shoot with a Leica M6 (35mm Summicron v3 and 50mm Summicron Collapsible), a Rolleiflex 2.8C, a Contax T3, a Shen Hao 4x5, an Olympus Pen EES2 and a handful of others. Here are some film images I've made in that Leica M Monochrom forum intro: Anyway - I'm comparing the various Leica M digital bodies for what I'd like to get to see what will fit my preferences. Currently, I shoot with Fuji gear, digitally - a pair of XT3s and an X100V. I love my Fuji gear, but I also really love the experience of shooting with my M6 (rangefinder, manual focus, etc.) and I adore the character out of my 50mm Summicron Collapsible. I'd be shooting a digital M mostly personally, but I'd probably also start to incorporate it into my professional work and bring it to weddings for parts of the day and bring it for more documentary portrait work at my portrait sessions. Thus far, I've been between an M240, the MP240 and the M246 Monochrom. But tonight I came across the M262 and I think I'm sort of in love. No EVF - no problem, I wouldn't use it anyway. No video - perfect, I'd rather have less features in a camera. I'd never use video on a Leica M digital body. Simpler menu system from what I can read. No problem! I'd rather have less features/functions/buttons - more akin to shooting with my M6. Smaller buffer - no problem, I won't be spraying-and-praying anyway. Is there anything else I'm not seeing?

From the other thread you started (also in this 240/262 forum): I would skip the 262 for lack of live view (even if you do not care about EVF or film). Really great to be able to turn it on the the times you really need it. Of the cameras you list above, I would go for the M-P version. It is the best of all worlds of all the cameras in this generation. I love the 100% increased 2GB buffer (makes a big difference when you take several pictures, even if no M cameras are speed monsters) also the red fram line option (really great when I shoot in the dark and do not want to destroy my night vision), which I just now learned from another thread, is unfortunately no option in the 262.

I got my M246 and film M-P at the end of 2018, and used them sporadically into the first half of 2019. Now with the M10M announcement, I had not much interest originally. I've acquired a full Leica S system late in 2019 and had enough things to play with and compare, such as S 007 to X1Dii. However, something about sheltering in place caused me to pick up the M246, and I've made thousands of shots with it in March and April, and also dozens of B&W videos. I even got the Leica Mikrophon adapter for M246, to record stereo. And after reading many reviews, I'm getting the M10M, hopefully next week. I'm not letting the M246 go as the B+W video might never come back and it's the only rangefinder with video I got (Edition 60 eschewed it). I can also compare them and do two-body, two-lens shooting. I'm usually carrying a color M, M60 or M10, when I take the M246 with me, so now it would be three Ms, no big deal compared to say S with an X1D and a few of their lenses. There's a lot to say for B+W in these polarized times. It has drama and urgency, going back to elemental meaning. It's interesting how the times make some technology urgent and relevant.

It is your journey. Pete Thanks Pete, I purchased my first \u201creal camera\u201d when my first son was born almost 2 years ago. Since then the photography bug turned from an interest to a hobby to now a passion. I have also enjoyed the tech and physical side of it. For me, I simply enjoy shooting window finders for the connection to the reality in front of me, the method, and the feel of history in the technique (m10 and xpro). When I need AF for family events and require accuracy and consistency (while participating in the event as well), I used to pick up an A7r(x), but now an SL2. You are right though, our journeys are all our own. It is clear to me that if you participate in a forum that is dedicated to discussing a particular camera or lens, you must also find the gear and tech important. And, if you decide to spend the time (which of course is limited for all of us to shoot) on these forums instead of out shooting, what is really more important? The gear or the photos?

It is really hard to beat how film translates light into tonality. I think the natural rolloff that you get from the photochemical processes tend to smooth out most of the extremes in tonality, in a way that is closer to the way that people see. I can make beautiful black and white conversions from modern digital cameras, but they are not AS beautiful as big film. There is a lightness to the tonality, a life. I know this kind of statement drives people who prefer digital mad, as it is difficult to quantify and difficult to \"prove\". I don't think it is a matter of proof. But I can say that as a professional printer for more than the past decade or so, as one who is very at home with a whole host of digital cameras, inkjet printers, scanners as well as the black and white and color darkrooms, that I have not seen more beautiful images than those made by talented photographers on 4x5 and 8x10. That most definitely includes Phase One right up to 150mp. Of course, this is said with the understanding that film is inconvenient, impractical and expensive in those formats, and that in most cases it is translated to digital at some point anyway (which does not cause it to lose its charm). But if you put a gun to my head as to one camera to use the rest of my life, no exceptions, it would be my Ebony 4x5.

It must be absolutely pattern-less. E: Some note about the acrylic film holder: Cleaning the acrylic or glass surface is a nightmare. You don't want to do that on the inner surface. Outer surface is OK since the acrylic is so thick and far out of focus. To keep the inner surface clean, never scratch it and never expose it to air or touch it, except changing the film. Always wear proper gloves. I made s spacer about the thickness of the film by taping a electrical tape on the edge of the inner surface. This way, the center area of the inner surface is more free from scratching each other. I actually also made a spacer on the outer surface by the same thing. This is so to prevent the outer surface scratched by the light panel. though it is less necessary. ***** By the way, on the digitizing exposure, color reversal, white balance, and color adjust. I found the camera auto exposure is no good for color negatives. My practice is to calibrate the exposure on the first picture of that film type. Method 1: Take a shot, check the exposure histogram. If it is not centered, redo it by changing the exposure (shutter speed). Method 2: Take a shot, convert to positive, check the exposure histogram. If it is not centered, redo it by changing the exposure (shutter speed). Depends on the film, you should find one of the two methods more favorable. Once you are happy, stick to that exposure value. In my case, the raw negative exposure usually looks very thin. After the reversal, I find just a simple white balance by clicking on the grey or white area (a white clothes or a paved road, for example) does an excellent job.

From now on I am going to stick to Ektar, Portra, Ulltramax and Ektachrome for colour. Anything else is a false economy, home or professional processed.

Learn to use your bulk film loader in a changing bag or a darkroom. It's actually easy and is my preferred method now.

Holding the queue up whilst you try to find the type of scanner and check it against your list isn't going to win you many friends amongst security personnel.

There is no adverse effect on any of my films. Of course, these were all older type scanners.

I'm still on perpetual version (6.14 on Windows). It does everything I need and still supports all the cameras I have. I've been with LR since the Beta test versions, so alo a long history with the tool Even when I get an \"unsupported\" camera in the future I can get the latest and free DNG converter. My old LR perpetual licence will still open these newer camera DNG files. Just one extra step in the workflow. I know I'm foregoing some improvements in later Lightroom CC classic versions but so be it. For me it's not so much the ongoing subscription money (that's not significantly different from buying perpetual upgrades in the past), it's the \"end play\" when you stop the subscription that bothers me. When you stop the subscription the develop module gets disabled so basically you're stuck with the library and rudimentary library develop tools. However you can still import new files into the library. What I think would be a much more sensible \"end play\" is keep the develop module active (so you can still work on all the files you took/imported during the subscription) but disable the import module so no new files can be added after stopping the subscription. In case that would happen I would be seriously considering the subscription, but until then it's a no go zone for me.
