It is very likely corrosion. Those must have been about the last ones of the old type... It should be under warranty by what came out back then, but obviously I cannot speak for Leica. Contact Andrea at CS and ask. So, I've been in contact with Leica CS regarding the corrosion on my M9 & Monochrom sensors which were replaced in 2015. When I wrote to them I said that I would assume that the replaced sensors would carry a 5 year warranty from 2015. Here's the reply I received this morning: \"We regret to learn that you have problems again with the sensors of both your Leica M9 and your Leica MM. Both cameras are older than 5 years, we charge a contribution of \u20ac1330 + VAT for affected cameras that are older than 5 years. The deciding factor is the age of the camera for which we allowed an additional 3 year good will period, not the age of the sensor. Included in this price for sensor replacement is a free general overhaul of your Leica M camera and a one year warranty on the same terms as for new products. This offer expresses our commitment to conserving the value of the camera. The general overhaul of the Leica M camera includes the following items: Cleaning and overhaul of the shutter cocking mechanisms Cleaning and maintenance/repair of the multifunction wheel Cleaning of the main switch and shutter speed dial Adjustment of the baseplate locking system Refurbishment of engravings Renewal of the protective film on the baseplate Maintenance/repair of viewfinder displays In addition to the chargeable repair, you have the option to take advantage of our attractive upgrade program to a M 240, M 262 or MM 246, M10/M10-P or Leica SL incl. M-Adapter. Please kindly fill out the repair form and the proforma invoice and send with the goods.\" Other than the corroded sensors, my cameras don't need any overhaul, that's all marketing BS. To say that I'm pissed off is an uderstatement! Leica's attitude is unconscionable. If I decide to go the repair route I'm in for \u20ac2, 660- plus 19% = \u20ac3, 165- If I decide to take advantage of their so-called \"attractive upgrade program\" I'm still going to have to part with money. All for something that is entirely due to their faulty supply chain and manufacturing process, and no fault of this consumer who in good faith purchased 2 \"high-end quality\" cameras.

As you say though it was VERY poor the way that they handled the issue - firstly denying it and then reneging on their stated policy of fixing it for free. I originally saw it as a non issue and something that would be fixed anyway so \"why bother\" Leica would sort it and stand by their customers. That's all I am upset about, the going back on their word and taking heed of the accountants who no doubt came up with some formula that said \"Yes there will be hassle and a loss of faith but there will be new customers buying future products so no lasting damage\". I always thought Leica were a company who above all else were concerned to make the very best and would always stand by their products.

Leica falls short on the long end - in all their systems. However, looking at vintage, I am convinced that the Vario-Elmar 105-280 R with converters will give better quality than the Canon albeit slightly shorter and Manual Focus. Thanks Jaap. I have both the Leica APO-Telyt R f4 280mm and the Leica 105-280mm R plus my old Carl Zeiss Apo T 300m f2.8 behemoth. They're all too cumbersome and heavy, I'm also quite a bit older from when I bought these lenses 20 or so years ago.... I picked up the Canon 400mm f5.6 L plus Canon MK3 1.4 x Tele Converter and the Sigma MC-21 adaptor this afternoon. The Canon lens weighs all of 1.2kg! Using my cats as models, the initial results are very pleasing.

I would propose this: Leica has tried to develop a 'flagship' brand. By that I mean they have tried to become the best of each type of camera. Sure, it was simpler when it was only 35mm film - and each successive body type had a different market and different user. If you look at the most reliable mechanically, you would probably come up with something like: Leica IIIC, Leica M3, Leica MP. Then there were the unique: Leica M2R, Leica MD and others. Finally there were some that were more affordable: Leica M2, M4 and M6. (don't critique me too much here - I did this off the cuff to show a point). So, today we have the Leica M series which is advertised as the most compact 35mm, full frame (and full frame film) body because of the rangefinder (mirrorless) and with the highest quality images in the smallest possible packages (i.e., small lenses with great image quality). Then, we have the SL market with mirrorless that has provided some new outstanding primes, small, same filter size and incredible images and focusing speed compared to other lenses. Leica opened up the mount and so there are others in the market, but probably some 'flagship' lenses at least. Finally, we have the S series which is clearly a 'flagship' in the medium format market. The image quality of the S has been incredible since the first model and the lenses have not only great optical quality, but also larger f/stops (smaller numbers) than the other manufacturers. Focus speed and motors were not the focus, (no pun intended) because the medium format was not geared towards sporting events and documentary work. Also, the S lenses have this central shutter concept which is perfect for studio lighting. While other brands have that too, Leica built it in their high quality lenses to ensure all medium format users might find the lenses they need. The Leica Q falls somewhere between the M and SL I think, but the other Leica models - Dlux, Clux, V, X, and to some extent the CL are branches into reasonable camera systems, but not nearly as competitive as other brands. In summary, I think we have 3 (maybe 4) 'flagship' models of cameras with Leica - all for different purposes, but stellar in their field. So, the M for documentary, travel, small size, the SL for fast autofocus and multiple lens attachments (M, S, Nikon, Canon) and the S with incredible medium format capabilities and brighter lenses to focus with (2, 2.5 and 2.8 apertures). That is why I believe the S3 will come and will be great when it does. Leica has typically delayed the S in order to fine tune the sensor output. The SL and the now seen M10-monochrom use very similar sensor size and pixel density. The S has the same density, but a larger size - but the S is known for images that need very little touchup to use, if exposed under proper lighting.

I hope they sort out whatever issues the camera may have and that we see it on the market soon. The longer it takes, the more compelling options show up on the scene, and consequently the harder case it is to make to pay as much as they will likely demand. I am still very interested in the camera, but I agree that Leica's policy of utter silence around their future plans is really not serving them well here. While I understand their idea that they have fleshed out the system enough for most needs, I think they miss how important little details can be in making people feel like a system is being supported. For example, even though there has not been a lens in years, if they had released something...anything in that time, it would feel less dire.

At the time of S introduction to the market, the 'cheap' option for the MF market is the Pentax 645D, and to be honest, their optics is nowhere near as capable as the S glass and Leica do have such appeal compare to PhaseOne in terms of IQ if you don't consider adapting those digital back to a tech cam. (Since P1 was just basically rebadging some mamiya 645 lens, the IQ is hit and miss). It was a good time for S I guess, you can even call it revolutionary. Somehow, they remain static for 10 years, and see what this lead them... (Static only compare to the market) Also, I don't think S should be considered or viewed like the M, M is a unique one of a kind experience that nobody else is doing. Hence it can afford to be 'out of sync'. S... on the other hand... is a MF, with SLR design, promising to deliver uncompromising IQ, and rugged reliability... quite a few product appear in the market with these quality and even small company like P1 manage to dig itself out from the hole with the XF and the new blue ring monster lens while some company like Hassy manage to dig itself back into the oblivion with their closed system digital back and the half ass X1D.

The software team has confirmed that for the time being, we will not be adding support via VueScan or any other third party application. Someone else has asked about making FlexColor open source so that end users can maintain and update it. But our team has confirmed that this isn't possible due to restrictions on some of the source code and the restructuring required. In addition to that, the source code is not useful for a 64 bit system because as you know, all the UI code is strongly tied to a 32 bit only framework. If anything changes with this, I will let you know. To which I replied: Quote Thanks for getting back to me. I can't imagine why the software team would say that. Essentially they are say the scanner is doomed and we won't let anyone rescue it. I wonder if they are familiar with the fable of \u00c6sop about the dog in the manger? Frankly it seems there is something rotten about this whole business. I have seen two monthly Hasselblad newsletters come out that still say nothing about the discontinuation of the Flextight line. It looks like a company trying to sell off remaining stock to unsuspecting customers, who will buy an expensive item with no idea it has been orphaned. It stinks. I suspect Victor Hasselblad would be disgusted. There is NO reason to prevent someone else making these scanners useable in the future. It won't cost Hasselblad a penny. Selling brand new scanners to customers who have not been told they are discontinued and the software is about to become useless will expose the company to lawsuits, and rightly so. This reeks of short-term bean-counters making decisions that may maximise profit for a quarter or two, but cause a huge loss of respect for the brand shortly after that. It makes me want to pick them up and shake them! I'm sorry you have to work for such idiots. By all means pass this e-mail on to everyone in the company so they may know how angry I am with them. At this point I may as well sell my X1 and manage as best I can with an old Nikon 9000 (also discontinued but still supported by VueScan and by Silverfast). It's a disgrace. Now let me add that I am in no way cross with you personally. You have been a great help to me and you deserve to work for a more honest company than Hasselbald seems to be at present. My leukemia is sliding into relapse and there will be some more chemo shortly. Currently laid up with shingles in the worst part of the body imaginable.

If they change their mind please tell me about it. I've gone out on a limb promising the author of VueScan all sorts of support from users if he gets the necessary engineering details and comes up with working software. It's not just current owners being let down, but all those buying new scanners with no idea that they are buying a discontinued product, and then again, anyone who might develop software to keep them functional. Pretty hard to defend against a lawsuit where the plaintiff's case is that \"You sold me a $25,000 scanner without telling me it was about to become useless.\" Maybe Hasselblad have no lawyers on staff.

As an example, this image is shot hand held with my old Sony \u03b1 700 and Leica Apo Telyt 280mm f4 at 1/250 ---img-- no stabilisation in either the lens or the camera. Yes. It looks like the Panasonic S1R is prone to some sort of shutter vibrations when using mechanical shutter. This is not the case with the Sony a9 camera. I have already done quite a bit of testing and found that on the S1R, image sharpness starts to get better above 1/50sec with a 400mm @ f4 on a tripod. The sharpness more or less will peak at 1/100sec and above. Beyond 1/100sec, sharpness is about on par with electronic shutter. This is quite a big difference from the Sony a9 where on the same setup, I can get sharp images even at 1/15sec. I am not sure why the S1R is behaving like this. You can get sharp images on adapted lenses up to about 100mm at very low shutter speeds (1sec) but above that focal length, things become worse off. If the cause is because of shutter vibration, then it should be consistent across all focal lengths. I hope it is not unique to my camera \ud83d\ude04 Anyway, my findings have already been reported to the local Panasonic office and my understanding is that this information will be given to Panasonic Japan for their consideration. I am keeping my fingers crossed that Panasonic will come up with a remedy.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/305981-images-from-panasonic-cameras-merged/page/13/?tab=comments#comment-3719100", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "305981-images-from-panasonic-cameras-merged", "result": false, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "i am keeping my fingers crossed that panasonic will come up with a -----> remedy !!! .", "sortedWord": "remedy", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 45968, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "dave.gt", "date": "2019-06-21 19:39:00", "content": "Actually, I enjoyed the video. Entertaining, and I do not read anything into commercial videos anyway.

Get real.:) It appears I am not alone when it comes to OVF, and that is cool. But I do have to wonder if Hasselblad forgot the charm of the V system is in the WLF.... but that is just me, I'm sure. Now, back to the Leica S. Simplicity has in the past been the hallmark of Leica cameras. The Leica S is so simple. Yet, other systems want to include every bell and whistle. Ok, fine, but Leica really does not need to follow everyone else and it doesn't. I like the S3 specs just like they are at 64mp. If I cannot make excellent images with the new S3.... then I guess the problem will be me and my opinion is just one from an outlier.
