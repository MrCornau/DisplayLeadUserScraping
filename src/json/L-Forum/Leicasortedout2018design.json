As my interest in photography grew and I became more acquainted with the masters of humanitarian documentary, the name came up again and again, which compounded the mystique. When I finally started thinking seriously about replacing my aging crop-frame Canon 350D, in 2009 there was a screaming hype online about the idea of a full frame digital Leica. I didn't want to go back to shooting film and didn't want to buy a crop frame camera, but there seemed to be a debate raging about whether a full frame M was even physically possible (this was before the advent of micro-lenses). When the M9 was released was star-struck and determined to get one, but it was way out of reach, financially. Months later, I became friends with a new guy at work who seemed to share every interest of mine, including photography. When the conversation finally came around to Leica and I talked about how I was desperate to try one he said, \"Oh, I have an M6. I'll lend it to you for a few months.\" Three months with the M6TTL and 50 Lux sealed the love affair, although with inconsistent results. I talked about it constantly at home, to my wife's chagrin \u2014 \"We can't afford a camera that costs thousands of dollars!\" \"I don't need to afford it!\" I said, \"I just need to find a way of getting one!\" I'd managed to barter my way into a custom bicycle in the past by exchanging design work for labor and figured there must be a similar avenue with the Leica. The guy at work had put down a deposit on an M9 and told me that he would be willing to sell me the M6 cheaply on condition that I lend it back to him if he missed shooting film. One day while chewing the ear off another friend about Leica, he told me he thought the brand had become pretentious \u2014 \"It's just a very simple camera with luxury marketing. And the simpler it gets the more pretentious the claims are. They should make a pinhole camera, charge a fortune and market it as the most essential camera there is.\" That's it! I designed a little cardboard pinhole camera with a rectangular enclosure, and stole product photography from Leica's own website to map onto the box. With a small amount of money borrowed from a friend, I funded a print run of Leica-look-alke pinhole templates on heavy cardboard, scored along the fold lines, with instructions and a Sunny 16 exposure guide included. I designed and built a small website in the style of the leica-camera.com of the day, with a satirical \"Like-a\" red dot logo, and the most pretentious product copy I could come up with, connected to an ecommerce order form. At $20 each for a sheet of cardboard they were hand-crafted and approaching Veblen margins. With some creative Tweeting and some help from a few friends I managed to get picked up by the WIRED blog and a few others, and the orders started coming in. Much like the real Leica, some hated the idea of paying so much for so little, but many loved the idea and bought two or three for old friends who were Leicaphiles, or to add to a collection of other Leica paraphernalia. Eventually, I received a stern letter from Leica AG, scalding me for appropriating their logo and ordering a cease and desist. I complied of course, and told their Legal department that it was only a desire to buy one of their products that lead to all this. I tallied up the takings and was close enough to make an offer on the M6 and 35 Cron. I shot that camera and lens at the exclusion of all else for two or three years and found it punishing. The first three months produced the worst pictures I've ever taken. Out of focus, under exposed, just generally crap. But as each month went by I learned the camera intuitively and the pictures got better. When the Typ 240 was released, the same friend upgraded again, and I traded him back the M6 and some cash in exchange for the M9. I loved the M9, but it eventually succumbed to the sensor corrosion issue and when Leica offered an M or M-P upgrade I jumped to the M-P. The M10 is tempting, but I'll hold off for at least another generation (unless maybe there's an M10-P or Safari that's just too good to pass up).

True - and the Leica SL and APO-M 50 Summicrons are designed that way (and priced that way). As an aside, showing a picture at the size of a large iPad just reveals nothing important about fine sharpness and clarity. Jon's \"whole picture\" example looks fine, also - he had to show us the cropped details to reveal what was troubling him. Jon, to me, what you are getting is about what I've always seen from the v.4/5 Summicron. Prior to the Summarit lenses, it has always been Leica's \"entry-level\" M lens - the cheapest in the line. The one they used to throw into a kit with an M body, total price discounted $500/\u00a3400. Designed to a price point, and to work very well on middle-ISO gelatin film. - 60%+ contrast at 40 lppm, over most of the picture, at f/5.6. It is also what I was getting at in the \"End of the M\" thread - don't get too excited about 48 Mp until you have actually tried some of the M lenses, especially the ones designed in the film era and not revised for digital. There's a reason the APO-Summicron costs 3 times as much as the base Summicron. The only authoritative \"second opinion\" you can get is to send this lens to Leica themselves and ask if it is performing within specs. My experience says that they will say \"Yes, that is within specs at f/4.8.\" The good news is that this is \"gaussian\" blurring that responds rather well to digital sharpening algorithms, up to a point.

I am waiting on the report from Jerzy about the Oberlaender Ur replica. If there is any person who can tell us how Mr Oberlaender constructed his camera, it is Jerzy. It would be fascinating to see if he managed to get the frame counter to work. I have looked at this on photos of the original and there must be some little gear wheel arrangement to get the counter to turn in a different plane from the wind knob. The drawing on page 46 of Richter's book shows a spindle behind the frame counter but not how this is turned. William William, If I were to design the film counter, I would put a peg type cog at the top of the shaft running up from the frame counter with probably 6 or 8 pegs. These pegs on the cog would be struck by a peg in the wind on shaft and rotate say 1/8th of a turn at each turn of the wind on spindle. There would then be a 5:1 bevel gear at the bottom to rotate the frame counter. Then 40 frames would cause one rotation of the frame counter (8 x 5). This is the sort of technology that clock makers have used for years and would have been very familiar to the Wetzlar technicians.
