Improved detail rendition for greater image quality The fact that no color filter arrays are required means that there are fewer layers of glass and filter to impede the transmission of light or cause deflections. This is especially advantageous in a traditional rangefinder camera and results in decreased, fine-grained image noise. The M10 Monochrom delivers an exceptionally broad sensitivity range - from ISO 160 to ISO 100,000, while retaining full detail with the finest grain. This enormous sensitivity spectrum enables imagery with an extremely broad dynamic range - yielding results with areas of shadow and illumination clearly defined, particularly when shooting in uneven, high-contrast light. Understated and discreet for low-profile shooting The M10 Monochrom lives in a body technically identical with the M10-P range. The pared-back look and almost inaudible shutter make photographing with the M10 Monochrom a most discreet experience, ideal for capturing authentic moments without drawing attention to yourself. The strict omission of any color-inlaid engravings further emphasizes the camera\u2019s monochrome character.Utilising the full scope of the camera\u2019s capability With its high-resolution image sensor and faithful detail rendition, the Leica M10 Monochrom has significantly raised the bar in terms of camera quality and performance. This, in turn, means that only equally high-capacity lenses will be able to utilise all of the camera\u2019s performance reserves. Leica\u2019s M lenses \u2014 globally recognised as the world\u2019s best full-frame lenses - are the perfect match for the Leica M10 Monochrom, giving rise to an exceptionally high-performance combination.A reliable companion - Made in Germany As with all Leica M cameras, the M10 Monochrom is made almost entirely by hand by experienced specialists in an elaborate construction and assembly process and is robust enough to take on even the toughest of conditions. The Leica M10 Monochrom stands for exceptional quality and reliability that assures a companion for life.
