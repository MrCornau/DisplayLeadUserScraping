I have found B+W quite user-friendly and at beginner level it does not need to be an exact science, providing you follow the general developing instructions. It does give me a lot of satisfaction developing my own film. 2. the Plustek is easier to use than setting up a DSLR on a tripod etc. The image took about 2 mins to scan on the Plustek. I found the DSLR set up a chore, which was the main reason for getting the Plustek. 3. with the DSLR set-up you can treat yourself to a macro lens, which is good fun in its own right. 4. The Plustek was considerably cheaper than my macro lens - it probably cost a third of the lens. 5. The Plustek fits in my carry-on bag; very portable. I look forward to your comments.

Has anyone tried this? I would like to thank you for sharing that article. Very helpful in bettering my understanding of stand development. I've been meaning to try it for a while but have had too many questions. The weather is finally reaching 23 ish degrees Celsius (as opposed to the 35 last week) making it more environmentally feasible to finally give stand development a try. So if you'd indulge me and let me hijack this 'stand development' thread with my own questions. (1) If I have a development tank large enough. that can hold over 1 liter of chemicals; can i develop 2 rolls of 35mm film. 7 ml solution and 700 ml of water? 1 hour. inversions every 10 seconds for the first minute. Stand 30 minutes, one slow inversion, stand 30 minutes. (2) Can anyone elaborate more on the temperature control for stand development? Highest and lowest temperatures you've tried? (3) Am I wrong in assuming that one roll of 135 film the equivalent to one roll of 120 film and equivalent to one 4x5 sheet film? (it kind of seemed to work for me while I was souping HC110 and HP5). Does the same rationale apply to stand development? (4) I want to try stand development with sheet film (4x5 sheet film) in a 1 liter Patterson tank and the Mod 45 holders. Because of this, I do need one liter of fluids to ensure the sheet is immersed. At the same time I should only use 3.5 ml of rodinal.

Being a relative newcomer, I used a dSLR first (a Nikon D40), then tried out various other dSLR's and compacts. Five years ago, I started using a Minolta 35mm SLR and from then on, I was hooked on the challenge of \"not knowing\" until that cardboard envelope came back. If I was working professionally, rather than creatively, I would highly recommend the Sony A900 with the best Minolta lenses you could afford. I can only develop B&W film, as I couldn't handle the accuracy of colour. Luckily, I live near a branch of Snappy Snaps, who are fantastic with film. I really need a camera that will last as a long term purchase, and I don't have that sort of confidence in digital technology (not just reliability, but also future compatibility and never ending upgrades).

I am wondering if it is even worth it at this point being the technology is dated and I fear that my Fuji would shoot just as well due to its low light capabilities over the M9 / M-E.

I am saving up for my first Leica, I am a college student so I am by no means rich. The two Leica cameras that I have in mind are the M6 and M8. To start off. I have to say I prefer digital only because I don't have any places around me to develop film. At first I was almost certain that the M8 would be the camera for me. However after doing more research I found out that the M8 had problems such as sensor or LCD failure. I can't afford to buy a camera and have it break:(.
