I'm not convinced it has nothing to do with dynamic range. Surely, as you say, extending the 'range' of tones would also, at least theoretically, extend the range of highlight tones, and it is that which seems to be missing. You are assuming that the DR is equally distributed (or \"should be equally distributed\") around \"middle gray\"- which is not the case. The DR extension can be quite asymmetrical, with proportionally more range at the shadow end. Not totally useful, yet, but I've been exploring the M10 tone curves, and happen to have had a chance to compare the M240 curves (upon which the M246 sensor is based). Would love to get an MM or M9 (or even M8) CCD for comparison, but have not run across one to borrow, yet. Anyway, here is how the tone curves map out for M240, M10 and (for reference) Canon 6D - the DR is distributed about 4 stops on the highlight side of middle gray, and about 7.5 stops on the shadow side of middle gray (based on metering for a gray card with each camera - heavy blue line). Not symmetrical at all, but about a 2:1 ratio - and that is \"normal\" for all cameras I've checked so far.

Imaging resource reviewed most of the contenders about 4 years ago, B&H posted a review article, and there was one blog post. Both Olympus and Panasonic's G-9 used 8 shot technology. Pentax K-1 and some others used four shot. Each article explains the idea that with four shots spaced one pixelsite apart you can collect all four Bayer-filtered exposures and relate that to a single point in the finished image. Nobody seems to know where the next four shots are taken, but the most plausible answer is this pattern: X X O O X X O O with the X's indicating the first four shots and the O's the second set. But that gives us only twice as many pixel sites, not arranged like the original set but with complete color information for each site. Olympus then maps these into 2.5 times as many sites as in the original image (in a JPEG) and three times as many in a raw file. In the S1R and S1, Panasonic is giving us 4 times as many pixel sites in a final raw image, and doesn't produce a JPG.. But the resulting raw files are processed by existing software, which means that the software thinks it is getting a traditional Bayer-ized raw file with four times as many pixels, each pixel carrying only R, G, B or G information. This means for compatibility the nicely collected color information has to be spread around in the finished HR image. No wonder there can be color artifacts as well as the patterns of light and dark that I show above near a horizontal black-white edge.
