Everything \"remote\" could be done by wire. That\u2019s. Very true. Thinking further, the idea of the cleanest form is a good one. So what is really essential, and how do you deal with it? Body - Start with the M10 form factor (no removable baseplate, no screen, no dials and no buttons) and lose everything on it other that the mount and the optical view finder. Exposure -What exposure control would we need? If ISO can truly be fixed at, say 180 or 360, are sensors good enough for highlight and shadow recovery in post? I was taught to get the best exposure you can when you expose the image. That said, my preference would be a monochrome, for which I would (and do) accept Auto ISO, but with -2/3 exposure compensation. Shutter - on reflection, I like to control shutter speed, so the shutter dial would stay. On/Off - return of the collar around the shutter release button, with three settings, Off, On and WiFi. WiFi - Why WiFi? Well, I use my phone for remote triggering, reviewing images over a coffee afterwards, and would download select images if it was reliable. It could also be used to set location, time and date, and adjust exposure compensation or base ISO if needed. For those who don\u2019t want WiFi, it would just be a setting on the switch, like the never used continuous setting on the M9. You could just ignore that one click. Hotshoe - for an external viewfinder. I like the current optical viewfinder, but there are times the EVF is useful - for wides beyond 28mm; for exposure simulation when that is important; and its 90 degree flip up setting, though remote triggering with the phone is probably better. SD card - flash memory is fast, reliable and small, whereas SD cards are not so much. When will they become obsolete \u2026 Battery - as large as possible, and click in click out.

However, what it cannot do is render the extra fine detail that is produced by high-resolution sensors, as it is simply not there in the file. So no, it cannot replace a high-resolution sensor. And it can use a 40 MP file and give it the same boost again. No doubt that you capture tinier things with a higher-res sensor, given the same lens (assuming the lens resolves them... which is not a given with a lot of older glass, especially focused by old eyes). I think high MP sensors help sell expensive lenses (which have no point unless you can blackboard a big system resolution) and facilitate steep crops. Those sensor also help preserve a sufficient data volume with more severe forms of post-processing perspective correction. But the world has largely settled around 24mp mirrorless cameras, which suggests that statistically, that's acceptable for most uses. We're coming onto the eighth or ninth year for the Sony A7 line where the main camera still 24.2mp and includes models as late as July 2020 with 12.1mp(!) sensors. And certainly, a massive uptick in responsiveness or reliability in a camera can make an incidental upgrade compelling. For example, the M8/M9 architecture got to an 18mp resolution, but from the M240 on, the user experience improved considerably. More data was just a plus. My questions about obviation have more to do with having sufficient resolution for any size output than they are about catching the tiniest cheek fuzz of a 21-year-old woman in a head shot. I'm not sure that the smallest meaningful aesthetic level of detail has really moved off the \"texture of concrete\" or a \"non-aliased eyelash.\" Even in landscapes, I'm not sure that any picture has been made or broken by being able to resolve a telephone wire at 1000m vs 2000m. If there is an identifiable subject in a picture, it's hard to point to one that is defined primarily (or even appreciably) by the smallest thing a sensor or film grain can see. There is an \"ooh and ah\" factor to the microscopic, but that's for discussion sites. In prints, the only place you are not discarding most of the data for an output, the real mark a camera needs to hit is to create enough data about sufficient levels of detail aesthetically and enlarge for a normal viewing distance without adding blur or artifacts. Ansel Adams believed that this might take as few as 1 megapixels, which is obviously low, but the point remains that the bigger the print, the greater the normal viewing distance. This is the theory upon which depth of field relies - circles of confusion. By the numbers, you need 120dpi at a 1.5m viewing distance. From an M9, that's a 43.3\" (110cm) print, which is frankly enormous. Obviously with the M240/M10 you get a 50\"/127cm output at that resolution. My testing of Super Resolution was prompted by a project where I was making large prints (18\"/46cm short side) for a client from 24mp M files and wondered what the resulting image files (300dpi) would look like in an unrealistic 100% view on screen. If they don't show artifacts at that size, unrealistic as it is, there is zero real-world chance that anyone would detect issues in the finished prints, no matter how close they got to them. And when the prints from this experiment came back yesterday, they stood up to the 40cm scrutiny test (that's about the expectation for an adult's eye to even focus). So no pixels, no artifacts on a close-up look in person, on a print. The ultimate installation location for these would not allow a human to approach closer than 1.5m, so rescaling was always overkill anyway. I did read Margulis' article on unsharp masking and Super Resolution. I know what he wrote, but if his illustrations are indicative, his conclusions seem to assume a much higher tolerance for halos on high contrast edges.

The most obvious difference is that the latter two are color digital cameras. The original \"image\" as captured, is a checkerboard of pure red and green and blue pixels. .DNG images from those cameras must be \"demosaiced\" - which means brightness data is swapped around and borrowed (\"interpolated\") between neighboring pixels so that the green, red and blue pixels eventually come out as all three colors in varying amounts. That means the neighboring pixels have been \"averaged together\" or blurred together slightly - no pixels stand alone.

Not quite sure how they\u2019re doing this rate but I agree. Is the 35 well suited to portraits in your experience? I mean if you were to buy one lens would it be the 35 instead of a 50 or even a 90? @James1975 Given the choices of 35mm, 50mm or 90mm for an M10 Monochrom, I would go with the 35mm. With a 63\u00b0 angle of view, it can be used for environmental style portraits and the 35mm covers a lot of other bases very well. With a 35mm lens, you can get some distortion of facial features if you get too close to your portrait subject, so you have to keep that in mind. The 50mm works better as a portrait lens, but I find its 47\u00b0 angle of view to be too constricting - particularly when shooting in close quarters or indoors except for very large rooms. I have come to think of my 50mm as short telephoto for that reason. Sometimes 50mm is the focal length I need, though. It depends on the subject and the location. Of the three focal lengths, the 90mm would be the best strictly for portraits; its 27\u00b0 angle of view will allow you to get frame filling head shot type portraits without distortion and will give you a good bit of working distance from your subject, which will help them to be at ease. The 90mm would not be a good choice as an all around, one lens one camera kit, though; the field of view is too narrow for optimal all-around applications IMHO. Regarding lens selection for Leica M cameras, I have come to view the 28mm, 35mm and 50mm as the best choices for all-around shooting, with 24mm, 21mm, 18mm, 90mm and 135mm focal lengths being more specialized. 28mm and 50mm are my most often used focal lengths with 35mm coming in next. I have never had a 75mm Summicron M, but have always liked that lens. It can be very useful as a portrait lens while not being as much of a niche lens as the 90mm Summicron that I own. In my view, a great two lens kit would be a pair of Summicrons - a 35mm and a 75mm. For a one camera one lens kit, I would probably go for a 35mm lens, even though I seem to have usually gravitated to a 28mm more than a 35mm. The 28mm requires you to get closer to your subject to fill the frame, but gives your images a more dynamic, more three dimensional look - to my eye. The 35mm gives you a bit more working distance and produces images with a more relaxed look, for lack of a better term - again, to my eye, at least; others may see things differently. Each focal length lens requires a different approach to shooting with that lens in order to maximize results. Hope this will help in making your lens choice.

I wonder what @Steven, whose color sense I like, thinks about this? Below is the DeepL translation of Marco Cavina's conclusion on the 1m distance shots as well the general conclusions: Quote Moving to a distance of one meter, the different optical scheme, the flotation of the more modern version and the different course of the spherical aberration curve allow the older model to guarantee a slightly better legibility of the out-of-focus at f/1.4 and f/2 apertures, This advantage vanished at the following apertures due to the superior analytical power of the aspherical model, which is also reflected in the out-of-focus areas and, perhaps, also due to the location of the astigmatic planes that changes position on the focal plane when closing the diaphragm, as often happens with older bright lenses; even in this operating condition the modern version confirms itself exceptionally constant at the various diaphragms taken into consideration, showing a visible but not marked superiority at f/5.6 - 8 and much more evident at the larger apertures, producing however images characterised by a very strong contrast that, if perfect in black and white in ambient light with certain subjects, in the case of this banal \"souvenir photo\" it results a bit penalizing because it tends to plug the shadows and to accentuate the \"clipping\" of the high lights, while the 60's model allows a greater compensation, even if at the expense of the image brightness and with that yellowish cast that cries out for revenge or, at least, a CC20B filter. .. So these are two lenses with a very different performance: the old version, at maximum apertures, switches to blur in a more gradual way and, while resolving the necessary details with sufficient precision, returns a soft image with compensated contrasts; vice versa, the modern and ardent Asph. floating is colder, gives an almost brutal plastic detachment with a more indistinct blur and guarantees a very high contrast even at full aperture, a certainly exceptional feature that can be a boon or a bane, depending on the conditions and the subject; certainly the current Summilux, from a purely technical point of view, does not present the side of criticism: the colours are correct, the vignetting is acceptable, the distortion is well controlled, the rendering is uniform in the field, the resolution and contrast are constant right from the maximum aperture and at the various shooting distances: it is an instrument that does not set any limits a priori; where, instead, it could ignite discussions is in the \"artistic rendering\" of certain images, based on the poetry of words that do not cross the optical perfection but lucky overlaps and coexistence of aberrations fortuitously (or deliberately? ) present in the lens. As already said, Mandler's original Summilux is certainly not the right lens to shoot buildings or two-dimensional elements with minute details up to the edges to be reproduced sharply, however its smooth rendering, gradual bo-keh and contrast compensation make it a well-cut tool for environmental reportage in raw and contrasty light conditions; It must also be said that the later and modern versions produced towards the end of its long career present a less warm chromatic blend and - one would say - also a tweak to the spherical aberration that slightly modifies its behaviour, without however changing the personality of the lens. To summarize a brief personal opinion, I would say that the trajectory of the Summilux-M 35mm f/1.4 in half a century of life coincides with that of other Leitz lenses, evolved over time and transformed from instruments for poets to instruments for technicians: the principle of the manufacturer does not make a wrinkle: it is right and legitimate that, over the years, aberrations are resolved to the maximum degree, increasing resolution and contrast at all apertures, especially the larger ones, and in this field Leica has carried out a radical revision of undoubted effectiveness, also with an eye to the telecentric projection, since all models currently in production excel under this point of view; However, there remains the voice of those who use Leica and some of its lenses, among which the Mandler Summilux 35mm, to obtain effects linked also to the performance \"flaws\" so pitilessly detected and corrected by the Manufacturer; to these users I suggest to carefully try on the field the various lenses, choosing with the heart those that best suit their feeling, without looking too much at their age! ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/316803-monochrom-summilux-steel-rim/?tab=comments#comment-4134194", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "on 1/16/2021 at 7:33 am, a.noctilux said: ...marco cavina has a very nice article, here, long and very interesting read in italian... thanks. very informative. i don't know italian, but there is an easy way to read this: you can download a free version of the deepl translator, which is better than google translate for idiomatic translations, here. then, you highlight a text section between the images and then hold down the command key and click \"c\" twice and immediately get a very good translation on your screen. the article has a detailed comparison between the goggled, \"m3 version\" of the summilux 35 (11871) and the fle (11663) \u2014 with comparative pictures of the same subject at at a range of distances and a range of apertures. what strikes one immediate is how different the color rendition of the two lenses is: makes me think that the 11871 would be better for b&w than color, that it's lower contrast could be interesting for the m10, and that the bokeh for non-architectural subjects could be interesting. i wonder what @steven, whose color sense i like, thinks about this?

) present in the lens. as already said, mandler's original summilux is certainly not the right lens to shoot buildings or two-dimensional elements with minute details up to the edges to be reproduced sharply, however its smooth rendering, gradual bo-keh and contrast compensation make it a well-cut tool for environmental reportage in raw and contrasty light conditions; it must also be said that the later and modern versions produced towards the end of its long career present a less warm chromatic blend and - one would say - also a tweak to the spherical aberration that slightly modifies its behaviour, without however changing the personality of the lens. to summarize a brief personal opinion, i would say that the trajectory of the summilux-m 35mm f/1.4 in half a century of life coincides with that of other leitz lenses, evolved over time and transformed from instruments for poets to instruments for technicians: the principle of the manufacturer does not make a wrinkle: it is right and legitimate that, over the years, aberrations are resolved to the maximum degree, increasing resolution and contrast at all apertures, especially the larger ones, and in this field leica has carried out a radical revision of undoubted effectiveness, also with an eye to the telecentric projection, since all models currently in production excel under this point of view; however, there remains the voice of those who use leica and some of its lenses, among which the mandler summilux 35mm, to obtain effects linked also to the performance \"flaws\" so pitilessly detected and corrected by the manufacturer; to these users i suggest to carefully try on the field the various lenses, choosing with the heart those that best suit their feeling, without looking too much at their age! ________________________frog leaping photobook", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 24176, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 386782, "autor": "leica-curious", "date": 1620018120000, "content": "I opened the back up again a moment ago to take another look.

So right Colin........I don't have any Leica M's from back then in London when I started in this game professionally, ( that was the mid' to late 1960's ), but I do have two Nikon Ftn 2's, a FE and a F3 still having bought them new at various times in past decades when they came out. With all of them I earned my way in advertising and editorial fashion work plus later some documentary and film work when I moved to the US working there for nearly 30 years before returning to Europe. The Nikons never skipped a beat, just cleaned at times after working in marginal locations and conditions perhaps but never fully serviced and they are still functioning pretty much perfectly. I was using the F3 today in fact.I also used Leica M2's back then as well, they too never let me down but unlike the Nikons they needed some deeper servicing a couple of times before I sold them on.........................Whereas all my digital M's, with the exception of the M10-M so far, ( fingers crossed ), have had to return to Wetzlar for one reason or another. The M10-D is still there on it's fourth trip since new, this time awaiting delivery of parts, don't they have stock of spares for recent cameras? I would have thought so, but maybe not.

Well, well. The question which started this thread was whether and why people hid the serial numbers of their gear when showing images in this forum, i.e. the internet. You can not possibly show physical photographs in the internet. All photographs made visible in the internet have been converted into a digital form, be it in the camera or later from a tangible medium. Cameras and scanners do store some items of data along with the representation of the image; examples are the date, time, location, exposure details. Some of those devices also store information identifying the gear which made the digital representation of the image. Once you publish digital images made with the same digitizing equipment in different sites in the internet, you make revealing your identity easier, if those images contain data identifying your gear. Becoming identifyable in the internet across several platforms is a security issue.

So did the SLR I bought in 1985 which exposed film. That does not make it a computer. In a digital camera the image is formed by an optical lens. You can even use the lenses of 150 year old cameras to make images with a digital camera. The difference lies in the medium recording the image. I have no one heard calling film photography \"chemically assisted imaging\". That would be equally absurd. The image is not formed by chemical processes. It is formed by the lens or an equivalent optical apparatus. Computer aided imaging consists of a computer transforming data captured by another device (or merely computed data) into a form which can be visually represented as an image. The image may be presented on a screen or on a permanent medium, but it's a computer generated image. That's a far cry from electronically recording and processing images projected by optical devices.

I did indeed miss focus on this photo and it's funny I was going to write that in my reply to @ianman Since this was the first day I received the lens - I was shooting the lens very loosely in this location as I was mostly excited to have a lot of test shots and variety to see later how glowy (or otherwise) it is.

I realised I was probably too close to the shoe for it to fall into 'zone' so I tuned in the focus and shot 2 more.

My casualness on this walk aside, I'm sure focussing at 1.4 is going to be a challenging though - Next time I go out with the lens I'll look forward to being a bit more attentive and see how it goes (the lens is off for a check over at the moment).

This time it took only five minutes to adjust the focusing ramp such that when the lens reads \"infinity\", so does my rangefinder on my M10. I then quickly set it up for photos at ISO 100 at each aperture, 2, 2.8. 4, 5.6, 8, 11, and 16. My biggest issue was center focus at f/2. That has been corrected on this lens - while it looks slightly better as I stop down, even the f/2 image is acceptable - in the center. As I stop down the sides of the image get sharper, and by f/4. and better yet, f/5.6, the results are acceptable (but not like a Leica lens). For my desire to use it on my M8.2, the lens is perfect as-is. I guess I get to start testing/using it for regular images. I know I'm not sending this one back. By the time it reaches f/11, I don't see any issues, even in the corners. I'm in no way any kind of \"professional lens tester\", but I know for my purposes, this lens is a keeper. For use on my M10 in India, where it's dirty and dusty, and I might not want to be walking around with a gazillion dollar Leica lens, this lens is also fine for me. (I'm no longer a working photographer, and even if I was, I'm not able to spend what new Leica gear costs, and luckily, I haven't much of a desire to step \"up\" from my M10.) I still have the problem of getting the same exposure as I expect. As I went through my seven photos, starting at f/2, through f/16, when I close the aperture by one stop, the shutter should also need to be adjusted by one stop. I ignored that, and set the shutter speed until my built-in meter indicated the right setting. This may be a real issue for using the lens on a film Leica - I wonder if the \"click stops\" for each aperture are in the correct location. That's the only thing I can think of that might cause this. Maybe the lens is fine, but the aperture markings on the lens are in the wrong location, along with the \"click stops\". My person advice for anyone buying one of these lenses, buy it, adjust the focus ramp on the lens to match your camera, test it at all apertures, and if it's good enough for you (for a mere $300ish) keep it. If it's not sharp wide open in the center, send it back for a replacement. Others here might be much more qualified than I am (not) to test the lens, and who might offer much better advice. It does come with a focusing target, and that's how 7Artisans wants us to test the lens, but if the rangefinder doesn't indicate \"zero\" at infinity, I would never be satisfied with the lens. ---------- Testing with the M8.2 was much nicer. From f/5.6 on, the images were acceptable. The M8.2 creates different \"color\" images, warmer, and in some ways nicer than the M10, but the M10 has so much more detail. I think this lens was made for my M8.2 camera I have no idea yet how it will work with film, so I'll trust what others here have written.

For something of this magnification, you\u2019d be better served with a 3-series or 5-series tripod from Gitzo or RRS along with a proper gimbal head. So in general, I think the 2-series is a good balance between lightweight and rigidity but it may depend on what you want to do with it. Some applications like multi-shot is more demanding and wind can make it much more challenging in which case you may need a more sturdy tripod than the 2-series. Otherwise, if you\u2019re not using multi-shot and just shooting at high magnification in lower light, good long lens technique will get you a quite far with a 2-series. Examples of long lens techniques include: Avoid extending the center column if not needed Avoid extended thinner leg sections if not needed Keeping your camera balanced over the head with foot plates Ensuring you lock down the knobs on the tripod head Using remote trigger if possible If using a SLR, raising the mirror before taking the shot Using electronic shutter if it makes sense to do so Adding some weight to the system by hanging a bag on the center column (don\u2019t let it swing of course) to make the legs more stable Resting your hand on top of the lens to dampen any shock from the shutter or mirror slap If it\u2019s really windy, setting up in a slightly more sheltered location or keeping lower to the ground and splaying out the legs a bit more while reducing the number of leg extensions used Edited April 7 by beewee", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/319661-do-you-useneed-1000-tripod/?tab=comments#comment-4175869", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "i don\u2019t use tripods often but i do have a couple gitzo legs kicking around including a 2-series mountaineer, 1-series traveler, monopod, and a mini tripod. my biggest lens is the canon 300mm f/2.8 is. the 2-series mountaineer with a rss bh-40 works well enough on something like a sl2 + 90-280 without any additional aids. in my case, i used it extensively with a 70-200/2.8. i can get by with the 300/2.8 on my 2-series but i normally prefer adding a wimberley sidekick which turns the tripod head into a gimbal and this is stable up for daytime shooting with a 300/2.8 + 2x extender. if i were to stack a 300/2.8 + 2x + 1.4x extender on it, it becomes a bit twitchy and you\u2019d want to use a remote trigger and maybe even electronic shutter. for something of this magnification, you\u2019d be better served with a 3-series or 5-series tripod from gitzo or rrs along with a proper gimbal head. so in general, i think the 2-series is a good balance between lightweight and rigidity but it may depend on what you want to do with it. some applications like multi-shot is more demanding and wind can make it much more challenging in which case you may need a more sturdy tripod than the 2-series. otherwise, if you\u2019re not using multi-shot and just shooting at high magnification in lower light, good long lens technique will get you a quite far with a 2-series. examples of long lens techniques include: avoid extending the center column if not needed avoid extended thinner leg sections if not needed keeping your camera balanced over the head with foot plates ensuring you lock down the knobs on the tripod head using remote trigger if possible if using a slr, raising the mirror before taking the shot using electronic shutter if it makes sense to do so adding some weight to the system by hanging a bag on the center column (don\u2019t let it swing of course) to make the legs more stable resting your hand on top of the lens to dampen any shock from the shutter or mirror slap if it\u2019s really windy, setting up in a slightly more sheltered -----> location !!!  or keeping lower to the ground and splaying out the legs a bit more while reducing the number of leg extensions used edited april 7 by beewee", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 28026, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 415112, "autor": "pippy", "date": 1617813300000, "content": "2 hours ago, pgk said: ..There are only two types; those which hold the camera steady and those which don't.

Hello: \"Just wondering how you are checking to confirm you do or do not have geotagged metadata.\" You can see if the camera wrote Geotagging data to the image file right in the Fotos app on your mobile device connected to the camera before transferring any photos to your mobile device. Just connect the camera to the Fotos app. Tap on the image in the Fotos app for single image display mode, then swipe up on the same image to pull up the EIXF data. If the geotagging data was written to that image file you will see it just above ISO/F/S/EV data again all before you decide to transfer that image to your mobile device or not. FWIW. Since my last post on this topic Sept 29, 2021 in this thread, and after I updated the SL2 to ver 3.0 and performed a camera reset to get my Geotagging working again, my Geotagging has been working 100% ever since. As long as I don't let me iPhone fall asleep--no issues. For Geotagging I try to remember to set the iPhone to \"never sleep\".

As the conversation progressed, the client revealed that they needed a single image backdrop 'wallpaper' behind their topiary display of life-sized New Forest animals. And it would need to be 15 x 2.5 metres in size. And they would like heather in the foreground, trees in the distance and blue sky, preferably in 'thirds'. And can they have it by next Tuesday (four days away)? Nothing like a deadline and a strong 'wish list'... It became clear that I would need to shoot a specific image to fit the format (extremely narrow) which would ideally be of a flat landscape - as undulations would upset the third/third/third proportions. Weather forecast wasn't great, but very early Sunday morning looked to have a couple of clear hours and there was one possible location which still had a good flourish of heather and an almost flat horizon. The company printing the backdrop requested 100dpi as the viewing distance could be as little as 1.5m. A quick 'new document' in photoshop revealed a 1.6Gb filesize! The only possible ways to get anywhere near this amount of photographic data with my current equipment was to use the SL2 with a 4-shot stitch from 'Multi-shot' originals in landscape format or a 12-shot stitch from 'regular' portrait format originals. On the morning of the shoot, conditions were perfect, clear sky, practically no wind and a light dew accentuating the colour in the heather. Lens choice was 75mm APO Summicron M, set to f/11. The depth of field does deliberately fall off in the foreground, allowing the 'real' stand display to visually blend into the background (see images 5 and 6) I did shoot both options for stitching, however the 12-shot 'portrait' stitch ended up giving the better result. All images were processed from the DNG files into 16-bit files and then assembled using Photoshop's photomerge (using blend and vignette removal options). The end result was a 3.4Gb 16-bit file which required very little additional work, a minor amount of upsizing (effectively to get the height of the image up to 2.5m at 100dpi). Finally downsampled to 8-bit and sent to client as a 1.6Gb Tiff file. The client was awarded a \"Silver Gilt\" award for their stand - a truly wonderful achievement for a first show at Chelsea.

I find the SL primes are smaller, more compact and easier to handle while moving quickly. I also find that even at 28mm, I can get unique subject separation with a rendering that I can\u2019t achieve with zooms (at least not the SVE). If the goal is shooting stopped down (f/5.6+), then the only advantage the APO SL primes have over something like the SVE is the size/weight, and micro contrast at the far corners at the expense of flexibility in focal length. If I wanted to save weight and don\u2019t require additional focal lengths, the Sigma 24mm f/3.5 is just as sharp out to the corners when stopped down to f/5.6-f/8. The Sigma 24 f/3.5 DG DN is an absolute bargain at 1/10th the price and a little more than 1/4 the weight of the APO Summicron SL primes but lacks the unique rendering found in the APO SL when shooting wide open. When I\u2019m in the mountains, I generally don\u2019t feel the need for anything more than a single 21/24/28mm depending on location that I\u2019m shooting. Counter intuitively, I find places that have large open valleys and where peaks are farther away, like alpine meadows, usually mean I can shoot narrower (i.e. 28mm) while places with peaks that are much closer require a wider field of view. Overall, 24mm seems to be an ideal compromise for me. Where I would most definitely choose the SVE over the APO SL primes would be while shooting out of a car or on a boat where weight is less of an issue and there are more variety in subject matter that would benefit from different focal lengths, while changing lenses may be undesirable due to environmental factors such as dust on gravel roads or sea spray on a boat. So for something like touring fjords, the SVE would be the way to go, but for slow changing scenery or places that I\u2019m mainly focused on shooting landscapes such as on a hike, APO SL primes are the way to go for me. I think if I could have a dream lens for time in the mountains, I would want something like the Panasonic 20-60mm, with an aperture of f/4, have the APO SL build and size that weighs less than 750g and ideally around 500g, and sharpness similar to Sigma 24 f/3.5 DG DN.

It was in 2018 and is no less a performer in 2021. Whether other cameras surpass its performance ... Well, the CL already performs better than is needed for 99.9% of any photographer using it, so what does that really matter? If the camera's feature set is suitable for your uses and you enjoy using it, it's a fine purchase regardless of what it costs or what its monetary value might be in the future. By and large, lenses for Leica M cameras retain their value far better than lenses for any other Leica camera mounts, and better than most other brands of lenses as well. Leica M bodies retain their value better than any other Leica camera model bodies as well.

I buy my equipment based on what the equipment performs like ... I'm only concerned with its monetary value at the point where I'm buying it and again at the point where I consider selling it.
