I've got an open mind and can see there are enough of you on this threat ......Help me out. As others have said, this is an issue that applies differently to different photographers. But, since you asked, chimping allows me to review the exposure and framing from each shot. With exposure, chimping helps me see whether I'm clipping important highlights (and how much contrast there is in a scene when I might want to stop down and thereby increase internal reflections and boost the blacks on lenses that behave that way). After using my camera for a while, I'm comfortable with how the meter usually operates so that I can visualize which scenes will require manual intervention before I raise the camera to my eye in the first place; therefore, chimping is only useful in a few edge cases for me, and I can walk away from those images (or manipulate them appropriately in post if the image warrants it, which they never yet have). For framing from shot to shot, chimping requires moving the camera away from the eye; therefore, the camera is no longer in the same spot; therefore, precise framing is unlikely to be achieved; therefore, chimping has little value to me. Again, there are edge cases where boundary subjects are important and need to be balanced, but then I know this, balance them, and take the picture. For studio work, especially work that requires thin depth of field and/or multiple and precise lighting sources, I can see chimping as an invaluable asset. For anyone getting paid to create images: yes, being able to review in seconds rather than minutes can make all the difference between \"professional\" and \"amateur.\" I make no argument that others should be willing to walk away from chimping. Personally, though, for how I shoot, if a camera only had enough of a display for menu options, I'd be fine; but then, might as well add a review screen, and then you get to the M9, which is what I (happily) shoot. I use the screen to set ISO (obviated by the Edition 60's wheel), check battery life, play with menu options (because I'm of the Nintendo generation and that's what I do), and occasionally review images in the field when I'm not sure what my eye is telling me. (Not to say that my eye is neigh on infallible; it isn't, by a long shot; just, I'm not aware of its failings as much as I'd like to be, so I don't know when I really ought to have chimped that last shot.) In other words, chimping for me isn't just unnecessary, it is a distraction. I adore the \"flow\" that the window-finder helps me achieve in relation to a subject, particularly moving subjects.

Although I must admit that the M9 is simply a more mature camera, the M8 is really complementary as a second body. Advantages of M8 IMO compared to the M9: - it crops but that makes some frames easier to see with glasses. e.g. I do not like the 35mm frames on the M9 but I like them on the M8 because they are the largest you can see with glasses on without moving your eye around. - the crop makes it an ideal 'tele' M. If you know you will have to crop the M9 shot anyway, why not use the M8? take a 90 or 135 and if you need to 'zoom' closer than 135mm on FF you can use the M8 just as well as the M9 - B & W pictures have this little extra... - 1/8000 exposure time for shooting wide open with fast lenses - 24mm frame available, and if you use the edges of the VF, a 21mm can be used without external VF - great for older lenses with edge or corner issues, because it only uses the center part of the glass - the files are lighter and still plenty for the prints I make Disadadvantages: - color is unusable IMO without UV/IR cut filters. I can not see how Leica imagined us using this camera without filters. - Even with filter, the color of the M9 is better - cropped, so less ideal equivalent focus length e.g with 50mm - does not have a manual lens picking menu, so if you shoot a lot with older lenses like me, the wide angle ones (40 or shorter) actually need encoding before they are as they should be. I think Leica could solve this if they wanted by a firmware update, but of course this will never happen. - one stop less in dynamic range.

Using a high quality 18 percent grey card in direct sunlight, I made a series of measurements that raise more questions than I myself can answer, so I'm hoping some of you may be able to help. The idea is that the camera, using aperture priority, should pick a shutter speed equal to the ISO value. Instead, with spot metering, the shutter speeds are double the expected value: ISO 100 : 1/200 ISO 200 : 1/400 ISO 400 : 1/800 etcetera With centre-weighted metering the results are different (though they should be the same, having taken care to fill the frame with the grey card): ISO 100 : 1/160 ISO 200 : 1/320 ISO 400 : 1/640 etcetera Now to make things even more complicated, I found that in manual mode, the on screen exposure meter reads zero at a third set of values: ISO 100 : 1/125 ISO 200 : 1/250 ISO 400 : 1/500 etcetera With this final test, there was no difference between spot and centre-weighted metering, which presents us with yet another riddle... Can anyone explain this? Or try to replicate these results with their Vario, just to rule out that I have a faulty item?

Fortunately I noticed, that unlike most lens hoods this version is made from two parts held together by three small screws, it should therefore be possible to remove the original hood part and replace it with a wider or longer (depending on when you were seeing the flare) version modified to fit the original screw part of the hood. I measured the thread at 64mm and plastic versions with thread of this size are available on sites like eBay. As they are plastic the thread could be easily removed and the hole left widened slightly to allow it to fit over the original thread and then be retained with the screws. Thank you Bob. I had not noticed the three screws on the thread anulus of the original hood - on mine the screw holes have been filled - presumably with wax - thus the actual tiny screws are under the wax. So yes it should be possible to remove them and attach the anulus to a larger hood. My home-made hood tended to fall off occasionally because the foam did not always grip tightly onto the original hood - so I've made a Mk II version --img--  This utilises an SRB 82mm threaded 105mm diameter wide angle hood - which has been extended by 12mm by securing (gluing) another section of detergent tub onto the front after first covering same with self adhesive valour. The detergent tub is conical so there's a matching 105mm-ish section where its diameter matches that of 105mm diameter SRB hood. To attach the WA hood's 82mm thread to the lens' female 65mm* hood thread, requires stepping rings. I'm using 82mm to 77mm, plus 77mm-67mm \u2026 and have ordered a 67mm to 65mm from Russia - the only source found offering 65mm stepping rings. The 12mm extension length was ascertained by trial and error i.e. by gradually cutting back to a length which does not cause any vignetting at small apertures. I measured the OEM Leica lens hood attachment thread as 65mm* \u2026 but if as you state it's 64mm will have to source another 67mm to 64mm stepping ring \u2026 or remove the annulus from the original hood and screw it onto another plastic anulus secured onto the 82mm hood. I do not have any 64mm or 65mm diameter filters or accessories to check the actual diameter of the lens' outer hood thread. This might appear to some to be a lot of effort but once secured properly it will enable flare free imaging in those situations where there are a lot of extraneous nocturnal illuminations e.g. fairgrounds, city centres, seafront promenades, and particularly London's West End where there's a wealth of interesting night-time subjects. Unfortunately the lens' 60mm filter thread cannot be utilised to attach an accessory hood because at the 70mm zoom setting the lens front is pulled inside the lens mount - thus anything attached of wider diameter compromises focusing. The lens' original Leica hood is rather too small to be effective in all situations - but it was designed to be reversible which enables easy storage.

Let's just deconstruct this statement shall we? \"Living abroad\" suggests that the starting point is Germany and German law. I don't \"live abroad\", I live in my home and my domestic law applies to me. If I enter into a contract here, typically my (local) laws apply to me - now, that may mean as a part of my local laws (conflict of laws), a contract to supply a German magazine under an online subscription is governed by German Law, or it might not. Generally, when transacting online, the applicable law is not the law where the material is loaded or an offer made, but the law applicable to the person who accesses the material. So, if I make a share offer (or similar) from here in New Zealand, and a person from the US accesses that offer, I have to comply with the US consumer protection legislation and all the rather more complex legislation relating to share offers and prospectuses at State and Federal level. Similarly, if I say something offensive to you which is defamatory in the UK, and is accessed in the UK, I can get dragged before the UK courts to answer for my defamatory remarks (though the UK has recently restricted such forum shopping). The general approach with online commerce is that the law of the person accessing the material (rather than the one loading it) applies - under that law, the parties may agree to German or other law applying, but there will be limits. So, back on topic, many countries have unsolicited mail legislation (we certainly do) where if I get sent a magazine, book or anything else without asking for it, I can keep it, I don't have to return it and I do not have to pay for it (a generalisation, but you get the picture). Whether or not LFI can require cancellation of a subscription in order to stop supplies around the globe is questionable. It might be legal in Germany, but I'd be surprised if that was the case in all countries where they post it. Local consumer protection legislation usually prevails. On a final note, I think it is sophistry to describe LFI as much more than a promotional publication for Leica. Like Pop, I recall Leica (or ACM) taking ownership of the magazine, and if you think companies are not answerable to their shareholders you might like to think again. The entire driving force for many company take-overs is to get hold of technology ... If that doesn't convince you, show me the last time LFI published an article on something not made by Leica (it is Leica Fotographie after all) or when it was at all critical of a Leica product.

Later Neil Take a look at my magazine(s) (ColoradoSeen - link in my signature). They are hosted by a site called ISSUU, from which I can embed a version displayed in my own site. Sort of a \"Youtube\" for non-motion image design. Basically I make a .pdf file of my \"portfolio\" (magazine layout) page by page. I lay mine out in Adobe InDesign, but there are lots of ways to do that. Then export the .pdf, as a sequence of single pages (i.e. NOT spreads!). I upload that to ISSUU, and their software internally converts it to the \"flippable\" animated file, reassembling the spreads in correct order. Essentially it is a conversion to Adobe Flash, although since Flash won't display on iOS phones, they have an iOS-compatable player as well. Result - a web \"object\" that flips like a book or magazine. Size can be anything that fits on a computer screen. I have small thumbnails on my web site, and clicking the fullscreen symbol lower right blows it up for detailed viewing. There are some other similar publishing/hosting sites, such as Scribe. I don't know if any replicate ISSUU's animation technique, though.

It is preferred that we shoot at ISO 200.... Done.... perfect exposure PP till you get what you want Say you cant arrive at the exposure you want at base (200) with the tools available. You up the ISO and we all agree 400 800 and 1600. Depending on your end result they will work \"almost\" as well as ISO 200. noise contrast and color are more than acceptable....to me? I see your point but I don't think it makes sense to LOCK your camera on ISO 200 and bring out/back in Post for every shot......then tweak for you desired result. To me that seems like theory not real world...and too much work I do think of this like film, right or wrong it seems to me that's how this camera was designed to be used? ISO200 is your \"sweet spot\" then as needed you have additional choices available 200 to 1600 ISO, then you are free to adjust out the specific quarks that are inherent when you leave the base and add your particular feeling /quality at the end. Same holds true for 2000 through 6400 in this range you have a real challenge to use or try to adjust the file so you can obtain an acceptable amount of evils.....a difficult task at 6400 but depending how bad you want the shot , 2000 to 3200 could be made acceptable ...again depending on your expectations......Remember how we lowered our expectations when we had to shoot Trix at 1600 developing it in Accufine ? The M240 shot 6400 looks better than that. We accepted those giant balls of grain for the sake of getting the shot. When I asked the question of how you all deal with the \"sweet spot \"in ISO I never expected the conversation to go the direction of ISO 200 is the best with \"I under expose and fix it later, because the result of a 200 ISO shot 2 or 3stops underexposed yields a better result then using 400 800 or 1600.\" Did I read your posts correctly? I rarely make giant prints and I'm pretty good in Photoshop but I dont think locking my camera at ISO200 and adjusting for every shots exposure for best result first is a method of shooting I can adopt?

And yes, I've never fully tumbled to ISO either... ASA is still where it's at in my head. That said, \"right or wrong\" all you're doing when you dial up the ISO on your Leica is fooling the meter into thinking that there's more light than there is. There may be some electronic wizardry going on in the processor, but the sensor records at ISO 200 regardless of what you set the ISO at... unlike film whose sensitivity actually varied with the emulsion formulation. So, you can blithely twirl the ISO dial all you want... and let the electronics figure out what to do with the signal, or you can mentally calculate how many stops you're off, and make the exposure. Twiddling the ISO will make the .jpg look properly exposed, and it'll be pleasing on the LCD and make you smile, but it won't give you a .dng image with the least amount of noise possible. And don't worry... I've known about this since the dawn of digital sensors and I still have a tough time wrapping my head around it when I'm actually taking an exposure. And frankly, in most cases I'm not sure that there's enough difference between what's recorded at ISO 200 and ISO 800 to worry about it... My point, though, is still that ISO is a dated film concept that has no valid application on a sensor past its base sensitivity. Everything else is done by a processor and signal-to-noise amplifier. ISO is merely a device for fooling a light meter and letting old guys like us think in terms we're used to. If digital cameras didn't have a variable ISO setting when they were introduced, no one would have bought them because we'd all have thought we were locked into whatever the base sensitivity of the sensor is. Well, we are... but the manufacturers let us think we aren't, and let us use our meters and all three exposure settings anyway as if we weren't. The Lytro camera is another thing I just can't get my head around... changing perspective and focus in an image that's already captured? There are concepts coming down the pike that just don't fit the ideas that we older guys have about imaging... I recently bought a Mamiya AFDii outfit... I've had it a couple of weeks, and I'm going to resell it because I just bought a Mamiya 645 pro outfit that still has the manual dials I'm used to. I used to like to play with the new stuff... and I don't any more. It's not because I can't figure it out, I just don't want to. I'd rather make images the way I'm already comfortable with rather than have to learn a new process before I can make the same images. The evolution of technology is a two-edged sword. There's cool new stuff... but rather than learning it, I'd rather spend my time doing making images instead of figuring out how to use new the technology. Perhaps that's the tempering that comes with maturing?

I haven't posted here before, mainly because I don't use a Leica - always been fearful that, were I to take a leap into your world, I would get hooked and it would become very expensive!I am extremely disappointed to read a couple of the posts on this thread because my staff and myself work extremely hard here to offer an excellent service. As far as I am aware, we are the only lab in the UK currently investing seriously in our lab business, and, we continue to grow our film processing, scanning and printing volumes - to the point where we have recently had delivered another Noritsu 37 series printer and we are having a new HS-1800 scanner currently made for us in Japan to go with this - these will be operational within the next 4 weeks or so. This is in addition to other investments we have made in the last 9 months including the commissioning of 50\" C-Type print service with the Lightjet and 50\" autopan processor and the introduction of a Flextight X5 scanner. This sort of investment is only possible because we offer a high quality service, through which we can grow the business and retain customers. If there is something someone doesn't like, then, obviously, it's extremely important to me that we address this. I am only interested in offering a top quality service, but competitively priced, because of our reliance on the latest, most efficient, equipment and our low clerical overhead. Our customer base includes a huge range of photographers, from beginners all the way to the likes of Magnum members, fine art exhibitions etc. I had intended to start sending films to UKFilmLab but they're moving to BC, Canada. Can anyone suggest a UK colour film processing and scanning service which provides the same sort of service i.e. not just sending the film through the scanner on auto but personally monitoring and maximising each frame's scan? I'm sick and tired of duff scans from the usual budget labs i.e. Peak Imaging, AG Photographic, Snaps etc. Has anyone tried Photographique? I can't say I'm impressed by the few samples on the website. Any other suggestions? I don't want to scan my holiday photos myself. Pete Pete - I have three guys here who judge every image manually, whether it be for scan or print. All three of them are extremely experienced. If you feel you have had a \"duff\" scan, our policy would always be to fix it. Did you contact us? We may have a competitive price, but this is because we have efficient plant and systems, NOT because we cut corners. Please feel free to contact me directly and we will re-scan or scan a film for you FOC. Pete - I was using UKFilmLab for C41 & E6 processing & high-res .jpgs having despaired of AGPhoto and Peak Imagings' dust & spot-ridden negs/slides (which I scanned with my V700 then spent ages 'spotting'). When they announced the move to Canada they mentioned that postal costs etc would still be competitive. IIRC, they should be up and running by the end of the month - why not see what their costs actually are? Keith - the last order I can find for you is from January this year where we processed 1 roll of E6 for you. After we sent the \"dispatched\" email, you responded that you had already received the film, and scanned it, and commended us with the words \"Excellent service\". I don't see how this squares with your statement above, and we have not heard from you since, or before, in respect of any problem. Please contact me to let us rectify any issues? We are more than willing to do so. I think if you are going to post such a message, on a public forum, without first contacting us, it is grossly unfair and completely disproportionate. In terms of E6, we regularly process a sack load of E6 120 film for a couple of well known landscape photographers - who also scan all their own film - we have never had any complaints or problems. If anyone wants to contact me privately I can put you in touch with them. This is in addition to numerous other customers, all of whom have very high standards.

I should have begun with \"Don't get me started\" - too late, Michael - You are a true film photographer through and through. I wish I could have your end to end workflow. Thanks for your post. Adam, I think you are mistaken in implying that \"non-professional grade\" film is necessarily (and meaningfully) inferior to film which says \"professional\" on the box. When I shoot colour film, I choose the film based on the colour characteristics and look that I am after (taking into consideration the light that I am shooting in). This means I might choose \u00a31 \"Poundland\" film instead of \u00a37 Portra. If I am prioritising minimising grain, I may choose Ektar. (As a sidenote, I have been experimenting with converting Ektar to B&W and am considering using it as a relatively grain free C41 alternative to XP2 or Fuji Neopan 400CN.) I really don't think there are any duff films out there nowadays, at least not ones made by Kodak or Fuji, just different palettes and grain characteristics. In fact, were I keen on a \"lo-fi\" aesthetic (a perfectly acceptable objective, if that's someone's thing) I'd probably be a bit disappointed that what is generally available is all a bit too good. Ian - thanks for your reply. I am not sure that you responded squarely to my question, which was whether you'd use non pro-grade film as a general workflow. It sounds like you use non-pro film on certain occasions. It is not clear, though, how often this is. What does the poundland film give you that a portra doesn't do better? This is not a sarcastic or rhetorical question by any means. It seems that you've used it with great results and I'd love your insights. Btw, you might try the Ilford Pan-F 50 for the low grain B&W alternative. I find the tonality wider and richer than the Ektar converted... With all the sophisticated post-processing tools, the answer is \"Why not use so-called non-professional film stock.\" Motion picture people do it as a regular practice. Think more, type less. . I have found that - as a general matter - non-pro film stocks don't scan as well and aren't as malleable as pro-film stocks.

As mentioned above, I don't see any dud films out there at the moment - Just different renderings. Cheers, Eoin Hi Eoin - great thoughts. I really appreciate it. You've set forth a number of factors that MAY come into play. But I guess I am asking what specific fact pattern would exist that would justify using non-pro film stocks on a LEICA with top optics. By non-pro films, I am referring to those film stocks on today's market that are at least half the price of the portras or fuji pro 400H. Examples are Kodak Gold or UltraMax, Fuji Superia, and Agfa Vista. It is a little difficult to imagine that there is a critical mass of people who will purchase a Leica camera and a good Leica lens yet can't afford to pay $4 more for the roll of film. I suppose that I can imagine a situation in which a person inherits the gear or buys the gear really beat up. But I am talking really high level general. As far I can remember 'professional film' was cut from the center zones of the ~~1,5m wide layer rolls emulsion coated. Reason was a minimum lesser tolerance in layer and emulsion thickness. But it must have been less to zero compared with 'non professional', I never mentioned one. Thomas Very interesting insight, Thomas. Thanks for sharing it. I think your premise is flawed. When using legacy technology, why would cost be an overriding factor? People use old lenses for the very reason that they \"taint\" the image. Why would not someone like the way a so-called \"non professional\" film renders? Of course, there could be operational reasons as well, for instance if you live in a part of the world or even the country where the processing of the so called professional film is overly inconvenient to come by. Pop - I am not following you. Old Leica lenses are not inferior at all when to comes to film, and they are superior to many old non-Leica lenses. Not sure you grasped my premise, which is probably my fault for not making it clear. Totally see your \"operational reasons\" point; that makes perfect sense but my question was geared to those who have all film stocks readily available. Use a higher grade low grain film that gives good accurate colour reproduction and you can add grain or an alternative impressionistic colour palette in post processing. If you are working on a body of work ( as opposed to making disparate individual photographs) this has considerable advantages as it means you can tweak each image to conform to the overall look you want while at the same time being able to use a wider variety of film stock. So yes, use better film. And you get up in the morning and spend a day shooting, always with the prospect of an exceptional image, but you shoot on cheap film to save \u00a33. How much is your time worth? You can make an image more grainy, but you can't make it less grainy. You can make a sharp film stock softer, but you can't make a soft film stock sharper. So is cheap film fundamentally worth it, basically no. Is it worth it for fun, put it into a P&S as a second camera, yes. But if you are putting any sort of effort into your photography I think you need to use the best you can, you only get one chance. Steve Steve - with the exception of Doc Henry and possibly ManoLeica, I think we may be the lone \"pro-film stock snobs\" on the LUF forum. --img--  I agree with most of your post, but I disagree with the above if we are considering films in the context of a process, scan, edit/fiddle and print workflow. Suppressing grain and sharpening (an abused art if ever there was one) are simple processes with any of the more controllable plug-ins. However, you probably answer the op's question in the context of a tradional workflow of process and optical wet print where those options aren't availble and the different characteristics between film emulsions are marked. I have dozens of 35mm rolls of Fuji Superia, all long out of date, that were given away free with every film I used to take to a now defunct mini lab for processing and these films are perfectly good enough for a 'hybrid' workflow. It's ironic that with Ektar and the Portras we now have some of the best emulsions ever made. . Steve - as I noted above, I personally don't get the same editing capability out of the non pro-film stocks. That said, I don't know how it use PS and don't have a drum scanner.

Film has a fixed 'colour temperature' so if you shoot daylight film in artificial light you either use a correction filter at the time or correct it later in scanning or printing. It's got nothing to do with whether or not your box of film says 'pro' or how much you pay for it. I'm struggling to understand what you're trying to get at here. James - my examples were simply a response to a request to show how portra doesn't make skin an ugly orange in artificial light. And I didn't use filters or make material WB adjustments in them. I am not trying to \"get at\" anything with this thread. I constructed a thesis and then posed a question. So far, the only answer that makes sense to me is that a person may want to use non-pro film to attain an amateur cheap drug store look (or as some might characterize as a traditional non-clean old fashioned mainstream film look). That is fine as far as it goes, but it isn't a mainstream answer IMO. I cannot say that I agree with the qualification \"drug-store look\"for film as such. The look you refer to is more generated by the processing than by the film. The main difference between Pro film and Consumer film is the greater attention to the colour response curve between the film batches and better attention to controlling the ripening process of the emulsion. Consumer films are made to have less rigorous colour fidelity control and can be stored longer in adverse conditions because of wider tolerances. Obviously each film, be it pro or consumer, will have its own character. That is a purely personal matter of taste, and there is no need to regard a photographer who prefers for instance Kodak Gold (which I personally rather dislike) as somehow inferior or not \"worthy of his gear\". Rather disrespectful in my book to do so. For instance, the only Ilford films marked \"professional\" are the three Deltas. But nobody in his right mind would call somebody using FP4+ or XP2Super in incompetent photographer. Jaap - please don't put words in my mouth. I am not criticizing or disrespecting a person or his or her photography acumen by what film he or she uses. I really think that you, with your heavy hand, have lambasted me unfairly. I am simply questioning the logic and rational of using the most expensive 35mm film gear to use non-pro film with the purpose of making amateur-looking old drug store film photos. Shiva gave me an answer which is that he likes the rangefinder mechanism. I could quibble with how he could save a lot of money and buy a different much cheaper brand of rangefinder to get the same sensation.

So I think people need to avoid mixing issues. I may be questioning logic and cost-beneficial nature of using non-pro COLOR film; but I am in no way suggesting that people who use such film are inferior in any way shape or form - or criticizing them personally for doing what they do. I make irrational purchases and decision every single day. I do it b/c I want to and it makes me happy. This thread is simply about identifying the degree to which, as a purely objective matter, it is cost-beneficial to use non-pro film in this current environment, taking into account all of the factors that I very clearly laid out in my initial post.

I've used them over a period of nearly 40 years in college darkrooms, newspaper darkrooms, amateur darkrooms, and community darkrooms, and my own darkroom. Any problems with the Paterson reel have tended to only emerge recently, and the reel hasn't changed. Any individual problems with technique are ramped up because of the internet and the need for instant gratification. If at first you don't succeed complain about it and say it's rubbish. But just imagine all those people who don't complain about the Paterson reel, who still use them in pro darkrooms, college darkrooms, and amateur darkrooms, it is by far the (silent) majority of darkroom users. Steve It's certainly not instant gratification I'm after. I've been using these reels for months without issue. It's not as if I don't know how to load them or use them. I didn't just pop off the first minute I had some problem...that's what's so frustrating. I began having issues where I had none before so I suspected that they weren't clean enough or that there was some build up or something. (since nothing else in the chain was different than before) and as I said at the first post...I've tried it all and nothing helps, which baffles me. I'm willing to try anything that will fix this issue, just let me know what it is. As the previous poster said; some folks make it work effortlessly, some folks can never get them to be reliable and there is no pattern that emerges. Some folks clean them religiously, some don't, some have to use lots of tricks just to get them to load without issue, some don't worry about it and never clean them or take care and they work fine. There is not a real discernable pattern, but lots of folklore out there.

(since nothing else in the chain was different than before) and as i said at the first post...i've tried it all and nothing helps, which baffles me. i'm willing to try anything that will fix this issue, just let me know what it is. as the previous poster said; some folks make it work effortlessly, some folks can never get them to be reliable and there is no pattern that emerges. some folks clean them religiously, some don't, some have to use lots of tricks just to get them to load without issue, some don't worry about it and never clean them or take care and they work fine. there is not a real discernable pattern, but lots of folklore out there. for myself, -----> i !!!  spent tons of time surfing all kinds of forums -----> to !!!  figure out what -----> i !!!  -----> could !!!  -----> do !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  them work, and -----> i !!!  found that there was no pattern....nothing -----> i !!!  -----> could !!!  point -----> to !!!  that would fix the problem...as the title said...-----> i !!!  tried it all. i was far from crying at the first sign of trouble...far from it. if you've got a solution, by all means...please share it.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105144, "year": "2016"}, {"autor": "Martin B", "date": "2016-04-20 14:49:00", "content": "So far I made good experience with my dual development using Rodinal and Xtol.

Used to shoot film in high school when I didn't really pay attention to photography as a medium, just a tool to keep some memories. Then, years later fell in love in video production and bought the canon 5dmk2 (that I finally sold two weeks ago). Having that camera helped me learn very fast so I started both shooting music videos and do photography, events and anything really. Not saying that I am a pro, I just get by doing projects I really like and fitting my hobby to become my second best work skill. My \"real job\" is leather craft. I have a small workshop here in Zagreb, Croatia. We used to make a lot of high quality stuff for police and security agencies, but I have expanded my field to a lot of custom work (custom stuff for harley bikes, musicians and lately photographers). That way the creative juices are always flowing. Combining high quality standards, durability and cool designs gets you long way... Of all my friends I got stuck on digital cameras for the longest time. Cause they used film for fun and research, while I was more or less working with my cams. At some point I did not know where the work stops and I needed a step back, slower gear... Manual focus lenses were the first slower gear. Every time I would travel to UK my camera bag was heavier and bigger and the basic kit I really needed was so simple. That I have solved with Sony a7s. A really cool little camera for work, but still the colors are a big problem there... This summer I finally decided to get a film camera for a trip my girlfriend and I was planning. We bought an old olympus OM10. We went to Tre Cime, Italy, and hiked a lot around Dolomites. We used both the canon and olympus and were so excited to get home and develop all the rolls. When we did that and compared the pics to the digital ones I just felt like all the time I was messing around in raw converter I was actually looking for this film photo. And not just that, a lot of the colors were not even present in the digital pics... The digital ones had more detail and they seem sharper and so, but film is something else... To cut the long story short. I have decided to get a decent film camera and Leica was my first choice along with the Hasselblad 500... Hass lost due its size. A couple weeks ago I decided to sell my canon to get some more traveling money (as I am going to USA for a month, to shoot pics and do some video) and a couple days later Leica M3 from 1955. knocks at my door.

Is it fair to say that you are still experimenting and coming into your own with respect to your optimum workflow and that the jury is still out as to whether ultimately you will use more of the pro-film stocks or stick with the non pros? (James posted as I write this) The difference between \"professional\" and \"consumer\" films is/was mostly about marketing and distribution channels. And by marketing, I don't mean just a sham to kid people - although that plays a small role. Technically, there is very little difference between, say, Fuji Provia 100 and Sensia 100 (as was). I mean, E6 and C-41 are pretty precise processes in which you have to combine specific chemical dye coupler A (film) with developer chemical Z to get cyan. You can't really source a different chemical B instead of A, to make the film \"cheaper\" - or you don't get any dye at all. But - Sensia was sold in large orders to chain stores where it sat on shelves for months, by one part of Fuji's sales force - and Provia is sold by different sales reps, in smaller orders, to a different customer base (pro-oriented stores) that could keep it refrigerated. All films age continuously, reaching a \"peak\" of quality (color accuracy, primarily) some time after it rolls off the coating machine. Consumer films were shipped \"unripe\" direct from the factory, on the assumption that 8-20 weeks sitting on a Walgreens'/Bootes' shelf before purchase would take care of the \"ripening.\" Pro films (in their heyday) were held back by the manufacturer until test rolls showed they had reached that peak, and then refrigerated to minimize any further ages before shooting. (The old Paul Masson/Orson Welles \"We will sell no wine before its time\" idea.) Additionally, each batch of \"pro-packaged\" film was shipped with unique data sheets, that would recommend an exact ISO, and color-correction filter recommendations (based on factory test rolls) - for that specific batch. E.G. Ektachrome 100N - \"This batch - ISO 80, use a 10M CC filter\". (Part of the idea of \"pro-packs\" was that the photographer knew that all 5 or 50 or 250 rolls had come off the same machine sequentially, and had consistent \"inconsistencies\" within that package. You could shoot 20 rolls or 100 sheets of 4x5 of - say - heavy machinery, and know that the \"Caterpillar Yellow\" or \"John Deere Green\" would look identical in all of them**). It is the smaller volumes and additional handling and the expectation of consistency (not quality per se) that make Pro films more expensive. The lines have been blurred even more with the economies required today. Even before the digital onslaught and \"peak film,\" Kodak reorganized all B&W film in 1998 to fall under the management of the \"professional division\" that handled E6 films. B&W as a product line was already too small to rate its own sales force. No practical change to the film itself - they just slapped the word \"Professional\" on all the boxes, not just TXP 320. ____________ ** Those companies are absolutely anal about how their \"colors\" appear in media. My college photo classes were in Illinois, and you could not pass the commercial photo classes unless you could nail those colors perfectly in your pictures. --img--  Thanks, Adan.

It gives some reassuring tactile feedback that the film is still loading onto the reel and makes it feel easier to pause if things get awkward/cack-handed in there. I make sure a thumb remains there, or go back there if I stop (to trim end of film etc.) I find it makes it a lot easier to always know where the entry point to the reel is, losing sense of that makes it more awkward. (For me) it's only when there's a difficult moment of worrying that the film is slipping between the reels/losing sense of where the recess slots/bearings are that there could be a problem. When my hands lose sense of what's happening in there, it can make things awkward, I might overcompensate and <<pop>> there really is a problem. I just stick with the intended motion of the reels, sometimes have to go a little slow but generally they really really want to do what they were designed for. Hot sticky hands/film is the only real bugbear, but if it gets too hot just stop, cool off and return refreshed. Did you go back to using a dud roll in daylight to watch what you are doing? That would be my suggested solution. Back to basics, take it slow, stop and set things down in the tank with lid on if you find it getting awkward, not like you're in a rush or anything. Slow and steady wins the race. If the reels work fine in daylight, there's no reason at all that they shouldn't be working correctly in the bag.

As far as grain goes I think it's a question of putting first-things-first when seeing a photograph by another person. What is the photo saying to me when I look at it, so is it a powerful or intriguing picture. Then does the grain help or hinder because the grain, or lack of it, is part of the language you are using to communicate with. So have the choices of film and development and printing and burning and dodging been made well to create a balanced sophisticated image? As far as grain goes I think it's a question of putting first-things-first when showing a photograph to another person. The first thing is I make a choice about the film (and camera) I use because I know in advance it is a vital part of the language I'm interested in using. I chose the film because I knew where I am going and what could be there. And then I try to make an image that has some sort of quality and that hopefully justifies my initial decisions. For example an author doesn't start writing a Mills and Boon style romantic fiction and halfway through turn it into a repair guide for a Ford Cortina. So stick with the plot, stick with the choice of film and what it means to the image. And yes, some potentially good photographs I see on my day out won't work very well because the film is wrong, and this is one of the fundamental points of using film instead of digital.
