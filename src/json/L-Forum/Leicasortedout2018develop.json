I\u2019ve recently culled through six years of photos for a Christmas gift, most shot indoors, between ISO 640 and 1250, and have an observation based on my photos. Shoot at 640 and you can push in Lightroom 2.5 stops, for an effective ISO of 3200. Shoot at 1250, and the phots just don\u2019t look as good, even if you push only 1.5 stops, again to an effective ISO of 3200. This is true whether on-screen or in 4x6 prints. My photos shot at ISO 1250 and pushed 1.5 stops are generally inferior to my photos shot at 640 and pushed 2.5 stops in Lightroom. But, the 640 shots are completely usable up to an effective 3200. The culprit seems to be chroma noise and color fidelity. No matter what I did, 1250 pushed to 3200 yielded weird and spotty color, something not present in the 640 photos pushed to 3200. The 640 images had noticible luminance noise but it was very tight and random fairly much like film grain, but they demonstrated very little if any chroma noise.

Consequently, in my experience the ME is not a camera that is EFFECTIVELY limited to ISO 640 or even 800.

This shot was from the second batch I've ever developed. More/stronger inversions should increase contrast (and perhaps increase the grain a little).I usually invert quite energetically, following the standard pattern of continuous inversi\u00f3n for one minute then four to five inversions each minute thereafter. However, small variations in the inversion pattern have neve seemed to make much difference. Maybe you just need to develop the film for slightly more time or increase the exposure a fraction?And if you are not wet-printing, there is plenty of scope to adjust things in post-processing, particularly if the negatives look good before they are scanned... Thanks for the input on inversions. I plan to do some post-processing but wanted to show the shot before I do so I could get input on the raw shot. HP5+ is not a fine grain fim generally speaking. In my opinion a different agitation wouldn\u2019t bring any improvement for that. You can try another developer like Microphen as well, but do not expect any fine grain results. It\u2019s a wrong film for that Thanks. I'll stick with current film and chemistry for a while until I get the hang of things. I mainly posted the questions so I don't learn bad habits. If you had been printing the image with an enlarger you would have chosen a harder paper grade to print on if you wanted more contrast. Yes, it's true, decisions needed to be made in the 'good old days'. It's a shame Lightroom won't let you do something similar, like an 'Auto Contrast' button if you want your decisions automated, or a slider to adjust contrast. To me the negative looks fine in terms of 'fresh out of the scanner' contrast. All the tones are there and all that needs doing is to adjust them, if only. You are never going to get fine grain from HP5, in this image it looks normal considering. Thanks for your input. I appreciate knowing that you believe this shot is representative of what the film can do. Ummm.. My Lightroom has contrast, highlights, shadows, blacks, whites, clarity and dehaze sliders. Why can't it control contrast and tonal scales? I'll post a post-processed shot with some minor adjustments. After scanning a B&W negative (no matter which film), you often have to slightly add more contrast to the final digitized image. Sometimes level adjustments are also beneficial. Regarding grain, this one looks pretty good to me for an HP5+ 400 film photo - still a lot better than Tri-X IMO --img-- . For lower grain, you could use Xtol developer which is rich in sulfites suppressing more severe grain formation. If this is still too much, switch to FP4+ 125 film - one of my favorite B&W films so far. Thanks for believing the grain looks ok. Small differences in agitation don\u2019t matter. Just be consistent \u2013 that does matter. I agitate constantly for the first 30 or so seconds. I then agitate for 10 seconds every minute \u2013 this generally means 4 inversions. I usually tap the tank on the sink just in case there are any bubbles. I also don't fill that tank to the top - I want some room for the liquid to move. \u201cand made no adjustments\u201d \u2013 you have abandoned the most important tool you have in making a good picture. You need to assess from a creative perspective how the picture looks and what you want from it. In a conventional darkroom you would make a series of prints that would get you to your goal step by step \u2013 you can do the same electronically. A little more contrast should be easily achieved from any software. If your picture looks flat \u2013 fix it. \u201cmade no adjustments\u201d is like playing Mozart without tuning your violin. Straight-out-of-the-camera is almost always a mistake. No famous picture ever succeeded without a good printer behind it (and that includes digital pictures improved by software).

've -----> ever !!!  -----> developed !!! . more/stronger inversions should increase contrast (and perhaps increase the grain a little).i usually invert quite energetically, following the standard pattern of continuous inversi\u00f3n for one minute then four to five inversions each minute thereafter. however, small variations in the inversion pattern have neve seemed to make much difference. maybe you just need to develop the film for slightly more time or increase the exposure a fraction?and if you are not wet-printing, there is plenty of scope to adjust things in post-processing, particularly if the negatives look good before they are scanned... thanks for the input on inversions. i plan to do some post-processing but wanted to show the shot before i do so i could get input on the raw shot. hp5+ is not a fine grain fim generally speaking. in my opinion a different agitation wouldn\u2019t bring any improvement for that. you can try another developer like microphen as well, but do not expect any fine grain results. it\u2019s a wrong film for that thanks. i'll stick with current film and chemistry for a while until i get the hang of things. i mainly posted the questions so i don't learn bad habits. if you had been printing the image with an enlarger you would have chosen a harder paper grade to print on if you wanted more contrast. yes, it's true, decisions needed to be made in the 'good old days'. it's a shame lightroom won't let you do something similar, like an 'auto contrast' button if you want your decisions automated, or a slider to adjust contrast. to me the negative looks fine in terms of 'fresh out of the scanner' contrast. all the tones are there and all that needs doing is to adjust them, if only. you are never going to get fine grain from hp5, in this image it looks normal considering. thanks for your input. i appreciate knowing that you believe this shot is representative of what the film can do. ummm.. my lightroom has contrast, highlights, shadows, blacks, whites, clarity and dehaze sliders. why can't it control contrast and tonal scales? i'll post a post-processed shot with some minor adjustments. after scanning a b&w negative (no matter which film), you often have to slightly add more contrast to the final digitized image. sometimes level adjustments are also beneficial. regarding grain, this one looks pretty good to me for an hp5+ 400 film photo - still a lot better than tri-x imo --img-- . for lower grain, you could use xtol developer which is rich in sulfites suppressing more severe grain formation. if this is still too much, switch to fp4+ 125 film - one of my favorite b&w films so far. thanks for believing the grain looks ok. small differences in agitation don\u2019t matter. just be consistent \u2013 that does matter. i agitate constantly for the first 30 or so seconds. i then agitate for 10 seconds every minute \u2013 this generally means 4 inversions. i usually tap the tank on the sink just in case there are any bubbles. i also don't fill that tank to the top - i want some room for the liquid to move. \u201cand made no adjustments\u201d \u2013 you have abandoned the most important tool you have in making a good picture. you need to assess from a creative perspective how the picture looks and what you want from it. in a conventional darkroom you would make a series of prints that would get you to your goal step by step \u2013 you can do the same electronically. a little more contrast should be easily achieved from any software. if your picture looks flat \u2013 fix it. \u201cmade no adjustments\u201d is like playing mozart without tuning your violin. straight-out-of-the-camera is almost always a mistake. no famous picture ever succeeded without a good printer behind it (and that includes digital pictures improved by software). i'll post a post-processed shot. thanks again to all of you.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105470, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "otto.f", "date": "2018-10-04 06:37:00", "content": "I don\u2019t think you can determine ISO and developer time and strength on the basis of scans.

It's my first time with HC110 and I had difficulty deciding what dilution to use to give at least 6ml per film (3 in the tank) but also give me a long development time (I would prefer longer than 7 mins). It's interesting what you say about different meters giving different readings. Another potential problem I have is my 4 thermometers, two of which are Patterson, disagree! I think I've run it through at 250 to ensure shadow detail thinking I can always darken things in post processing. Also, I've heard people saying they've settled on 320 as the true speed of TriX so I've been reluctant to shoot it faster than that. For example, if shooting sunny 16 and it's bright sunlight, should the shutter be set to 1/500 at f16, or 1/250? So I run the whole film at 250 and try to process accordingly. I take your point though. I'm starting a new film of Neopan 400 today so I think I will set the meter to 400 and see how it develops/scans.

I Have to lift my hat to this treads topic and to your very interesting posts. Been looking to buy the working version of the 0-series by Leica and even the non working UR-serie which yours is based on. I love the hand craft and size of the UR Leica and it\u00b4s great to so one that\u00b4s dedicated to make it to a real working camera (which Leica should have done in the first place). Have you tried to shoot color with it? For me it\u2019s the first time as well that I noticed this topic. I have to say it\u2019s both interesting and enjoyable to read. I\u2019m quite curious to recent developments on project no 2.I guess it is time for an update on the construction of UR Leica Replica No.2. It is being made in Seoul at this time. Of course I am risking that no one will wish to purchase this camera. I have well documented my experience with the first Replica UR that I started using almost one year ago. I know exactly what Mr. Barnack and Ernst Leitz II experienced during the period of 1914-1920. Operating the camera is really a joy. I have used it for street photography, while hiking in the mountains, and it has become second nature to slide the cover over the lens when I wind the film. Also it is small and easily fits into my pocket. At the same time I must always be careful to check that the lens is extended fully from the body. I have also found that if I use 400 ASA film, I do not need to use an exposure meter but just open up the iris diaphragm and set the wheel on top to the slower shutter speed and the pictures come out fine. In the bright light I just do the opposite. The pictures are very sharp as the lens is the same design ass to planar lens we are all familiar with from Zeiss. I also have no problem to know when the film is used up, I just shake the body. When it riddles, all the film is exposed as the feeding spool is empty and loose in its space. I then go home and in the evening unload the camera in the dark and load the film into the developing tank. I usually develop the film after two roles are in the tank. At the same time I load new film into the UR-Camera so it is ready for the next photo trip or hike in the mountains. I have described this film loading procedure before on the forum. Right now I have my first color film loaded and have taken half the roll. I am also having the second Camera made. It took a while to find the original lens at a decent price, and find a IIIa Camera cheap, and find on eBay another UR Leica Dummy at a reasonable price. My camera craftsman is now putting it all together and I expect to have it next month. Then I will put it on the forum buy and sell to see if there is any interest. Of course I will not post it until I have tested it and found that it is as good as my first copy. I am risking that someone is interested in such an unconventional but historic Camera. I was very pleased with the discussion found in the Ulf Richter Book Oskar Barnack-From the Idea to the Leica. It was recently reissues issued in 2017 by LHSA in an English translation by Rolf Fricke. It is the best discussion I have found on the original UR lens. At the same time there was little about the internals of the Camera. For instance the way in which the Camera tells you how many pictures are left on the camera. My example does not tell you this number. Also there is little about the film winding mechanism except to say that it is done by a wire cable. We did not use a wire cable, we used the gears from a III or standard Leica Camera in our sample. We felt that this was a better solution to this mechanism. I was a little discouraged that so few people responded to my Forum discussion of the Camera. I thought there would be more Forum questions but that may only mean that I have answered all the questions. As soon as I have color pictures developed, I will post them here. I plan to go to the 50 year gathering of the LHSA at Wetzlar next fall so I look forward to sharing this camera with others at that time.

I have just purchased an UR and also a Null Series. Both are currently aboard jets approaching from different sides of the World. I eagerly await using the Null, and the prospect of an operational UR is VERY enticing! I must say your images are stunning! Who would believe \u201cthat\u201d camera produced them, but of course it IS a Leica, with a Leica Lens. Has Mr. Kim expressed a desire to perform this conversion on another? I\u2019d imagine he\u2019s getting familiar with the process....now I must ask a silly question here, is UR pronounced \u201cOar\u201d, or You\u2019re\u201d? I will first try to answer the question about the pronunciation of UR. I pronounce it \u201cYou\u2019re\u201d. But I defer this question to a speaker of the German Language as it stands for a German word and they pronounce the alphabet differently than we English do. Yes, Mr. Kim has asked me about more conversions and that is why I am having him make another on the assumption that someone else would like to have an operating UR Leica. I love the camera and it is my favorite film camera. I love the way it operates, its construction and size, and its excellent resolution. I too was surprised with the final pictures and so much so that I started developing all my films as I couldn\u2019t wait for the developed pictures from the photo shop in Seoul. I continue to take pictures and recently developed some excellent examples of what this 100 year old Leitz Summar 42mm lens is capable of. It is a wonderful feeling to experience what Barnack and Ernst Leitz experienced. My only question is why didn\u2019t Wetzlar produce the camera back in 1914 when they learned what a fine camera they had. Maybe that is because the camera design was ahead of the available movie film (or was it the war?). What I refer to is the \u201cLag factor\u201d. The optics of the camera was ahead of the available film. Now we are able to appreciate the full capability of the camera because modern film is finer grained and much faster than film available then. Of course my inspiration in this project was the pictures taken soon after the UR Camera was made.

It is inspiring and illuminating. Your thoughts on the latent images, undeveloped for so long, and containing pictures of loved ones, reminded me of something that I'd almost forgotten - and I'm so glad you reminded me. This also fits well into the nature, I believe, of palimpsest. When Mum passed away in 2005 - Dad had already passed away - my brother and I and our families had the rather sad task of sorting things in their home - our old family home of many years. Mum was one who was loathe to get rid of anything so this was quite a big task. Anyway, amongst all the other stuff, in the loungeroom Sue and I came across an old Kodak folding autographic camera - the kind that took one of the weird film sizes like 127 or something. Through the red window at the back we could see there was an unfinished film in it, so Sue suggested kind of jokingly that she take my picture right there in the loungeroom as a kind of memento. We were living overseas at the time and things were a bit hectic - I guess I must have taken the film back with me to Fiji and developed it there. On the resulting negative sure enough there was I, on the threshold of turning 50 in the picture Sue had taken; now cue the music from the Twilight Zone - because a couple of frames earlier - there too was I, only this time in my late teens/early twenties. In the same room! Mum must have taken it at some stage and we'd forgotten all about it and she obviously hadn't used the camera again nor had the film developed. I guess that qualifies as a palimpsest. Yes, I know, photos or it didn't happen. I will search unflinchingly now until I find those negatives! Well, I found the negatives. A few of the above details were a little askew. It turns out that the photo I thought Sue had taken of me was in fact the other way round - I took a photo of her - and it was most likely in 2008 which is when I've recorded I developed the film. And in the original one of me from the 1970s (#3 on the roll of HP4 - Sue's photo is #9) it appears as though I took a self portrait. Still, the couple of photos, on the same roll taken probably 30 years apart, makes quite an interesting diptych.

(translation: the speed of a film is that \"ISO\" that will produce \"normal\" shadow detail with \"normal\" development and a \"normal density range\" to the whole negative) .....then yes, it is technically a myth. No amount of pushed developing of TX exposed at 1600, will result in the same or \"right\" amount of shadow detail as TX shot at 400 and developed normally. For the same reason already noted - additional development is multiplicative. It will mess up that M=0.1/N=0.8 density relationship. Some compensating techniques or developers can squeeze out the absolute maximum amount of shadow detail to meet the ISO test, but not really more than 1/2 stop or so (ISO 640, maybe) to satisfy the ISO definition. Silver photography is magical, but it can't fight physics. Not enough photons = not enough silver. _________________ HOWEVER, if your standard is \"a usable picture in dim light,\" you can throw the ISO technical definition out the window, and just use the definition \"I got a usable picture.\" And in that case it is not so mythological. Ideally, one would call it an EI (exposure index) rather than an ISO (since it doesn't meet the ISO definition). Ideally, a \"good push\" would mean that a gray-card gray (not a shadow tone) comes out with about the same silver density as an unpushed negative, and about the same total amount of silver in the negative, but redistributed (less than normal in the shadows, about normal for a gray-card gray, and more than normal in the highlights). A \"heroic push\" as in the sample below, means a negative that with \"heroic\" measures in the darkroom (high-contrast paper, dodging, burning, maybe ferricyanide bleaching) can still produce a final picture. Just barely enough silver in the film - with any amount of film development - to coax out the necessary tonal distinctions to reveal the subject. I shot with a 28mm f/3.5 lens, under the \"available darkness\" of one 500-watt floodlight 40 meters/yds from the subject (back over my shoulder). I didn't really \"pick\" an EI for my TX - I just shot to avoid camera shake; 1/15th at f/3.5. Then I took an incident meter reading (which showed that that exposure in that light was about equivalent to EI 4000). I then just developed the film for \"infinity\" (30 minutes or so), and accepted the very thin neg that resulted (see simulated neg densities in the \"negative\" version). Definitely not really ISO 4000, or even close, according to the amount of shadow detail/density the ISO standard calls for - but just enough mid-tone/highlight density for a dramatic picture. In any case, you will start to see the classic \"charcoal and chalk\" look of pushed film with more than a 1-stop \"push\" - a few mid-tones that are \"about right,\" with increasingly inky black shadows and nearly blank white highlights everywhere else.

I started shooting film again about 4 years ago and meanwhile shoot more film than digital. But the main reason why I went back to film is that I can now develop all film by myself. If I had to send out each film to have it developed and scanned, it would be a very expensive and probably not worthwhile hobby. For me key with film is to do as much by yourself as you possibly can - starting from rolling your own 35 mm films from a 100' roll (reduces the price for a 36 frame cartridge about 50-70%) to scanning and potentially even printing with an enlarger setup.

The labeling of the bottles might be a bit off - for B&W processes no bleach is needed but either water or stopper fluid after the development step instead.

The used iron EDTA complex for bleaching is much more stable now than the formerly cyanide based one - so Blix now lasts for quite long.

I do keep all solutions at the same temperature, storing 2 gallons of de-ionized water with the stock solutions for mixing and film rinse (using the Iilford 3-change method of washing instead of running water, as tap water temperature gets pretty high here in summer). So my processing may be anywhere in the range of 68 to 78 degrees F. Thanks, Tom. What you said in the first line of your question is the way to go, \u201ckeep it basic and by the book\u201d. You do not say what film or developer you are using but either one probably gives you the time for the normal temperature of 20c. Ilford films give a chart of time adjustments for different temperatures which I have found useful in the summer. You can probably find the chart on the web and it might well be the same for any developer and film as I think it is a purely chemical reaction question? If you can keep your stop and fix temperatures within a few degrees of the developer that will help. You want to avoid any sharp increase or drop from one bath to another. I do not think you need to worry about the wash water increasing in temperature during the wash time, the gradual increase in temperature will just help the film to wash quicker. I do not think there will be any difference in quality of the negatives providing the temperature range is not too wide or has a dramatic jump between one bath and the next. The days of reticulated grain are long gone I hope. The last time I saw wrinkled emulsion was developing Ferannia colour slide film back in the 70\u2019s. Thanks, P. I use Ilford DD-X and either FP4+ or HP5+, always at box speed. The smaller the film the less tolerance you\u2019ll have for temperature fluctuations in the developer. The leeway varies per film too. Stopping and fixing a little bit warmer won\u2019t harm. If it gets too hot you can get reticulation (crackles in the emulsion), but that will start only above 30 Celsius I guess. It also depends on your end product: are you developing to scan or for a wet print, AAD or AAA? In my experience scanning is more forgiving. In wet printing you can choose a lower grade paper with multicontrast filters if the negative is too hard, but in general a relatively soft negative is a better starting point in the search for the best contrast for your subject. A variation of one degree Celsius won\u2019t give irreversible problems with multicontrast papers. Thanks, Otto. I shoot only 35mm. I suppose I develop to scan but like to think I could send film to a pro lab for wet prints if I have something special. I don't have a darkroom. In summary, it sounds like using a Massive Development chart or app and adjusting for temperature of chemicals is not a problem.

What I do is to use for rins finishing destilled water a a last step for approximately 15 minutes and then I use the salad spinner to remove the rest. No water agent, no squeeze, no watermarks Agree with the post above - use distilled water from a bottle purchasable in a grocery store as final wash. Pour 250 ml of distilled water onto the reel which has still the developed film rolled inside. Pour a bit on top and on bottom of the reel, and then on the side and into the film lever. This is sufficient wo rinse off most of the hard/regular water drops. Then hang the film to dry, don't squeeze. Simply let the drops evaporate or rinse off. Ray, your issue is only in part due to rinsing. It would be best to also mix your chemistry in distilled water. Mixing the chemistry in destilled water (what is generally a good idea) will not prevent the film from the watermarks if using the hard tap water for rinsing Well, of course not. I wrote in addition to rinsing in distilled, also mix using distilled. I live in a hard water area as well and do get some watermarks despite using a wetting agent in the final rinse water. I hang the film up and wipe off the excess water around the sprocket holes with my wet fingers but do not wipe down the frames except to wipe off any large blobs of water, avoiding touching the emulsion. Usually you can rub off any small watermarks if they are on the back of the film once it is dry. Just did that this afternoon with a test roll in a pre-war Kodak Retina 1. The mark on your first picture looks quite big which seems unusual and the streak on the second picture does not look like a watermark. I ought to use distilled water but don\u2019t. I have got some as it was recommended for mixing pyro developer. I think the best thing to avoid them is using wetting agent in the last rinse for a minute or so before taking out the spiral. Use proper photographic wetting agent, not washing up liquid. We have an under-sink reverse osmosis filter for drinking water, so I fill a couple of 1 gallon jugs from it and store them with my darkroom chemicals. RO filtering is almost to distilled water purity, so I use it for mixing and all film rinsing and washing. For washing I use the Ilford method of 3 tank fulls with lots of inversion agitation instead of a running water wash, which saves water and has been shown to give equivalent results. Using a 1-reel stainless tank I use about a half gallon of water per roll of film. After the 3-fills Ilford wash I use a final dip in RO water with 2-3 drops of flo before hanging to dry, which helps keep droplets from forming on the film, but is so dilute it doesn\u2019t leave deposits. Not from my experience - wetting agent didn't stop watermark residues at all - I tried both with regular detergent liquid and with photographic wetting agents. They both did nothing - don't even see much difference in regard to dust accumulation on the film when drying. I found best is simply rinsing with distilled water, I am not using any wetting agent anymore. Do you have soft water, or a water softener? Soft water, but without my final distilled water rinse I will have water droplet stains on my negatives, too. Well, this was like playing a game of Clue and I've solved the mystery.

My understanding is that with semi stand development (one turn of the tank at the midpoint of the development time) the duration that the film is in the developer depends on the developer itself (and the dilution) rather than the film and speed (pushed or not). Generally. I tried stand development with a roll of 120 that I had preloaded into a tank months ago and never gotten round to developing. I totally forgot what the film was so I figured, based on what I remembered of some reading I did in the past, that stand development would solve that. I did it in HC110 for 45 mins with a turn halfway. It developed the film nicely. I was thinking, since the development time depends on the developer and not the film/speed then: 1) If I have a multi reel tank, I can put in a variety of B&W films of different brands with different box speeds and/or pushed/pulled speeds and they should all develop fine (assuming no issued with banding and streaking etc.) right? And, 2) If the answer to the above is a \"YES\", that I can develop any combination of B&W films at (almost) any combination of ISOs then, I guess that I could develop a single roll where some of the frames were shot at box and other frames pushed and others pulled perhaps. Am I right with the two statements I have made above?", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/287112-does-stand-development-work-like-this/?tab=comments#comment-3564491", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "287112-does-stand-development-work-like-this", "result": false, "Selector": "i can develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "and, 2) if the answer to the above is a \"yes\", that i can develop any combination of b&w -----> films !!!  at (almost) any combination of isos then, i guess that i could develop a single roll where some of the frames were shot at box and other frames pushed and others pulled perhaps.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105700, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "mikemgb", "date": "2018-07-26 14:58:00", "content": "I may have a similar problem, Wayne - I have some old Agfa colour film from the 1950s I'd like to process. I think the best bet is going to be stand developing - an hour in Rodinal 1:100. I'd be really interested to hear of any other ideas - I'm sure people who have tried something like this will respond. I attempt to develop every film I find in cameras in charitiy shops. Black and white always develops well, colour not so much. The oldest film I have managed to get an image from is 25 year old Fuji. Kodak films seem to degrade faster and 15-20 years is about their limit, this is in C41. I have also tried developing in black and white chemicals and never had any luck with older colour film, I have always ended up with a negative so dense it's impossible to scan. There are companies out there that can often develop films of this age but they use custom soups that for obvious reasons they don't share!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/286761-agfapan-asa100-professional-expired-1980-processing/?tab=comments#comment-3561842", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "286761-agfapan-asa100-professional-expired-1980-processing", "result": false, "Selector": "i attempt to develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i attempt to develop every -----> film !!!  i find in cameras in charitiy shops.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105726, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Martin B", "date": "2018-07-26 15:01:00", "content": " I attempt to develop every film I find in cameras in charitiy shops.

Xtol stock gave me fine grain, detail in shadows and also a flat look which was difficult to correct without ruining the skin tones (film is not digital, you can't push those sliders like on a 7D raw file).

Your images posted for HP5 split development looks amazing! Sharp, nice grain, very good separation between light, mid-tones and shadows, nothing mushy (like HP5 in straight Rodinal 1:50). Maybe can you share your recipe of split development? Something like Xtol stock or 1+1 for some% of total development time AND Rodinal 1:50/1:100 for rest of development time.

Many thanks, Bogdan Hi Bogdan, here is my recipe for HP5+ 400 at ISO 400: 20 deg C water temperature 1. Rodinal diluted 1:100 for 10 minutes. Agitate every 2 minutes. 2. 3x rinse with water for 30 seconds each time 3. Xtol diluted 1:2 for 6 minutes. Agitate every minute. 4. Stop solution for 1 minute, agitate. 5. Fixer solution for 10 minutes, agitate every minute. 6. 2x rinse with water 7. Hypo Clearing Agent wash for 2 minutes, agitate every 30 seconds. 8. Final water rinse.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/258970-dual-development-which-one-to-use-first/?tab=comments#comment-3494223", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "258970-dual-development-which-one-to-use-first", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i have a 100 feet -----> roll !!!  of hp5 at home and i developed it until now in rodinal , d76 and xtol.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 105811, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Jodad", "date": "2018-02-26 10:59:00", "content": " Hey guys.

Is there a developer that I can use to develop all of these films? I'm not in the position to buy a bunch of different devs to suit each film.
