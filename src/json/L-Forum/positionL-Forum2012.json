He thinks this could be interesting for others as well. As English is not my language, he has done highly valuable corrections which make the text really fluid and understandable. Thank you very much, Mark! Hi Mark, as you requested I have sent you some advice both for use and workflow for your 2.8/28 PC-Super-Angulon-R. Hopefully, you will find it useful. I am sure most, if not all, of what follows here is just common sense, and therefore redundant, but anyway here it goes: 1 Tripod I assume you will use the lens with the camera mounted on a tripod. This will eliminate the unavoidable small variations in camera positioning that occur when hand-held. This will also help to establish a fast and efficient technical routine (which is as broad and inclusive as possible in the sense that it is independent of any particular photogrpahic style) so that you won't need to think about the workflow every time. 2 Camera placement Initially you should try to define your image left-to-right, move around the scene you want to photograph, and adjust distance to and angle towards the subject, a well as height from ground. As always, the image is first defined in your mind, ie. deciding what you want even before having used the camera as a framing tool. This is especially important with the 28PC and M9, as without live-view you will need to review the image after having taken the photograph and then make any necessary adjustments. You first shoot in order to see what the photo will be like, and then, looking at the LCD, adjust the camera. The more experience you have with the 28mm focal length the better will be the initial positioning of the camera. Finally, you will have the right position for the camera, which is that which produces the correct geometry for the final image you want. This is a very important point so please bear with me whilst I digress to explain two possibilities. One can either be true to the geometry of the main plane of the subject (ie the true frontal view of the fa\u00e7ade of the building), or not be true to it's geometry. With the latter there is a 'shortening', or Scorzo in Italian, or Verk\u00fcrzung in German. There is only one way to produce a true frontal view, but many ways of producing a Scorzo. The Scorzo can be either a very small and almost unrecognizable departure from the true frontal view, or very large. In other words, the trapezoidal figure obtained from the original rectangle can be more or less irregular and bizarre depending on the degree of displacement from the true frontal view. The more from the side the photo is taken, the more bizarre the image and less recognizable will be the fa\u00e7ade! This is why the most commonly sought image geometry is that delivered from the true frontal view, where the orthogonality of the fa\u00e7ade is preserved, and the original rectangular front of the building becomes a true rectangle in the image. It takes some time and patience to develop the skill to achieve this more or less right from the beginning. 3 Level the Camera Align the camera with the aid of a bubble level. A 3D head is better for obvious reasons. The ideal tripod head is one that will allow a panoramic movement without losing the level, and where the panoramic movement is directly under the camera, not under the head. The Arca-Swiss d4 is the one I use precisely because of this feature. But it's not essential if you don't have it as it's only a minor inconvenience having to readjust the level after adjusting the camera for framing. It goes without saying that you will achieve the correct camera position and levelling by trial-and-error. Shoot and then go back to the LCD until you have the image you want. I find the quality of the M9's LCD to be adequate for this, but yes it could be better. Now, when the camera is correctly positioned for the image you want (from left-to-right), it is time to adjust the lens. 4 Lens Exposure and Focus Settings Meter the light with lens PC settings at zero. The diaphragm should be set to f11, but could be set to f8 if the shift is only going to be slight. There is a lever/switch on the lens that must be set to the down position - you will easily find this yourself. As the aperture setting of f11 is not variable, obviously only shutter speed (and ISO) is available to adjust for the correct exposure. I assume you are photographing landscapes and cityscapes/buildings so the focus is, by default, set to infinity. It is always worthwhile using the lens-hood. 5 Lens - Shift Settings So now let's shift! You are at ground level on the street and want to photograph a five storey building so you will need to shift the lens up. As the default lens position is for sideways shift it will need to be rotated. Personally, I like to have the knob pointing to the sky simply because it is convenient to have the f-stop and the distance scales to the right where the shutter-release is. In this way one only needs to move/look from behind the camera to the right of the lens and back again, rather than to both the left and right of the lens. Shifting is a very straightforward procedure, again done by trial-and-error because there is no live-view. If we think about it, this step is simply a means of framing up-and-down! If you are on the top of a building and want to shoot looking down the lens will obvioulsy be shifted down. However, for some strange reason I nearly always avoid correcting verticals when looking down: as I do not find verticals converging towards the ground didtrubing. You can of course shift laterally, applying the same principles as above. 6 Tips for Shift Settings a. After gaining some experience with up-down and left-right movements you can try diagonals. Diagonal adjustments will shift simultaneously through the two planes, for example right and up if the lens is shifted diagonally towards 1:30 on the clock. The example you saw in the forum was exactly this - right & up. Schneider recommends that with these combined diagonal shifts one should not shift beyond 9mm. b. There is a rule-of-thumb when working with a view camera that one should avoid shifting if tilting the lens axis more than \u00b130\u00b0 such as with a taller building. This is because the resulting image would look 'artificial' but this is not a problem with 28 PC-R because it can only shift to a maximum of 11mm. Not that this is an inconsiderable shift being nearly 50% of 24mm which is of course the short length of a 24mmx36 full-frame. It is of course possible to combine lens shifting with tilting the camera up in these more extreme situations. The shift will lessen the convergence without totally eliminating it. c. In some instances it is better to avoid a 100% correction of vertical convergence because if overdone it can appear as if a vertical convergence towards the ground is happening. The classic example is a tall building seen in such a way that it appears as a ship's prow, ie. aggresively pointing towards the camera. Because of the 'fish spine' configuration of horizontal lines, even if vertical lines are perfectly parallel, the verticals seem to converge towards the ground. This effect can be avoided easily by not trying to attempt a full 100% correction of vertical convergence. This is comparable to the 'entasis' applied by the old greeks to their temple architecture. I hope you find this helpful! Warm regards from Barcelona. Manolo Epilogue This has been written for those who want to try using a PC lens on the M9 and already believes that this is worthwhile. For those who are still to be converted I include this final reflection on: Why use a PC lens on the M9? Which is easier, using a PC lens on a DSLR or on an M9? The answer is obvious - on a DSLR. But we are not speaking about the obvious, but of a solution that is much more interesting precisely because it is not obvious! I like the M9's quality, I like it's small size, and it's the camera I own. This is an important point! I don't own a Nikon 800 or Canon 5DIII or equivalent because I don't want or need them. The price of a 2nd hand PC such as the 28 PC-R is much lower than those camera bodies. This lens is an excellent compromise - with a trade-off of what I find to be only a minor inconveninece in use, it adds only 800 gm to my bag, and is like having a very small view camera at hand. Using this lens allows me to take advantage of the M9's small size and image quality but give me the option of a PC lens. I don't consider this as being against the 'M philosophy,' but actually quite the opposite. Everything can be looked at from different or divergent (pardon the PC lens pun) point of view. As photographers, we know this very well... The combination of a M9 with a PC lens may seem bizarre at first, but it isn't if we think a little bit about it, or better yet, try it. This combination requires experience and practice, but can be very rewarding if you are willing to climb that steep learning curve.

The display of the M9/M9-P is a different display and is sourced from another manufacturer and is therefore not affected. For the M9 as for all our products, we are taking measures that we are able to service the camera for a period of at least ten years after production will stop.

Unfortunately, your camera requires parts which, due to our being even more incompetent than usual, we have failed to keep in stock and which are now unavailable here in Solms. Fortunately, we have at our disposal \"Team Hapless\" who were last involved in marketing the Digilux 3 to an unreceptive and unenthusiastic world. They have now been deployed from their usual resting position of hiding under their desks to search the world for used M8s. We always intended that these would serve as a backup source of spare parts, distributed across a wide geographic area in case of natural or man-made disaster (the latter of which naturally excludes them being kept in Solms). I am pleased to tell you that we have located a used M8 in the middle of the Sahara Desert which will provide the parts we need to repair your camera.

As it's non-coupled the parallax adjustment isn't operative. Furthermore for large lenses attached, that window's view is substantially blocked. So, in this case the rangefinder window cannot be used for either framing or focusing. In this situation the M-240's rangefinder window might as well not display framelines at all. So, just for fun, I checked out which frame lines my M9 displays when various adapters are being attached. To get a base understanding: Lever in the outward position displays framelines for 35 and 135 mm focal lengths. Lever in the vertical position displays framelines for 50 and 75 mm focal lengths. Lever in the inward position displays framelines for 28 and 90 mm focal lengths. When no lens or adapter is attached the lever is in the outward position. Furthermore the coupling pin at the top is positioned as outward as possible, corresponding to close focus. As one pushes that pin in, frame lines move from lower right to upper left. Pushed all the way in seems to correspond to infinity focus. Now, let's see what happens when I attach 5 different adapters to the M9: \u2022 NOVOFLEX LEM/LER adapter attached, lever in vertical position. \u2022 NOVOFLEX LEM/NIK-NT adapter attached, lever in vertical position. \u2022 Fotodiox LR-LM adapter attached, lever in outward position. \u2022 No Name Nikon-LM Japan adapter attached, lever in vertical position. \u2022 No Name Nikon(G)-LM adapter attached, lever in outward position.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/192591-lens-code-for-new-apo-50-f2-confusion/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-2173030", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": " in a way to me it seems to be a mute point whether framelines are displayed in the m-240's rangefinder window when a non-rangefinder coupled adapter is attached. as it's non-coupled the parallax adjustment isn't operative. furthermore for large lenses attached, that window's view is substantially blocked. so, in this case the rangefinder window cannot be used for either framing or focusing. in this situation the m-240's rangefinder window might as well not display framelines at all. so, just for fun, i checked out which frame lines my m9 displays when various adapters are being attached. to get a base understanding: lever in the outward -----> position !!!  displays framelines for 35 and 135 mm focal lengths. lever in the vertical position displays framelines for 50 and 75 mm focal lengths. lever in the inward position displays framelines for 28 and 90 mm focal lengths. when no lens or adapter is attached the lever is in the outward position. furthermore the coupling pin at the top is positioned as outward as possible, corresponding to close focus. as one pushes that pin in, frame lines move from lower right to upper left. pushed all the way in seems to correspond to infinity focus. now, let's see what happens when i attach 5 different adapters to the m9: \u2022 novoflex lem/ler adapter attached, lever in vertical position. \u2022 novoflex lem/nik-nt adapter attached, lever in vertical position. \u2022 fotodiox lr-lm adapter attached, lever in outward position. \u2022 no name nikon-lm japan adapter attached, lever in vertical position. \u2022 no name nikon(g)-lm adapter attached, lever in outward position.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 21737, "year": "2012"}], "name": "positionL-Forum2012"}
