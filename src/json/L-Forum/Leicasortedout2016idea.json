Which means we all think in ASA/ISO as we did with film, but are just learning that the idea was kept around but doesn't really actually mean anything, except that it allows us to continue making images that we can chimp, rather than drown everything out in darkness. ISO variations then do two things: keep us from blowing out highlights, and allow us to chimp effectively (focus, dof, composition, etc.), as long as we stay within the range of the CMOS, which is much greater than we think. How many stops is that sensor actually capturing then? What units could I be more efficiently using/thinking in than ISO/fStop/ShutterSpeed? Lumens? So then a whole new way - for me - of looking at capturing light: what combination of aperture and shutter speed will allow the appropriate range of lumens access to the CMOS. One of the Holy Triad of exposure adjustments appears to have been taken from us, but that's short-sighted, because what we're learning is that the CMOS effectively has a much wider range of stops than film: from, let's say, three stops below ISO200 (native sensitivity), to perhaps as many as seven stops above (ISO3200+three stops). So as long as my exposure is within those eleven stops, I should have data to manipulate - RAW files assumed - trusting that the RAW file isn't automatically discarding highs and lows just because the meter said so based on ISO/fStop/ShutterSpeed inputs (but my experience of Christmas Eve, shooting after dark, was that the meter gave up (\"I can't see nothin!\"), while the sensor kept gathering light (\"Oo: pretty!\"). Which is to say, I might help myself through the transition by shooting the M240 like an M4: no internal light-meter, because that just tricks me into old patterns: use the Lumu in my iPhone as a spotmeter dialed up to whatever ISO I like (say... max of 3200 on the M240), choose the aperture/shutterspeed combo I like, leave the M240 set on 200, and bang away.... So: ISO200, any shutter speed and aperture combo that won't blow out highlights and would capture blacks at (theoretical) ISOs up to 3200, and bob's your uncle in post-processing. What we need, really, is the metering revolution, not evolution: kill the ISO inputs, give us a meter that shows what the CMOS is capable of registering and how many stops we're exploiting with our current f/speed combo, retain the chimping capability despite exposure (a sort of temporary auto-gain for the camera display), and post-processing that acknowledges the new methods.
