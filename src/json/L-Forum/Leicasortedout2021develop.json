They already have a set of lenses, and don't want any old camera, they want a Leica so they can carry on much as before but with the convenience of digital. Possibly. I would be suprised it it's \"most\" though. I was using film, had (and still have) a Nikon FM2 and M4-P. I wanted a digital M, but skipped the 8 because it did not have the features I wanted (full frame). The M9 had all I needed, so I got one and still use it. 9 minutes ago, Anbaric said: An interesting question is whether those most allergic to video are traditional film users who are set in their ways and want nothing to do with the cinematograph, or are they perhaps younger digital natives (I hesitate to use the term 'hipsters') seeking out the rangefinder for its Purity of Essence? I'm not allergic to video or evf or ibis, etc. I just don't need it. If they do put all that in an M it's fine... as long as it doesn't get in the way of the primary function of the tool, taking pictures. If I wanted/needed the whole shebang I'd have gone for something else... in fact I did. In some curcumstanes I use my XPro-2 instead of the M as it's more suited. As far as adding it to future Ms go, it doesn't sound likely. Here's what the M10 product manager (Jesko von Oeyhausen) and Global Director of Business Unit Photo (Stefan Daniel) said on the matter: (source: https://www.reddotforum.com/content/2017/02/the-leica-m10-a-discussion-with-stefan-daniel-and-jesko-von-oeynhausen/) Quote And the decision to eliminate video? What was the thinking here? Jesko: We talked a lot to our customers to find out what the essential requirements for the new generation were. And when we talked about video we found out that most of the customers said, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Many costumers said \u201cI do care, but I don\u2019t want it.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s a certain group of costumers that really appreciate video and would miss it, but these are customers that would really want it working perfectly, with HDMI and more advanced features. So therefore, we have the SL as an option for them. When we developed the M (Typ 240) we didn\u2019t have an SL so we tried to reach a broad customer group, which we still can reach now. But with two different products, which makes sense from a product development standpoint. And with the SL, you can still use M lenses for shooting video, if that\u2019s the goal.

No digital M can give you this. Concerning development I use a changing bag so that I can spoil in the films on my daylight living room table. Quite practical accessory. I always develop my self as it is 30 mins only for one development including rinsing. All other options would take more time and I am always amazed when the film comes out of the tank. For scanning it took me some time especially on color slides to get what I saw on the slides, including color calibration with an IT target on my now old (but still very well running) Reflecta ProScan 7200. I think today I would first try to digitize with a digital camera. What then is important is to have a good lens (or full correction of its flaws like distortion and vignetting) and preferably a APS-C sensor than full frame as this sensor has higher depth of field. DOF must be higher than uneven film. In order to reduce unevenness of film I cut and put the film in the paper pouches shortly after drying and the let them under a big book during the night. Next morning the film is very even and stays so. Lab development usually gives you well curved negatives. Concerning lab scans: the are often of lower resolution and only JPG instead of TIFF or high priced. I now scan every negative with 3600dpi, independent if it seems to be a good or bad capture. So I have a full archive of my analog work. BW scan is not complicated as you do not have to care about colors. A scanner ha the following advantages: No uneven quality due to the digitizing lens\u2019 flaws, possibility to repair dust, scratches and marks on color film (with infrared channel scanning); this feature does not work on BW film (and Kodachrome) as the silver does not permit the use of IR scan. The disadvantage is surely the slow digitizing process. Depending on how you work this does not matter if you are using your computer during an hour for something else, like post processing the precedent film. Then one remark in the Kodak Plus-X (which I have never used): it seems that the Kodak Double X (movie film) has a similar characteristic from what I have read. I have bought a 400ft roll last year and work exclusively with this film now since. I really like it and used it until now in a range between 125 and 1000 ISO with pleasing results for my taste. You find some few examples here (developer used see tags): https://www.flickr.com/gp/149009476@N07/KSSS00 I will soon add some of my experience with this film on my website rimpl.photo which ist still under construction. This film sells at FPP in 100ft rolls as well as already canned. Cinestill also stellt this Film. Sunny 16 for me works fine in most films (double x has some less exposure latitude and requires a bit more precise metering) with little aid sometimes from my light meter app on my smartphone when light conditions change or just to verify.

Of course. The lens was a 50 Summicron, and there had been rumours of a replacement, so I took it at face value. I wandered around outside taking a few shots, and then sat down and put them on my computer. I'm not sure that my jaw actually dropped, but I was certainly gobsmacked, the images had a real clarity with wonderful bokeh, they just pinged out at me. Of course, this was my first sight of the 50 APO Summicron M, and to give myself credit, I immediately realised how special it was, even when expecting something 'standard'. Before that my only experience of APO lenses was the 75 APO Summicron M, which was already a firm favourite of mine. That lens also combines creamy bokeh with real precise sharpness. Every time I see someone use the word 'sterile' in conjunction with this lovely lens it hurts afresh! Since that day we have seen a whole range of APO Summicrons for the L mount, and these also have been characterised by this combination of wonderful bokeh and stunning sharpness. Absolutely the opposite of 'sterile' these lenses produce a consistent and lovely look, not harsh at all, just right. Now we have the fourth Apochromatic M lens (after the 90, 75 and 50 Summicron lenses). The APO-Summicron-M 1:2/35 Asph. I had the lens for a month from September last year. Although looking at the first shots wasn't quite such an epiphany (I was expecting to be blown away) it was still a revelatory experience! --img--  --img--  --img--  For more sample images you can read the article here: https://www.slack.co.uk/leica-35-summicron-m.html Apochromatic correction This is the term used to describe the reduction of colour aberrations in lenses, it requires special glass and is necessary if you want to produce the very best MTF figures. For many years Leitz had their own glass production facility, and it was here that early glass materials to minimise colour aberrations were developed. Walter Mandler used these in the development of the early APO lenses. The 180mm APO-Summicron was the first APO lens developed for the consumer market and was introduced in 1994. The intention was to get the best possible performance wide open, implementing APO technology to achieve this. This lens has become a legend, and now changes hands for \u00a37,000 to \u00a38,000 in good condition. During the 90s Leica made a number of other APO R lenses including the 180 f2.8 Elmarit-R, the f4 280mm APO-Telyt-R, and the 400mm and 560mm APO-Telyt-R modules. These APO glass elements are not easy to handle during production and during this period Leica became experienced in implementing the technology, The first APO lens for the M system was the 90mm APO-Summicron-M Asph, released in 1998. Here they combined Apochromatic correction in combination with newly developed aspherical surface polishing processes. The 75 mm APO-Summicron-M Asph was released in 2005, and in addition to APO and Aspherical technologies, it included a floating element, just like it's brother lens the 50 Summilux Asph. The third APO M lens was the 50 mm APO-Summicron-M, and this is the lens I referred to in my introduction, Thorsten Overgaard in his lens compendium refers to it as 'The World's best 50mm'. I think that was almost certainly true on it's release in 2012, Since then Leica have mostly been concentrating on the APO-Summicron range for the L Mount, at the time of writing 5 lenses are available: 90, 75, 50, 35 and 28mm the 24 and 21mm lenses are scheduled to appear during the next year or so. APO-Summicron-M 35mm F2 ASPH. Leica have pulled out all the stops with this lens. There are 10 elements consisting 3 Aspherical lens elements (with 4 aspherical surfaces) 6 elements using Apochromatic glass 3 elements made of glass with a high refractive index. In addition they have developed a new focusing mount capable of focusing down to 0.3m. From 0.7m to infinity is rangefinder coupled with a similar throw as other classical 35mm M lenses. From 0.7 to 0.3 metres you will need to use Live view or the EVF for focusing (or an SL camera). Remarkably the MTF figures for this lens are almost as good as those for the much larger SL 35mm APO, which, Peter Karbe feels, is the best 35mm lens available on the market today. The lens diameter at 53mm is the same as the 50 APO. Without the screw in lens hood the length is 40.9mm as opposed to the 50 at 47mm, with the lens hood attached it's 49mm. It weighs 305gm as opposed to the 300gm of the APO 50, so, to all intents and purposes it's the same size as 50mm. Handling Like it's sibling, the 35 is just a perfect match for an M camera, it's small and relatively light and beautifully made and finished. It has a thumb tab, but unlike the 50 it has a screw in lens hood, which is shorter than the one on the 35 Summicron Asph, more like the lens hoods on the late lamented Summarit lenses, or indeed the Leica Q. The close focus is really useful, and if you don't have an EVF with you it's easy enough to focus using the LCD. On an L mount camera it's even simpler. I think perhaps I would have liked to have a slightly more positive step when focusing closer than the coupled rangefinder, but this is really nitpicking (and it might have changed on the production lens). Image Quality Image quality is nothing short of magical; from f2 and also stopped down, it's consistent and without obvious flaws beyond a little vignetting. It's sharp right to the corners, with hardly any fall off, even at f2. As is the case with other recent APO lenses the transition between the ultra high definition in focus to creamy bokeh out of focus area is gentle and swift. Most of my test shots were with the M10-R (and all the ones in the gallery), there is no question that the 35 APO resolves well enough for the 40mp sensor (and the 48mp of the SL2). I would imagine it is future proofed against higher resolution sensors in M and L mount cameras to come. Conclusion Just like the APO-Summicron 50mm the 35mm is an expensive lens, this is because the glass is expensive and hard to make, the production is problematic and the tolerances are very tight. Making such a small lens of such good quality is not simple. Hence the cost. On the other hand, it is a lovely object, like a beautifully made wrist watch, perfect in form and function. I've been lucky enough to have had several discussions and some email correspondence with Peter Karbe about both the M and SL APO Summicrons. I think that giving up the bragging rights of wide apertures in order to make the very best quality lenses is admirable. It has the added advantage of keeping the size down. Leica has applied this philosophy over 15 years to produce 5 SL and 4 M APO Summicrons; lenses which are consistent in performance and 'look', a real asset for the serious photographer. There is a feeling amongst many photographers that modern lenses don't have a 'soul' like vintage glass; that they all look the same. I would really dispute that, and I think that these in particular have a lovely look and feel about them, quite unlike any other lenses I have used. Developing and manufacturing this 35mm lens also shows Leica's serious intentions for the M system going forwards. Perhaps this isn't a surprise, but it's nice to have it confirmed. This is a significant lens announcement for Leica, but more than that it's a lovely lens of peerless quality. Something to be used as a standard lens by the discerning photographer for years to come.

I have been a manual meter BnW film photographer forever. I love the M3 and the MP with built in metering, but it always comes down to what shutter speed and f/stop do I want to use? Over/under exposure based on the scene and the light. I also have really enjoyed using the SL and SL2 because I can use the auto metering mode with aperture priority and use the top dial to over and under expose the image. So the best of both worlds, easy base exposure set for me and then modify it appropriately. Then, I also begin playing with the Nikon F2 and the metering system with it. I noted that for a large range of shutter speeds, I think it was 1/125 second forward, the dial is variable. This means the shutter speed can operate anywhere in between the standard settings. Move it part way between 1/500 and 1/1000 and your shutter speed is anything in between. So what? Well, that means I can set the aperture and move the shutter speed dial until the meter says average grey, the shutter speed will be \u2018perfect.\u2019 I can modify with the EV +/- if I like. What I found was my negatives had great densities throughout the spectrum. This seems like what the M7 does in Auto mode with film. So, the point of my article, I have been using the R8 and R9 now for about 6 months or more and use the multi metering mode. Almost all my lenses are ROM lenses so Leica says the MM mode knows the natural vignetting of the lens and some other aspects, like focal length. The \u2018computer\u2019 compares the light to a library of sorts and uses the zones to set an exposure. What I have enjoyed is two-fold: 1) the shutter is stepless, meaning like my Nikon F2, any shutter speed in between low and high based on the light. 2) the +/- exposure is easy to adjust with the level on the back. I am sort of a purist and love BnW photography because I can develop the negs myself. But, I have found the multi metering mode not only fun, but producing great density on negatives. It\u2019s the extra 1/10th stop that just makes post processing much easier. What I find is that reducing exposure or highlights on negatives can bring about a little more grain than I like.

From these images, I have developed a great interest of trying to identify the myriad of towns and cities that are depicted. In most cases I don't have much to go on - a monument, fountain or statue; the architecture of the buildings; business names that hopefully still exist, road signs directing to other towns and so forth. The one constant that seems most prevalent in the majority of the images are churches and their steeples. The problem is just about every town in Germany and Austria had at least one church; so, to narrow the search by that variable can be just as difficult as trying to identify a location by an obscure landmark. I was wondering if any of the German/Austrian forum memmbers know of, or can recommend a reference book that shows churches throughout Germany/Austria down to the town level.

I have the Epson V700, but just find it so slow. I intend to use my Durst 670 enlarger as a copy stand and buy the Kaiser Plano light box and see if the various negative holders from Epson and Intrepid I already hold do the trick. I was surprised by the lens specs for the Sigma 70 and 105 that the closest focusing was approx 29cm for both (in my naivety I expected macro lenses to be able to focus quite close up) and was thinking that I may well need the 105mm lens to fill the frame with a 35mm negative or will the 70mm along with the cropped sensor do? I don't think the telescopic focussing of the 70mm will be an issue for me. Or is there a spacer (non-Leica!) available that will allow me to use one of my M lenses with the L to M adapter ? Or would a L to M39 adapter with a 50/80mm enlarging lens work? I was going to ask how I could calculate the correct combination of lenses, adapters and focal lengths etc but I don't think there would be enough time or space ...

The Monochrom's files are really flat straight out of the camera and to my eye have no punch or emotional impact. I don't use SilverEfx for any of my monochrome files. Instead, I developed a Lightroom CC Classic import preset for my M10M DNGs. I'd say this took around a month or two working with the camera and figuring out how best to achieve the look I enjoy.

Being right in front of the lens means that the filter itself is way out of focus and any degradation due the refraction through the periphery of the filter is absolutely minimal. I always use a filter purely as protection and often have to remove marks from stuff which would otherwise have ended up on the lens. Once, I was a firm believer in protecting the front element of my lenses with UV/Haze filters. However, while I was conducting a test between two 35mm high-resolution black & white films (H&W Control VTE film and Kodak High Contrast Copy film), I changed my belief. During the test, I shot a tripod-mounted camera with the mirror locked up and with a UV/Haze filter. I just happened to take a few test shots without a UV/Haze filter. After I developed the film and enlarged the images, I noticed that even a high-quality UV/Haze filter caused some loss of image quality. Since I needed to capture as much detail as possible in my large prints (16x20 inches and larger), I removed the UV/Haze filters from all my lenses. Since then, I no longer used protective filters on my 35mm lenses, my medium format lenses, or my large format lenses. Since then, the only time I used a UV/Haze filter was when I actually needed the filter to reduce UV light (such as when shooting film at high altitudes or in snow) or when I needed to protect my lens from damage while shooting in a hostile environment (such as when shooting mud wrestling or food fights, or when shooting in storms or in industrial plants, or when shooting dirt bike and horse races).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/324866-uv-filter-for-m-lenses/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4283109", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "324866-uv-filter-for-m-lenses", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "after i developed the -----> film !!!  and enlarged the images, i noticed that even a high-quality uv/haze filter caused some loss of image quality.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4794, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Shu_downunder", "date": "2021-05-26 13:58:00", "content": " 7 hours ago, Hans-Dieter G\u00fclicher said: Look for a professional cleaner and pay some money.

I shoot it because I was tired of sitting in front of a computer, endlessly staring at a screen and dicking around with post-processing software. I'm also sick and tired of constantly having to charge batteries for every single thing I touch. Film divorces me from computers, screens and software and lets me focus on photography. I pick up my M-A or M4 and it's ready to shoot. My camera isn't a computer with a lens bolted to the front. No menus, settings, screens, etc. Developing and darkroom printing my photos also gives me a much-needed break from computers and digital everything. I find it soothing and satisfying to work with my hands to produce a print rather than endlessly tweaking an image in Lightroom or Photoshop and finally pressing a button to have it spit out of a printer. There's little satisfaction in that for me personally. And no, I'm not a Luddite, I'm a Software Engineer by trade. But I have absolutely no desire to spend my free time like I do my professional time, chained to a computer. Film sets me free! Good points. We as a species have become too digitized IMO.

Anyhow, to the question, I find medium format digital has helped me get to a more filmic look much more easily than 35mm (the latter being digital Ms and SL2). In my case I got a GFX100S, but I really liked the rendering of others such as the Hassie X1D. What the medium format digital gives me is smoother transitions (better differentiation of shades of colour, and more smooth transitions between highlights/shadows), and it is this aspect that makes it easier for me to get to the look of film. Also, things like a Black Pro Mist filter can help (I often use the 1/4 now) to add some glow in the highlights, which looking at my E6 often seems to occur with film. I have a GFX-R that I now use only for scanning. I too greatly prefer the Hassy's renderings. But to my mind, there is no digital rendering (except maybe those of the Foveon sensors) quite as beautifully filmic as the Leica S.

I noticed it about a year ago (bought it new in January 2020), until then, I didn\u2019t have any issues at all. First, I thought it was a faulty film canister, but I tried fresh film from different brands and manufacturers, and I was having the same issue so, as the camera was in warranty, I decided to send it to Wetzlar. 3 months after, I received the camera and, after a couple of test rolls, I was having the same issue, so I thought it might be my process, as I develop my film at home, and I was assuming that Leica is a serious company and they did their job. Last April, I shot a roll of film colour, sent it to the lab and there were no issues at all. I had a darkroom hiatus during the Summer and last weekend I developed three rolls: two of them shot with the MP and one with the M4-P. I used a different tank as I used to, a new changing bag and fresh chemicals, just in case, and I had the same issue in one of the rolls I shot with the MP (the other one was shot at night). The roll shot with the M4-P came out perfectly exposed and clean of light leaks, so I can discard my developing process. I see that some leaks follow a pattern and sometimes the sprockets also generate some patterns, so maybe it happens in the take-up spool area? Has anyone experienced something like this? It\u2019s driving me crazy and I\u2019m thinking about sending it again to Wetzlar before the warranty expires, but that would mean another three months of repair service and not knowing where the issue comes from. I\u2019ve attached some images of my negatives. The positives are shot before sending the camera to Wetzlar. The negatives are form the last roll I developed yesterday.

One thing to consider is the 'leak' is very hard edged but with some falloff across the frame, but it's perfectly reproducible as an exact replica, unlike generalised leaks that vaguely come in from one direction.

It sounds like the first test to do. Quick & easy. Last night, after developing the last test roll, I did it. The light comes from the upper side of the winding sprocket shaft next to the frame window. Here's a picture where the light leak can barely be seen when I put the exposed film inside the body. --img--  9 hours ago, 250swb said: So it wasn't the lenses, it is some other variation of what you are doing in testing, such as the brightness of the ambient light around the camera, the time between frames and winding the film on, etc., the time it takes for a light leak to make a difference in other words. It definitely isn't the lenses, as the light may come from the shutter button/advance lever area or the front rewind-clutch lever as Andrew says. 9 hours ago, adan said: A couple of points. 1) I had a light leak in an M4-P, back when they were current (about 1982). Cutting to the chase - the light was leaking in around the front rewind-clutch lever (the one to be flipped to R to rewind film). And shining right through the camera body to the film in the gap between the winding sprocket shaft and the takeup spool. Which conforms to Joanone's experience that the leak covers parts of both the frame behind the shutter - and the previous (already advanced) frame. It turned out that the lever on the front was standing away from the hole through which the lever's shaft enters the camera, and so the light was able to get in through that gap. --img--  (scale and gaps exaggerated for clarity) A machinist in the hospital where I worked was able to grind a mm or two off the back of the lever's shaft, which allowed the lever to sit tight against the camera and seal the gap. Easy fix: remove screw - take lever off camera - apply to grinding wheel - re-install lever and screw. 2) Light leaks are, like any exposure, cumulative. A few seconds in the path of a tiny leak may not expose the film enough to show up, whereas an hour's delay between exposures, with the film sitting in one place the whole time, may show lots of fogging. That was how I narrowed down the location of this intermittent leak, By realizing that the fogged frame was always a picture made just before a long pause in shooting (I always wind on right after a picture, but then the film may be stationary for minutes or hours or days, until the next picture). Then I just eyeballed the camera through the open back in that area - and spotted the tiny glint of light coming from 'way up in the top front of the body. Wow! Thanks so much, Andrew for such a great contribution, it clarifies a lot of things! So, here's an image showing one of the leaks from the last test roll I developed yesterday. Considering that I shot this roll faster than I normally do, (I'm a slow shooter and it takes me about a month to finish a roll) and, as Andrew said, light leaks are cumulative and I also I always wind on right after a picture, there is a leak problem in the camera body. --img--  Taking into consideration that I have the feeling that we all here are doing a better job trying to spot the origin of the issue than the person who was in charge of repairing my camera in Wetzlar, I'm going to send the camera back before the warranty expires (next January 22). It is true that the shot a few frames after repairing the camera I sent them along with the 'repaired camera', but the film was RPX 25 shot on a cloudy day in Germany (I always shoot 400 ASA film and even push it and I shoot mainly under the strong Spanish Sun), and of course, it's near impossible that the leak appears in such a different condition.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/325511-leica-mp-light-leaks/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-4300709", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "325511-leica-mp-light-leaks", "result": false, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "so, here's an image showing one of the leaks from the last test -----> roll !!!  i developed yesterday.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 48497, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Vlad Soare", "date": "2021-08-10 13:05:00", "content": " 1 hour ago, raphael said: FWIW, I sold all my digital gear.

The M10 is a \"sure thing\". It's going to take me a while to build back my confidence in film photography.

After reading it, I don't see much of a need to order an M-A, and I realize that much of what I do needs to be done with digital. I still feel that as an artist, there is a place for film in my photography, and I already have two of the best Leica cameras to accomplish that. I see film as a way to capture \"art\", not \"reality\", and it's the other way 'round for digital. In other words, to me, there IS a place for analog in today's world, but I already have what I need. I used to have a full darkroom, with everything I needed, including trays for making 16\" x 20\" prints. Now I live in a tiny 600 square foot condo in South Beach, with barely enough room to turn around. I expect at some point I will be able to develop my own B&W film, and I already have everything I need except the chemicals, but I have no way of ever setting up a darkroom again. Regardless of what camera I use, to post an image here so you can view it, I have to do \"digital\". There's no way around it. Without converting my condo to a photo studio, a lot of my work will be the result of my skill WITH a computer chip and especially WITH a piece of software. .....or, to put it another way, I need to compromise. For now though, what I need is to start doing my photography with film, especially black&white film, and learn how to do it well. If that happens, I can add \"color\" to the process. This will all be in addition to my digital photography, not instead of. Sure, as long as you live in a digital world, 100% is never achievable, unless you build the scanner yourself and write the software for it yourself. But we're not talking about extremes. I have some prints on my walls where I think I could claim the 100%. I took the photos with a Mamiya RB67, which is completely mechanical and doesn't even have a light meter. I used an external incident/flash meter. Then I developed the films myself, using solutions that I mixed myself from raw chemicals. Then I printed them myself in the darkroom, on fiber based paper. Then I toned them in a sepia toner that I mixed myself from raw components. I guess one could argue that even in this case the 100% wasn't achieved, because I didn't mix the silver gelatin solution myself and didn't coat the film and paper base myself. And I didn't frame the photos myself; I had that done by a local frame shop. OK, how much of that 100% is really achievable is debatable, but the closer I get, the higher my satisfaction level will be. With a fully digital workload that percentage is zero. Not being able to reach 100% doesn't mean you should give up. Even 40% is better than 0%. The colour pictures I posted in the other thread, yes, they were scanned, and posted on the forum using a piece of software. That's true. But I'm still proud that I managed to develop C-41 at home, which until a month ago I used to think was impossible. So it's all a matter of perspective.

It's the never that's at issue, however. I had two M6s, one black (for B&W film) and one silver (for color film). I sold the silver one around 2006, when I thought I would never shoot film again. Now, keep in mind that I'm a nomad who moves annually between five months in the US and five in Thailand and the remaining two in Paris, which means that it's impractical for me to develop film myself. In 2016, I found an excellent little \"handcraft\" photo lab in Chiang Mai run by two young women who had studied photography at Chiang Mai University and fell in love with film photography. They introduced me to their ex-professor of photography who had opened a small photo lab in Bangkok, running a Kodak processing machine that he kept completely dust free. So, in 2016, I started shooting with my M6 film that I camera-scanned using a Leitz BEOON stand and a Focotar II lens: I had one BEOON in Thailand and another one in the States. At the end of the year, I bought an M3 from a Japanese store on eBay for $900: it was in great condition. I can't resist including a picture of it (again) with the Voigtlander 28/35 mini-finder that I had bought in the 1990s for $85, when it was still being produced. I shot film happily for about two years. Then, at the end of 2017, the ex-professor of photography in Bangkok died of sleep apnea and his lab closed down; and in 2019, when I got back to Chiang Mai in late-November, I found that the handcraft photo lab had also closed down: one of the owners had gone to work as an au pair in Stockholm earlier that year and the other closed down the lab after a doctor's lab tests and examination led a to prognosis of possible cancer and a recommendation that she stop dealing with film chemicals, as she had been hand-developing film to a such a great extent. With these two labs closed down, once again, I stopped shooting film. It's unlikely that I'll shoot film again, but can't get myself to sell the M3 and the M6, nor the two BEOONs because, who knows? \u2014 I may want to start shooting film again... --img-- ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317320-keep-or-sell-film-leicas/?tab=comments#comment-4125315", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "317320-keep-or-sell-film-leicas", "result": false, "Selector": "me to develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "now, keep in mind that i'm a nomad who moves annually between five months in the us and five in thailand and the remaining two in paris, which means that it's impractical for me to develop -----> film !!!  myself.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 2869, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "newtoleica", "date": "2021-01-25 20:17:00", "content": "I don't understand this at all.

Did you get overlapping frames? Irregular spacing? How do you know there's even anything wrong? The rewind knob doesn't always rotate with every single frame, the film can unwind a bit inside the canister while it's sitting, so it takes a couple frames to make the rewind knob start rotating again. If you shoot in succession, yes it will start rotating consistently, but if you let it sit at a frame it might not rotate much or at all in the next one. Especially if you're moving around and the camera gets bumped a bit. Well, the roll is still in the camera so I guess I don't know for sure that something has gone wrong. I'm just going on my prior experience that every time I advance the film the rewind knob does turn. This is the first time in four years that I have ever noticed this not happening, and it seemed awfully coincidental that it started happening immediately after I failed to fully advanced the film - also the first time I've ever done that in four years.

And I can do that with pretty much any camera. Does the M10 Monochrome OVF show images in color or b&w? The answer is no. If you refer to the LCD then both the M10 and M10 Monochrome can show images in b&w. And that applies to the EVF and LCD\u2019s of both the Q2 and Q2M. So I don\u2019t need a Monochrome camera to \u201csee\u201d in b&w as some here would claim. As I keep saying the near exclusive benefit of the Leica Monochrome cameras is output not input. I can also visualize in b/w using any camera, I just do it better with either a monochrome based digital camera, or with a camera continually loaded with b/w film, because I\u2019m not distracted by looking for both color and b/w pics at the same time when out and about, just walking around. I didn\u2019t believe, for years, that this would be the case, as I developed discipline over 40 years using b/w film. But then I bought a Monochrom and found that years of looking for both color and b/w pics had somewhat diluted that discipline. As far as output differences, the proof for me is my own prints. When I do my job well, I can make equally fine prints (I don\u2019t print huge) with any of my digital cameras, Monochrom or color based. My camera choice is dictated by things other than print quality (focal length or need for zooms, weather sealing, etc). Your points may be valid for you (assuming you\u2019ve used a Monochrom); they don\u2019t apply to my actual experience. We\u2019re all different.

One of the reasons for such a high speed lens like the Summarex were the very slow emulsions in use in Germany at the time. As we are talking about wartime Germany, I don't think we need to explore Kodak or Ilford emulsions. I started thinking about how slow these emulsions were, and then realized I really had no idea of exactly how slow they were. I don't think Germany was using DIN speed ratings at the time. One of the older ratings was Scheiner and of course, in the States we had ASA. What was the speed rating standard at the time in Germany, and can we convert this to DIN, so that my readers can get a feel for exactly how slow the emulsions were. My guess would also be that the major supplier of film stock in Germany was Agfa, and perhaps also Perutz. What emulsions did they offer, most likely in B&W. I don't think we have to worry about the original Agfacolor process with the three color filters that some early Leitz lenses (like the 73 Hektor) were fitted with.

From the first entry level DSLR through to the desire to keep my Olympus Micro 4/3 system, to the admiration of the red dot, the eye-watering costs, the initial amazement that removing features makes it more expensive, and so on. I thought the build quality on my Fujis was good but nothing I have shot with has ever come close to the build quality of a Leica M. The experience of really being involved in making a photo and learning the craft makes it so much more enjoyable than merely pointing and clicking. I don't like getting an image wrong but I appreciate the lessons and skills I'm developing. I'd say that I have learned more about photography in the 4 months I've had my M10 than the previous decade that photography has been my hobby. I really want more Leica glass (I only have one Leica lens) and that will happen with time. I'll never exit the M family even if I cannot ever afford to upgrade my M10. I told my partner that the M10 body would be a camera for life, and for the first time ever, I still feel the same several months later. Also, a big shout out to the community on this forum. Prior to buying my M10, I thought I'd be different. I wasn't going to be a pretentious Leica snob who either uses it for jewellery but can't use the gear, or a competent Leica photographer who looks down their nose at anyone that uses a different brand. But I'm not different, I just learned that those widely-held perceptions of Leica shooters are so far from the truth. I've encountered fewer snobs on here than on Fuji, Olympus, and Sony forums where there seems to be a lot of misplaced competitiveness and possible feelings of inadequacy as they tout the superiority of their brand over all others. It's probably safe to say that this community believes Leica to be the best (and I include myself in that, although it isn't the best for everyone), but it is neither boastful nor demeaning to others. Perhaps it's because for most of us, getting to shoot Leica has been a journey and we recognise it as a privilege that not everyone gets to enjoy (or indeed would enjoy).

I just noticed comparing the two side by side, when I scanned the first image, I didn't realize my Alzo Copy Stand was allowing the camera to tilt out of alignment, now I can see how much! --img--  --img--  Edited September 1 by madNbad", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/322979-scanning-film/page/7/?tab=comments#comment-4267513", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "322979-scanning-film", "result": false, "Selector": "i can develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "in an afternoon, i can develop a -----> roll !!!  of film, scan it and post process and post it.", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 97699, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Peter_S", "date": "2021-09-27 16:20:00", "content": "Am 15.9.2021 um 20:08 schrieb tardegard: Woah.

This is true. And a reason I was left scratching my head for a couple days when I first encountered the issue. I suspected heat (warm mediterranean summer), then I suspected my dev times and temps were off. But lastly I remembered that along with that film, that i had travelled with, I also developed some old 3+years expired film that had stayed half-finished in a broken camera in such weather much longer than the fresh film I travelled with, yet didn't exhibit those effects. Only then it occurred to me to check if something's up with the new scanners at airports, and unfortunately lots of people had the same exact issue and is now well understood and widespread.

My question is, how does over agitating during developing affect the finished film. All responses appreciated. I think you answered your own question, if it worked before and doesn't work now and only one thing changed, that's the thing you are looking for. Yes, vigorously sloshing fresh developer over the film does increase contrast. This is why you only agitate once every minute, to allow the shadows to catch up and to make the highlight development slow down. The highlight areas exhaust the developer first, so allowing the exhausted developer to sit undisturbed in those areas it acts as a buffer, which means vigorous or extended agitation cancels this buffering effect and over-develops the highlights. You can use increased agitation and fresh developer if you want high contrast negatives, or alternatively if you want maximum tonal information you can go the other way and use semi-stand or stand development to maximise the buffering effect of exhausted developer (but use a developer that's good for this technique).

The top strip of negatives are just about ok, the bottom strip is underdeveloped.
