From all that I have read and heard, the S3 will be the S007 with a new, higher resolution, higher DR, better colour sensor. Improved AF to me would mean multiple AF points, which I do not expect. I don't care if the present single AF point system focuses 10% faster, or even 25% faster (and that assuming it does not shred the \"permanent solution\" AF gears in the lenses). The reason I don't care is that I will not be able to use the camera in a different way. I will still have to focus and recompose, and for that way of working, the S007 is good enough as it is (ok, my S100 hunts and could be improved). Having multiple focus points would mean \"improved AF\" to me, but even then, like in pretty much all DSLRs, they would not cover enough of the viewfinder area to be hugely useful. In the sense, for example, that if I wish to place a person's eye, in a portrait shoot, in a \"rules of thirds\" position, I need to have a focusing point in that area.
