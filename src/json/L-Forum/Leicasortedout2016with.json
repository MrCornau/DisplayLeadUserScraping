And here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with, as clearly as I can. What I\u2019m writing here is specific to the M240, but certainly applicable to other cameras. Much here was gleaned from the great RED article as linked to on the first page, and the \u201cISOless M240\u201d blog entry. Information and ObservationsThe M240 CMOS sensor has a base ISO - and fixed sensitivity - of 200.The M240 CMOS sensor has a latitude of (something like) thirteen stops [a number I\u2019ve floated which has not yet been corrected; someone out there knows the real number].Manually changing the ISO number does not affect the sensitivity of the sensor.Manually changing the ISO number changes the way the software handles the light meter.Manually changing the ISO number changes the way the software manages the data the sensor receives, sometimes in negative ways.The light meter indicates (something like) a five stop range.The histogram indicates that the camera has (something like) a seven stop range.Conclusions The M240 (and not, obviously, exclusively), through the transition to digital, limits us to an apparent seven stops of latitude, while the sensor is capable of registering thirteen stops. Running the camera at ISO 200, and relying on the meter and histogram as programmed, effectively forces the photographer to rely only on the upper seven stop's sensitivity of the sensor; as the ISO is nudged up, the seven stops are effectively forced further down the sensitivity of the sensor. ISO is vestigial thinking from the days of film, a static imposition of false limits; Sensor Latitude, although fixed, allows the photographer full access to the potential of the sensor.Current camera and metering software compromises image quality because of adherence to tradition: the perpetuation of the idea that a sensor\u2019s sensitivity can be changed, as film could (roll by roll).A new way of thinking about light and sensitivity, and a meter that reflects the technical changes in exposure-reading and picture-taking, are required.Utilizing the base ISO, and using the meter only to ensure that all desired data falls within the thirteen-stop range of the sensor, with proper exposure managed in post-production, is, technically, a superior method of exposure.ProposalI propose a light meter (fixed at base ISO) that examines a scene in its entirety (per lens in use), displays a graphic indication of the range of light - the number of stops - present in the image, and what combinations of aperture & shutter speed will allow the appropriate quantity of light to reach the sensor, so that data is registered across the range of the sensor. This light meter would indicate clearly where a scene\u2019s range of light exceeds the capacity of the sensor (fifteen stops range in a scene, against a sensor that only manages thirteen stops). Cameras would chimp a full-sensor-range image, along with full-sensor-range histogram. All curves/tonality would be managed in post-processing.I would also suggest that Lux be adopted as the new standard by which we, as photographers, think about light: to learn to think and see in Lux, which can then be converted into exposure. That committed digital photographers unlearn ISO.I suggest that camera manufacturers eliminate ISO as a tool for exposure, and integrate Sensor Latitude into the software and processing of images.

I also accept your general logic. But it is incomplete and thus ineffectual. B is only not true if A is not true. But just b/c I haven't taken the time and effort to establish that A is true doesn't logically follow that A is NOT true. And so if it hasn't been established that A s not true, it cannot be definitively established that B is not true. So the only real way to definitively prove that B is not true is to definitively establish as a fact that A is not true, which neither you nor anyone else has done. Given the fact that professional film stocks are up to double the price of consumer stocks, to say that they are not \"better\" in any way is going against capitalist market efficiency principles (it is also, btw, going against what the film companies say in their data sheets). This is not to say that it is an absolute fact that price=quality; but I do think that it gives rise to a presumption that needs to be rebutted..... Taking your points in reverse order: If price is automatically a sign of quality, then we can obviously just cancel next month's Kentucky Derby. We need only find out which horse commanded the highest price at auction (capitalist market principles) and award it the necklace of roses. It must be the best, correct? It's not a smart way to judge the world - if you want to know which film is best, or which horse is fastest, you don't compare prices, you run a race. Then you know, and don't have to \"venture to guess.\" On the question of proof - I take it you would be comfortable flying on a plane, if the aviation engineer who designed it told you, \"Well, we haven't tested it, but no one has proved it is unsafe, therefore we can assume it is NOT unsafe.\" A basic principle of knowledge is, if you make a claim, it's up to you to prove your claim is correct. Unlike humans in a court of law, \"theories\" are suspect until proven innocent. By the theory-holder. In fact, when a competent scientist comes up with a theory, the first thing they do is try to prove it wrong, by poking holes in it from every angle. If they can't find any flaws, after vigorous examination and checking of assumptions and fallacies - then they publish it and let everyone else have a chance to disprove it. I guess it's just the journalist in me. \"If your mother tells you she loves you - check it out with a second source.\" I didn't \"retract\" anything.
