The summicron primes are very tempting but the current SL2 geotagging situation is keeping me from getting an SL2. I\u2019ve been using the M10 w/ visoflex for GPS and it works well enough. It can take some time to get a GPS solution but if I\u2019m outside, it\u2019ll work after some time. I get that the iPhone GNSS receiver is great and it would be nice to leverage all that tech from your phone, especially as it allows you to get a decent position indoors using WiFi positioning but this BLE situation is a letdown. I seriously hope Leica sorts out the Geotagging feature as I can\u2019t imagine shooting with an SL2 and not having geotagging - at least not while I have an M10 with Visoflex. In some ways, I feel it was a bit foolish for Leica to be binding several of their current generation products to the whims of a company like Apple in that a feature like geotagging is completely dependent on Apple\u2019s willingness to open up specific APIs for location output. If for some reason Apple decides on a whim to disable a critical API, the SL2, Q2 and any other camera that depend on the FOTOs app for geotagging would lose such a capability. For a company that prides itself on making timeless products that withstand the test of time, this not in character of Leica. Having worked in both the BLE space for consumer electronics and also in GNSS and navigation, neither paths are easy but I wish Leica would choose to own its destiny rather than let Apple decide its fate for such key features. I get part of the reason that Leica didn\u2019t want to have the GNSS receiver on the body was because the antenna bump wasn\u2019t very appealing but there are many other ways to integrate a GNSS antenna. What they need are smarter antenna designers. For example, the Apple Watch has near transparent metallic film under the display glass that act as the GNSS antenna. Garmin watches uses the outer bezel as an RF element to the GNSS antenna. Leica with some R&D money could have done something novel like putting a GNSS antenna in the glass of the top OLED display or around the hot shoe. I really wish the SL3 will bring back integrated geotagging or preferably have something integrated but also leverage the FOTOS app for indoor positioning.
