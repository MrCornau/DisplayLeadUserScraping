I have no evidence for that, but I tend to claim that digital cameras will be more prone to fail and break than any analog camera one day.

I love the thumb rest, but if I didn't try it, I wouldn't miss it. I see my M10D depreciating at around $100USD a month give or take. That's maybe 4 rolls of film + processing and scanning (depends if you do it yourself i guess). If you'll use it a lot, you'll get your money's worth. If you have other gear and shoot 1 roll of film a month, then it's probably not worthwhile (I aim to use this camera and my M10M evenly, so say 2 rolls of film a month...the price I pay short of shooting 2 extra rolls of film is $50USD, which i try to convince myself is just the convenience of shooting the M10D over a film camera. Or you could give up some other indulgence to own the camera which amounts to $50USD...or tell yourself you'll give it up).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/316665-md-262-50-summilux-or-an-m10-d/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4117318", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "316665-md-262-50-summilux-or-an-m10-d", "result": false, "Selector": "do it yourself", "selectorShort": "yourself", "MarkedSent": "that's maybe 4 -----> rolls !!!  of film + processing and scanning (depends if you do it yourself i guess).", "sortedWord": "roll", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 15213, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "seneschal", "date": "2021-07-10 20:43:00", "content": "In the end it's a question of how much damage can I do... if it needed new blinds I would have to send it to a pro shop anyway and I would have to carry that cost. If it can be repaired and it appears to be easy from doing the research, then it's the process of balancing the risk of doing damage and the cost of the potential repair versus the dopamine hit of learning new skills and about learning how the camera works, coupled with the time in a repair shop versus the immediacy of doing it yourself. There are some things I would not touch, at least not without some practice... I'm not going to dismantle and service a coupled rangefinder on a Leica or attempt DIY open heart surgery! It's not for everyone, but for those who might dare but are concerned about the risk of doing this job, I hope that I have given them the thumbs up that it can be done quite easily if you have the right tools... take advantage of me being stupid enough to take a risk and having come out the other side of it safely. By the way, it doesn't always turn out like this. I have planted a surfboard into a sandbar, smashed it and nearly drowned, by \"bravely\" going for the wrong wave and realising too late that I had made a mistake. I've had more than a few close scrapes like this when climbing or snowboarding or riding a bike... never learned my lesson.
