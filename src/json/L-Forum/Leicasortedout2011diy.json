The camera has to be disassembled completely to get at the unit. If it was sticking out in the first place it was loose before you bumped it, which may explain the crack. Just send it to Leica and decide, after you get the estimate, whether you want a repair or an upgrade. The upside is that you get a one-year guaranty on the whole camera afterwards.
