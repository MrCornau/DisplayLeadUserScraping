If I couldn't answer it, I made sure someone in my company answered it. It is part of what small companies can and should do to show their customers they care. I get so tired of the excuse for Leica that they can't do this or that because they are a small company. With 1,000 plus employees, they aren't that small. Sure compared to Sony or Nikon they are small, but they are plenty large enough to accomplish more. In fact, most small companies have the advantage of far less bureaucracy to deal with, quicker decision making ability, more innovative and nimble and thus faster to market with new and innovative products. Unless you have worked in both a small company and a large one, you can't appreciate the difference in having multiple layers of nay sayers all wanting to reduce risk and act as gate keepers. Smart managers in small companies know this and use it to their advantage in the battles against the bigger guys. Leica still operates like the world isn't changing and they really don't need to innovate and offer more and be quicker to respond. If the X Vario had been as bad as the M(240) with all of its problems, many that still haven't been fixed, I would have sent it back in the first 30 days. It is a great little camera with some serious issues that need to be fixed. I suspect that it is such a market failure, thanks to Leica's bungled marketing, that Leica may abandon it and the other X cameras. The clamor on this forum for an X with a fixed 50mm is an example of what leads Leica astray. Build an X with 50mm so they can sell all of 10? Had Leica made the X Vario a FF with an interchangeable lens, using the Olympus EV-4, EVF, and even with a slow zoom kept as close to the size of the current one, they would have had a market winner and the X series would still be in the game. How will the current X2 compete with the Sony A7 for $1,698 versus $2,000. Not very well would be my guess. The pictures I have seen on the web (from JPGs) are stunning. Skin tones look fantastic and they have a lot of pop. When people like Michael R at Luminous Landscape that are old Leica customers start leaving your brand it is time to start looking at what you are doing wrong. Unfortunately, I think the XV will drop in value considerably and I suspect M sales will also decline, so what will Leica sell other than lenses? We can all guess that Leica didn't make the XV they should have because the M department feared it would cannibalize the sales of Ms. I once worked for a company like that called Control Data Corporation. We purposely built inferior mini-computer for fear that if we built ones that were really good it would impact the sales of the super computers we built.

Be carefull when using older flashtypes (portable or studio) that work with higher ignition voltages when connecting them to moderrn digital cameras such as the Leica M-9. Using wireless connections such as a flash slave, IR or Radiowaves is an elegant precaution to avoid miseries. A limit of 5 to 6 six volts has been agreed upon by most manufacturers. Where tensions could go up to as much 90 volt DC. For some digital cameras a tension of 25 VDC is an absolute limit that could otherwise kill your camera. I have a good experience with the (more modern) Elinchrom D-lite sets 200 & 500 etc. They come with an internal flash slave and compatible RF receiver (4 coded channels) etc. Plus a separate (tiny) El -Skyport Eco Transmitter that comes with a small battery reloader. And a separate El- Skyport Elinchrom compatible RF receiver (4 identical coded channels).

Here is a comment I made in one of those many threads (the search box will bring up others, or you can just browse the sub-forum). Just as in the darkroom, the printer (or enlarger) is but part of a larger workflow necessary for fine prints. But getting a good one is an important part of the chain. A lot depends on your preferred print size. Epson is the most popular current brand, with the R3000 (13\") and 3880 (17\") among those preferred by many users here. Canon also makes some good products. I was frankly skeptical about switching from silver to digital prints, but the quality of hardware, software and print materials (papers, inks, etc) these days allows for some great results.

I am new to rangefinders and Leica having recently bought the M7 and 50mm/f2, a medium I first started using 30 years ago. I have fallen for Leica, hook line and sinker, so much so that I put my name on the waiting list for the M. But I cannot get my head round the idea of spending \u00a35000 for a camera where the lenses, to me, are the main reason to buy into the system. I am an enthusiast who takes photographs of landscapes and when travelling; I prefer B&W, which the M7 will fulfill. I have been on the waiting list for 3 months now, but I cannot stop trying to talk myself out of this. I bought the M7 in order to slow my photography down and take more time composing each shot. I found that using a DSLR became an extension of a point and shoot where you could take image after image and manipulate them as you would wish in post production. I am considering the following options: 1. Remove my name from the M list and remain faithful to my Canon 5Dii and newly acquired M7 for B&W. a. Get the 35mm ASPH f1.4 (#11663) with the money saved. I have recently found that the 50mm does not provide a sufficient angle of view for all my needs. However, would the 35mm f2 (#11879) be as good for street and landscape photography? I can always push process my film should I need a higher ISO. Several threads suggest flare and CA as issues on the Summilux. Please do not bring the ASPHERICAL and any earlier versions into the discussion (I am still waiting for member IWC Doppel to complete his comparison test with the 35mm ASPH FLE version from another thread !) 2. Continue with my purchase of the M. 3. Wait for the next reincarnation of the M, but when will this be - 2015 ?? 4. Get a Fuji X100s/ X Pro 1 for colour to compliment my M7.

Leica is its primary theme.Subjects include Leica products, Leica photos, the Leica Camera company. It\u2019s for everyone with an interest in Leica.Anyone who is interested in Leica can inform themselves here and interact with others.This is a meeting place for people from all over the world who enjoy and take an interest in Leica. Purely factual information is important but so is passion and contact with other enthusiasts. A balance has to be struck so that everyone can feel at ease.Everyone is welcome, as long as they show respect for other members, their opinions and the forum rules.Mutual respect is the most important requirement, so that people from different backgrounds, religion and ideology can interact.The rules of the forum exist to facilitate interaction by laying down how we should behave towards each other as well as the technical and legal rules. If you don\u2019t respect the rules of the game, you can\u2019t play.Criticism is explicitly welcomed, as long as it remains objective and does not become an end in itself.There is probably nowhere on the planet where so much and such harsh criticism of Leica is expressed. There is nothing wrong with that.There are, however, limits. Unsubstantiated or defamatory criticism has no place here any more than do the same points repeated over and over again like a mantra.The same goes when it comes to criticising photos. It takes a certain courage to put forward one\u2019s pictures for open discussion.If you don\u2019t like a photo, there\u2019s nothing wrong with offering constructive criticism. What we won\u2019t put up with are derogatory, insulting and disparaging comments.When you post your contribution, please bear in mind that the person you are addressing doesn\u2019t know you or your tone of voice, your gestures or the expression on your face, and may not share your sense of humour. Misunderstandings cannot be 100% avoided but we must all try not to offend the other person. Saying \u201cno offence meant\u201d or that it was just a joke doesn\u2019t help if the other person has taken it the wrong way.What the forum is not forThis isn\u2019t the place for those who think that Leica, Leica products and Leica customers are inadequate, deceitful or stupid.Some members, apparently, use the forum exclusively to express the same criticisms again and again, spoiling for others the enjoyment of their hobby.This isn\u2019t a forum for sycophants and fanboys but neither is it a Leica-bashing community. No-one in the Leica forum should ever have to justify their purchase of a Leica product or their enjoyment of it.This isn\u2019t the place for proselytisingNo matter whether it\u2019s political, religious or ideological, or concerns a specific brand (though with Leica we are more tolerant), anyone who seeks to impose their \u201ctruth\u201d on others, should please do so elsewhere. They are excluded so that our forum can operate as a mixture of different people with a variety of religious, ideological and political convictions.No more political, ideological or religious discussionCaf\u00e9 Leitz and Barnack's Bar were set up at the end of 2011 as a place for off-topic discussions. Lately it has become, unfortunately, a place for regulars to air subjects which have nothing to do with Leica or photography (OK, off-topic) but do have maximum potential for stirring up trouble. And that is not OK.The conflicts and animosities in Caf\u00e9 Leitz / Barnack's Bar are spreading to other parts of the forum. That is why, with immediate effect, we are going to close and remove discussions of that kind in Caf\u00e9 Leitz / Barnack's Bar and elsewhere. Our decision will appear subjective but it is based on our experience as a moderator and on what is best for the forum.Unpleasant facts (not really)In conclusion, some information about my role as administrator of the forum.This forum is a commercial undertaking.With 15,000 visitors daily, this forum cannot be managed as a hobby. After a long period of muddling through I have made this forum my main job and I make my living from it.It takes a lot of work and it costs money, so I don\u2019t feel guilty about making money from it.The good news is that I enjoy doing it and, as the Leica forum now generates a large proportion of my income, I have a fundamental interest in keeping the shop going. You can rely, therefore, on its continuing.This forum is not a democracy.That sounds bad but it needs saying once in a while. As administrator I bear, more or less on my own, the technical, legal and financial responsibility for the forum. I am happy to accept that but I can only do so if I am free to make decisions.Now for the good news. I value my customers and will do my best to help you feel good about being here. To that end I will always consult you but, ultimately, I alone will make the decisions, to ensure that due regard is had to every aspect of the matter (e.g. technical, legal and financial).Andreas J\u00fcrgensenAdmin & OwnerTranslation by euston (Thanks!)

A lot of hotels won't have worked out their discounted rates for that far ahead yet, and you will only find the full price room rates listed on online sites until nearer the time. I have stayed at a number of hotels in Istanbul over the years, and have never had a bad experience. But it does depend on how much you wish to spend. At the top of the scale places like intercontinental are really excellent, but pricey. Middle range Marmara, Grand Hyatt, and Swisshotel Bosphorous are all good. There are plenty at the budget end as well - most recently I stayed at Ramada Taksim which iirc was less than 100\u20ac per night, and it was a good hotel, well located.

But just a question: while I think it's great having a pint, having a discussion or looking at each other's cameras, lenses and pictures, I've never understood why people like to meet and shoot. I've always considered photographing to be a solitary activity and would never think going shooting even with one other person, much less with two or more. Am I missing something? \u2014Mitch/Bangkok Well that's a fair question Mitch, let me try and give you an answer. When I travel I realize that locals have a distinct advantage over me in knowing how to find the interesting sections, neighborhoods and people of a particular town. For instance when I visited Bangkok last year, I met up with members Edward Karaa, Teera Ashakul and Rammy Narula, and we all then attended Richard Bram and David Gibson's \"iN PUBLiC\" exhibition. We also had the opportunity to compare notes, walk around some neighborhoods which I probably would have never found on my own, and \"talk shop\". The four of us had varying degrees of experience, from Edward who has worked as a photojournalist to Teera, who had just bought his first Leica. We all, I believe, benefitted from the exchange. Later Teera visited Hong Kong, and I was able to show him around a bit, as well as answer more Leica questions. I am also a solitary photographer, and when I meet up I tend to view the experience more as a recce than as a mission. If something looks interesting I make a note and come back later. For me it is much more enjoyable to see how other photographers work, from pro to rank amateur, and amazingly I find that I almost always learn something new. This past January I met up with a friend in Cambodia and his father, who had just bought his first ever non P&S camera, a Canon 6D. This man was a sponge for information, and had never taken any photos in his life that were not family or travel snaps. I briefed him on the basics and off we went to shoot. After an hour I realized that he was so latched on to me that whatever I was shooting he was shooting. I soon started taking photos of trash cans, phone polls, license plates...anything boring I could find, and sure enough he followed me. I then explained that photography is about finding one's inner vision, and that he couldn't do that just by parroting me. I love Hong Kong, and I'm there every couple of months. There are around a half dozen of us who like to get together, have a coffee at agnis b., talk shop and sometimes shoot in Yau Ma Tei, Wan Chai or other locals. We also like to get together and print, something which I never tire of. I realize this may sound absolutely dreadful to you, but I tend to enjoy meeting new people, visiting new places and experiencing new things. It's just the way I am. When my wife and I travel there is one question which she dreads more than any other....\"Hey, is that a Leica?\" She knows from experience that this question is never answered with a simple \"Yes\". Cheers, and hope our paths cross one day.

Even though it is all speculative, it makes frightening reading (to me at least). However, the contributors have missed out some key issues. Granted, Sony builds for the mass market and has every intention of regularly replacing perfectly good models with different ones incorporating their own systems to achieve their own objectives. In other words their designs are proprietary, so why would they open the door (with the M mount) to existing manufacturers to muscle in on a proprietary market that they can control. But the issue yet to be mentioned is that the mass consumer market drools over specifications and claims of fast super fast autofocus, object tracking and selectable areas of focus and Image Stabilisation. These features are impossible with the Leica M system. Not important to Leica users but definitely \"THE\" selling point to many photographers including Pro's I do have both the NEX7 and the M9. I purchased the M9 immediately on returning from a disastrous trip with the NEX7 and Zeiss lenses. The NEX is fiddly, too small, too light, has no custom settings, and is too susceptible to shooting with unintended settings. It fell apart and had to be rebuilt by Sony. The LCD screen degraded with moisture from my hand. The files have to be preprocessed up to DNG and often Cornerfixed. That's not going to suit your average amateur. I haven't used it since it was returned from Sony despite having an adaptor for my Leica lenses. Every process degrades the image in some way and I was very conscious of an unwanted pattern lurking in the depths of each image finally brought into Lightroom Considering all the technical wants and dreams expressed in this discussion thread, I suggest participants \"be careful what you wish for because you might get it!\". I most certainly don't want a Nex in Leica clothing. All those menus and configurable buttons? - no thanks!. In fact, I'm happy with my M9-P and I expect to be happy with my next purchase of either an MM or M240. Whatever Leica give me, I'll work with. I no longer want or use my perfectly refurbished NEX7 which I would describe as having no character or presence. If and when I discover that I need a camera body with a mind to replace my own, I'll hire someone to shoot me!
