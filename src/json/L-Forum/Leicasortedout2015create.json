Each has its place and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, for sure, but I cannot recreate the \"look\" I have come to prefer from the source files of the M240. I find this most pronounced in pictures of people which is my most frequent and preferred subject matter. Others might not agree and might prefer the files they are getting or might think a compromise was needed to gain other advantages they needed or wanted.. Perhaps someone has a \u201csecret sauce\u201d in post processing that has not yet been shared and demonstrated\u2026.which may in fact be proprietary. Okay\u2026.but it has eluded me and has eluded others and not for want of trying. While I do not \u201clike\u201d change as much as I wish I did, this has never stopped me from pursuing and embracing it. I think the M240 has great versatility and wonderful features as a camera but something changed not for the better for me in terms of the images I can create with it. I hoped that the letter would continue a positive, informed discussion not only among photographers/customers but also with representatives from Leica, too. I would never discourage someone's success or satisfaction with the tools, features, and, ultimately, images they prefer. In fact, I like to celebrate that. Peter, personally, deserves more credibility and respect for his findings than some of the responses that have been posted here exhibit. His work is astonishingly good and he has devoted a great deal of time and open-minded experimentation to this effort. I agree with the letter (that's why I signed it) and share an interest in further developing the CCD sensor technology\u2026or frankly, any technology, that creates files I can turn into the kinds of images I have come to treasure from the M9 (and the M8) with their CCD sensors. For those of you for whom the CMOS sensor is giving you preferred imagery? Wonderful. Does this mean that it is giving everyone preferred imagery? No. Does it mean that one can seamlessly \"convert\" a CMOS file into one that emerged from a CCD sensor? No, it doesn't. At least in many images where the differences matter most. Hence the letter.
