I tested some solutions, how to integrate your tool in my workflow on a Mac, mainly centred around Adobe Lightroom and would currently have one major wish and a few suggestions regarding smoothing the workflow: 1) Is it possible to modify the droplet file via Apple script, so the resulting DNG files, created by m8raw2dng will be written into the same folder, the original RAW+JPG pairs are residing in? I want to keep the RAW+JPG pairs together in the same folder as the DNGs, I work with in Lightroom. This would allow for future work on them. Of course! Just don't pass the -o parameter. That way the output is not specified and the input folder will be taken as output. Be aware that the M8 DNGs will be modified, too... So make a secure copy while this is in Beta! --img--  2) Is there any possibility for a future m8raw2dng revision, which does not need the accompanying JPG file? I would love to discard the JPG, as I always do when cameras write raw + JPG files. I have absolutely no use for them, except m8raw2dng needs them currently, as I understand. Well that is at the moment not possible. The reason is that the RAW files do not contain exif information. You would be left without Exposure Time, Aperture Value, ISO... But technically it is not a problem. Could you describe your need to discard the JPG further? So when do you delete them, what do you want to keep and why? I think I could come up with a satisfying solution... Why do you want to keep the RAW files but not the JPG after conversion? For future releases? I could modify the RAW files and add exif information for backup purposes maybe. Or strip the jpg of image data and just keep the few bytes of information. Would that be what you want? 3) I suggest, that after a successful batch conversion of several files a small \"result\" is displayed in terminal in the jest of \"83 of 83 files were successfully converted\". This would provide a quick, assuring information after a longer batch conversion for people, who come back to their computer after having a coffee, \u2026 Currently each file conversion is documented within Terminal, so one could seek this assurance by scrolling trough each dialog. Now a big bonus would be if it would be possible, if m8raw2dng would support to post this final result into the OS X notification center and remain there with a time stamp and the result message until manually deleted instead of keeping the Terminal window alive after completed conversion. The first part I have thought of myself already. If I'm converting hundreds of pictures at a time the error messages just disappear... --img--  I thought of writing a log file of the latest conversion with the error messages and to do exactly such a warning line at the end of conversion. Will be done in the first revision of the beta. About the OS X notification center I'll have to see... Am not familiar with it. Not sure if I can and will do that. I know, this is getting ahead of things and a big wish, but maybe it is possible ;-) ? Your new revision is a great thing - it made me break out my trusty old M8.2 again and use it mainly to find, what it can give me as a second body. I always loved the crisp, detailed files from the M8 sensor over the M9 sensor so I am keeping my M8.2 as of your software! That's nice to hear! Enjoy it and as always, there is more to come!

With the exception of the stuff that needs a bit of organising (like a train trip between Tokyo and Kyoto) we are flexible on the other plans, and also open to suggestions: Our intention is to run the \u2018Challenge\u2019 on May 23rd 2015 in Kyoto (location to be decided, but possibly starting near the train station). As such a trip would be more than just a weekend trip for most people, our thought was to organise some informal events in the preceding week as well. We thought that it would be practical to fly into Tokyo and out of Kyoto (or other airport - as most airlines will allow you to purchase \"open jaw\" tickets at a comparible price with a different arrival and departure airport). This plan allows us to acclimatise to Japan in Tokyo, take in some sights/experiences there and then move onto Kyoto later in the week. Kyoto has been suggested by a number of interested members as a prefered challenge location. Here's roughly what we are considering: Sunday 17th May: Yoyogi Park & Harajuku Monday 18th May: Tokyo Temples Tuesday 19th May: Shinjuku/Ginza camera shopping --img--  Visit to Leica Gallery Wednesday 20th May: Fish market (morning) Thursday 21st May: Train to Kyoto (a 2.5 hour journey, depending on the train chosen) Friday 22nd May: Kyoto Temples (oh, and maybe this too Leica Store Kyoto on Vimeo) Saturday 23rd May: First Leica Asia Challenge (afternoon) I will most likely arrive in Japan earlier than the 17th to visit relatives and Dan is planning to either arrive earlier or depart later.

The Tasting Room is ideal as a meeting point / lunch venue and situated directly opposite Ace Cameras. I suggest we meet at The Tasting Room at 11:30 am on Saturday 19th April 2014. The address is 6 Green Street, Bath, BA1 2JY and their website is TASTING ROOM - wine / caf\u00e9 / bar / brasserie serving modern Mediterranean style dishes. They will be more than happy to accomodate us and reserve a table for us. As we shall be there on a Saturday, they would like to have a good idea of numbers. Please could you let me know as soon as possible if you intend to join us. I shall book the table one month before the meet so let me know by the 18th March please! Ace Cameras would also like to welcome us to their establishment and, also dependant on numbers, said they would contact Leica and see if they too would be interested in laying something on for us. I reckon we should make the most of their hospitality --img--  I asked if they could lay on an S for each of us. Did they laugh or what --img--  The location of these is ideally situated for moving on to the central sites in Bath. Pultney Bridge, The Abbey, The Roman Baths, Queen Square, Bath Rugby Ground, The Circle and the main shops are all within easy walking distance. Bath Spa railway Station is, according to Google Maps, 0.6 miles from Ace Cameras and a very straightforward route. I think we might park in Waitrose's car park, which is just round the corner from Ace Cameras. There is also a much larger car park in Charlotte Street, approx 1/2 mile walk to the dealer. All being well, this chap typifies the sort of welcome we can expect on the day. His only worry was that I might be from the Social, checking up on him --img--  --img--  Ok then, that is the plan and Lynn and I look forward to meeting up with all of you on the day for what promises to be a fun day out!!
