This is time, instead of using my Sumilux 35 ASPH pre FLE, I decided to go with the Nokton 35 1.4 MC vII. I chose this lens because it has a more vintage classic look, IMO, and I wanted to see if we could lose that character with a very modern camera like the Sony if it would render as nicely. All photos where shot in raw, about 20 secs apart from each other. They are not always exactly the same cause I did it handheld. I wish I had more people, and in general more interesting stuff but France just got under lock down again so I had to do it all at home. My kids and my dog move too fast for lens change, and my wife has stopped accepting to be the subject of these camera tests long ago. The photos are all very very boring, but the point of this test was just to compare the cameras in different scenarios. A note on shooting with both camera: On the M10P , it was actually easier to focus with the RF than with the Focus peaking on the Sony, even if the Sony is nice. The metering on the A7SIII outperforms the M10P almost every time, even though I used the M10P in live mode to avoid spot metering. I did the blind test to myself, and to be honest I could not always guess which camera was which. But almost every time I shocked myself and preferred the Sony to the Leica. Of course, shooting wise, the Sony was still disgusting, and the Leica was a total pleasure. But what I remember from this is that 12MP vs 24MP produces no aesthetics difference (since this is what this thread is about). Besides that, of course I prefer my Leica, but if one day I go out to shoot video with my Sony, I know that I could bring my 35 mil with me and still get photos as well. Let me know if you have any interrogation on the way I took the photos, settings, etc.... Now my question to you is not which camera is Sony and which is Leica, but which one did you prefer ? https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31?usp=sharing Your pictures have produced some advanced thoughts. The setting is world class beautiful. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WClYBcwQb_i2Nw6DHF8-4vHfUtxCPF31 TECHNICAL COMMENT ON THE TEST: For each two pictures, one picture is usually more sharp than the other. Can not say which I like best. The sharper picture had more of a \"still life\" feel to it. The less sharp more of an atmospheric feel. Which I liked more depended on subject matter. I can not say that I saw the M10 24 meg smoothness verses the M10-R 40 meg light harshness though yet another version of this effect is illustrated in your pictures. Overall I liked the sharper one better because it catches that \"still life\" aesthetic. Yet the sharpness was somewhat of a smooth-sharpness, not with a irritating harsh edge, maybe due to lens choice. Increasingly I see this as important, that if the sensor has the highest level of megabytes, it will be \"sharp\" but it might also produce a pixelation type digital-harsh-edge harshness that is not exactly seen but felt, since that edge harshness is only slightly there out at the highest levels of resolution. The paragraph immediately above is the only explanation I can give for the M10's pictures being more satisfying (somehow less harsh) than the M10-R's. Yet with software the M10-R's rendition might be smoothable to end this lightly irritating harshness and thus create the best still life's (see below Art Comment). So overall I would say that if a person is good with post production software the M10-R might be the better choice. Yet I dislike spending hours in post and prefer the adjustment be selectable in the camera. HIGHER MEG SENSOR HARSHNESS: In the interest of the intellectual study of the arts I will venture an explanation which might be torn down latter. Some will say this 40 meg harshness is just a matter of contrast technically but I would go further and say that it might be the sharp 40 line pairs (80 lines) MTF test-lines of the lens interacting with the inherent digital pixelation harshness of small pixel (40 meg based) digital sensor capture. Thus the 24 meg digital with big pixels and less resolution can not produce this harshness at the higher resolution 80 line mtf test point but the 40 meg can see this fine edge making it rough/harsh where the 24meg sensor misses this fine detail. If the camera software does not soften up this new increased detail a bit then you get a sort of micro edge harshness that 24 meg could not produce. Through your choice (not a mistake) of a less sharp and artistically rendering lens (Voitlander Nokton 35mm1.4), the lens helps make the picture work, softening the digital harshness effect. With a sharper Leica lens directing light to a sharper Leica 40 meg sensor, a harshness might be produced which irritates as seen by we ultra sensitive viewers, and as found in the previous M10 24meg vs M10-R 40meg pictures by we ultra-sensitives (not trolls). As in Formula One racing\u2026 the most moneyed race engineers hit the limits of the physics first and see problematic phenomena that create problems to be dealt with. Less moneyed race teams working with known technology do not see these problems. Thus the M10-R 40 meg plus the sharpest of Leica lenses may be producing this harsh line edge which makes M10's softer edge line edge more desirable. Fix it in post as they say (if that is fully possible). The M10 is definitely a standout camera in the history of digital cameras in both how it treats sharpness and color saturation. ART COMMENT: One of the many explanations for the \"still life\" effect is: as the eye looks around it sees something that looks real because of an extremely high level of detail, yet your mind also knows that \"it is not real it is a picture\". This dichotomy is intriguing, to vacillate between the emotional-mental sensation of real and unreal. Again, by using smallest F-stops and high meg sensors and sharpest lenses, placing the ultra high resolution in various places around the scene where the eye would not normally see so much detail, signals the mind that something otherworldly is going on. Again, the emotion is one of \"this is real but it is not real\" which is otherworldly giving an accompanying intrigue. So in Still Life you have at least two intrigues: 1- Picture representation verses reality and 2- The beyond human focus detail verses what your eye-mind is normally encountering in the real world. In the USA some call this aesthetic \"American Realism\" as the ultra high detail of a painter's Still Life \"table top subject\" is applied to \"a scene much larger than a table top\". In the picture your eye sees more detail than it would ever see in real life. All around the frame picture elements \"pop\" into life as their detail is noticed. BACK TO CAMERAS: The ability of the 40 meg sensor to create this Still Life ultra sharpness effect, means I would favor the sharper higher meg picture if the harshness can be lessoned by some de-sharpening. Also maybe software can soften the 40 meg picture down to the more atmospheric softer focus effect of the 24 meg? Fixing in post production software to me frequently creates a picture that looks way too extreme, artificial, and childish like advertising shock techniques so I would rather the camera produce a satisfying rendition in a more eye-natural manner. I do not want to spend hours playing with software sliders that mainly result in an unrealistic looking \"mechanical\" picture. Do I have the time or interest in trying to make the two cameras match one another in post... probably not. I will leave this for people like the great Overgaard. Still can he make one camera perform like two cameras... it is too much to ask. If not or with a little changing of the picture in post... two cameras sit out there on the market with unique and justifiable existences. The artsy 24 meg soft sharpness camera M10 and the 40 meg M10-R with an edge hardness that can likely be lessoned in software to produce a fascinating Still Life ultra high resolution rendition. One website I read comments that the M10-R's 40 megs helps see the original rendition of older Leica lenses (Steve Huff's site). To me this is a holy grail for camera bodies - to bring out the old Leica lens characteristics. I find it odd that people want their lenses \"corrected\" by software. Clearly they have missed the concept of \"art\" as a \"partially real and part modified\" representation of reality. IF I MADE DECISIONS FOR THE LEICA COMPANY: I would NOT only let the time and attention of the marketplace decide the popularity of my camera and aesthetic. I would also produce download instructions for manually entered adjustments for the different aesthetics and also produce template files where possible. Why let 3rd parties decide your economic survival? Why leave the user in the dark without the knowledge to fully use the camera? Yet best would be a checkbox in the camera's menu software that would produce the 24meg softer aesthetic or the 40 meg sharper still life aesthetic.

I would also produce download instructions for manually entered adjustments for the different aesthetics and also produce template files where possible. Why let 3rd parties decide your economic survival? Why leave the user in the dark without the knowledge to fully use the camera? Yet best would be a checkbox in the camera's menu software that would produce the 24meg softer aesthetic or the 40 meg sharper still life aesthetic. Thanks for the picture test Steve... you got me thinking. Brilliant post Tom. I enjoyed reading through it very much, and a lot of your points have left me thinking. But before I can make my mind too, I must ask you something. You mention that one series of the photos I took in the test looks sharper, more still life. Could you tell me if it\u2019s series A or series B? I want to see if your feel is based on actual MP count, or if other factors could have influenced it, for example maybe better DR of the M10R/A7S3 sensors ..... in any case, some people said before they this thread was useless. Your post proved it isn\u2019t. At least not for everyone, not for me...

advanced thoughts. the setting is world class beautiful. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wclybcwqb_i2nw6dhf8-4vhfutxcpf31 technical comment on the test: for each two pictures, one picture is usually more sharp than the other. can not say which i like best. the sharper picture had more of a \"still life\" feel to it. the less sharp more of an atmospheric feel. which i liked more depended on subject matter. i can not say that i saw the m10 24 meg smoothness verses the m10-r 40 meg light harshness though yet another version of this effect is illustrated in your pictures. overall i liked the sharper one better because it catches that \"still life\" aesthetic. yet the sharpness was somewhat of a smooth-sharpness, not with a irritating harsh edge, maybe due to lens choice. increasingly i see this as important, that if the sensor has the highest level of megabytes, it will be \"sharp\" but it might also produce a pixelation type digital-harsh-edge harshness that is not exactly seen but felt, since that edge harshness is only slightly there out at the highest levels of resolution. the paragraph immediately above is the only explanation i can give for the m10's pictures being more satisfying (somehow less harsh) than the m10-r's. yet with software the m10-r's rendition might be smoothable to end this lightly irritating harshness and thus create the best still life's (see below art comment). so overall i would say that if a person is good with post production software the m10-r might be the better choice. yet i dislike spending hours in post and prefer the adjustment be selectable in the camera. higher meg sensor harshness: in the interest of the intellectual study of the arts i will venture an explanation which might be torn down latter. some will say this 40 meg harshness is just a matter of contrast technically but i would go further and say that it might be the sharp 40 line pairs (80 lines) mtf test-lines of the lens interacting with the inherent digital pixelation harshness of small pixel (40 meg based) digital sensor capture. thus the 24 meg digital with big pixels and less resolution can not produce this harshness at the higher resolution 80 line mtf test point but the 40 meg can see this fine edge making it rough/harsh where the 24meg sensor misses this fine detail. if the camera software does not soften up this new increased detail a bit then you get a sort of micro edge harshness that 24 meg could not produce. through your choice (not a mistake) of a less sharp and artistically rendering lens (voitlander nokton 35mm1.4), the lens helps make the picture work, softening the digital harshness effect. with a sharper leica lens directing light to a sharper leica 40 meg sensor, a harshness might be produced which irritates as seen by we ultra sensitive viewers, and as found in the previous m10 24meg vs m10-r 40meg pictures by we ultra-sensitives (not trolls). as in formula one racing\u2026 the most moneyed race engineers hit the limits of the physics first and see problematic phenomena that create problems to be dealt with. less moneyed race teams working with known technology do not see these problems. thus the m10-r 40 meg plus the sharpest of leica lenses may be producing this harsh line edge which makes m10's softer edge line edge more desirable. fix it in post as they say (if that is fully possible). the m10 is definitely a standout camera in the history of digital cameras in both how it treats sharpness and color saturation. art comment: one of the many explanations for the \"still life\" effect is: as the eye looks around it sees something that looks real because of an extremely high level of detail, yet your mind also knows that \"it is not real it is a picture\". this dichotomy is intriguing, to vacillate between the emotional-mental sensation of real and unreal. again, by using smallest f-stops and high meg sensors and sharpest lenses, placing the ultra high resolution in various places around the scene where the eye would not normally see so much detail, signals the mind that something otherworldly is going on. again, the emotion is one of \"this is real but it is not real\" which is otherworldly giving an accompanying intrigue. so in still life you have at least two intrigues: 1- picture representation verses reality and 2- the beyond human focus detail verses what your eye-mind is normally encountering in the real world. in the usa some call this aesthetic \"american realism\" as the ultra high detail of a painter's still life \"table top subject\" is applied to \"a scene much larger than a table top\". in the picture your eye sees more detail than it would ever see in real life. all around the frame picture elements \"pop\" into life as their detail is noticed. back to cameras: the ability of the 40 meg sensor to create this still life ultra sharpness effect, means i would favor the sharper higher meg picture if the harshness can be lessoned by some de-sharpening. also maybe software can soften the 40 meg picture down to the more atmospheric softer focus effect of the 24 meg? fixing in post production software to -----> me !!!  -----> frequently

Post processing, like everything else in photography, requires a good eye and good judgment/decision making. It\u2019s not about pushing a bunch of sliders around, any more than making a gorgeous silver print comes from waving a burning or dodging wand all over the place hoping for success. Anybody can learn techniques; the hard pard is always deciding when, where and to what degree to apply them. Changes are often subtle, on a localized level (not just global), where a very good print suddenly becomes one that \u2018sings\u2019. And even then, display lighting is critical. Nuances, small changes, not gross enhancements often make the most important differences. No different than using a camera; some people consistently aim it in subtly but noticeably better directions than others. A good eye and good decision making. Digital post processing also needn\u2019t be hard or tedious or time consuming. After 30+ years working in darkrooms, I find digital PP incredibly convenient and flexible. Creating custom presets and/or different default import settings only adds to the potential time saving. Likewise, making a custom color profile for a camera under common lighting conditions is quick and easy using a tool like the ColorChecker Passport. Similarly, I print using ImagePrint software and it operates in full time soft proof mode so what I see on screen is closer to what I get in print, and it includes custom profiles for all papers and lighting conditions. These and other tools are not cheating, and are not designed to alter a camera\u2019s natural output, but rather to refine to suit one\u2019s style and taste, just as it\u2019s always been in photography. A fine black and white silver print never came straight from the camera (even Weston\u2019s contact prints required skill and judgment), nor does most any digital print in my experience. The files from an M10 Monochrom, for instance, are typically flat and dull; who wants to see a print straight out of camera? Again, I have cameras with 18, 24, and 47 MP, and I know that you would be unable to reliably pick which of my prints (which I custom mat and frame on my own) are derived from each.

You can use a separate file as others have said below, but then you're starting from the top again. I tend to edit an image, leave it for a day then come back to it and pull back on my over-zealous editing. This is impossible in SFX due to the destructive nature (unless I am missing something?).

The only way to show grain. - and I film days one did all that one could do to avoid showing grain - is to use film and print on silver-gelatin paper. As soon as you move to a scan of your negative or paper print you go from grain to electronic noise. I have a high-res dedicated 35mm scanner which shows grain in almost the same way as my enlarger! Grain is a part of the negative itself, scanning doesn't get rid of it and it certainly does pick it up (though cheaper scanners can introduce colour and luminescence noise just like a digital camera on top of it). I actually really like subtle grain in bnw as I feel it gives your eyes something to lock on to.

(in this case i would create a virtual image so as to ensure that the old image is always available for other purposes). then just click the \"black and white\" option and the image is converted. then use the color balance sliders to the left or right to achieve a color filter effect similar to that which would have been achieved when shooting black and white film with an actual color filter on the lens. you can also change contrast structure etc. the main reason i do not use lightroom this way every time is that one of the finishing effects i like to use in nik silver efex is the toning effect (using a slight silver tone in the final image). i find a slight tinge of this color tone )almost invisible) gives a better result for many images. the following image was converted in this manner with this slight toning. a friendly face with coffee by life in shadows, on flickr great image! maybe i do need to give sfx a go and just suck it up that i can't go back and make subtle changes later. --- thank you to everyone for the replies!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 17497, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "LeicaR10", "date": "2020-08-14 22:22:00", "content": " Jplomley, I use the M10-M for my commercial landscape photography business.

In Sept. 2019 after about 10 years I have changed from the M8.2 to an M10-P and never regretted it one single day. All things M8.2 did are done much better by M10-P, as higher usable ISO, faster image storage and higher battery capacity. Not to forget those pleasant conveniences such as constant image control by display or electronic viewfinder, the spirit level or the net grille. Arvid seems to have ended his m8raw2dng project and there should be no assistence anymore. Here's his m8raw2dng-droplet.app.zipfor download again, but without a very helpful step by step explanation given from another member of the LUF I never would have got it to run. Now I'm very thankful to got rid of that annoying button dance every time I startet the M8.2 for taking photos with that factory raw program and save time as those raws don't need to be converted first to dngs before one can develop them by a picture image program. It sounds hard but it's better to spare for a much more modern digital Leica-M like an M10 than investing your hard earned money into outdated stuff like M8. Peter Karbe, chief lens designer of Leica, told from the M8 as his most hated digital Leica-M, an important and necessary step for Leica but now only history. As the owner of an M (typ 240), SL, CL digital, M 8.2 and a D-Lux, I tried the M10 and in comparison to the SL and the M (typ 240), I didn't see a big enough differential except for the Visoflex 020 v. the EVF 2. The SL, though bigger, outperforms the M10 on several bases. To start, the AF lenses make it a virtual DSLR for fast shoots, the M-Lens Adapter allows me to use my precious glass on an advanced body and the focus peaking is not overly contrasted (it's adjustable). I'm heavily invested in Leica and I have created a flexible kit with the adapters and camera choices. I recently bought a mint 35-70 R-mount and adapter for less than $500 (U.S.) for the M (tip 240) and am enjoying telephoto on an M camera for the first time. Conversely, I purchased the fixed lens D-Lux because I was being denied entry into certain concerts and venues with my replaceable lens camera bodies. I love the M 8.2 because the 10.3 mp CCD sensor is special. Its simple menu, classic look and feel, renders certain subjects excellently. Plus, with the RF calibrated properly, my pictures are sharp enough for what I need it for (up to 8 x 10). Having wrestled with new technology v. old, the only tech that counts is the photographer and what he seeks to render.

I find it interesting that some S system photographers appear to forget the history of the camera. The S system saved Leica from oblivion. Dr Kaufmann and senior management realized the company could not compete in a bloated and super competitive DSLR market with fielding the R10. Hence the R10 and R system as a whole was cancelled. The company double downed and bet on creating the S system for professional photographers...not the masses. The S2 ($23K+) when initially fielded was herald by the pros and critics as a futuristic MF camera...ahead of its time. The camera and superior S lenses continue to outperform the competition for resolution, color, aberrations etc. The S cameras are all excellent for their intended design and capability afforded at the time of fielding. The S camera, lenses and photographs that are created are truly a class of its own. I keep reading photographers keep asking for more MPs and lenses for the S. For what end? Leica understands and listens to the pros whom the S system is designed to meet their requirements. All the lenses made to date, exceed most pros requirements. Professionally, if I was to need longer focal length, I can buy a Leica adapter and put a long lens on the S be it Contax or Hasselblad. PC lens...don't need it or want it. All PC corrections I need are fixed using Photoshop or Lightroom. Does the S need more than 64 MPs. Not needed for my corporate clients and private collectors photographs that I create for them. If I needed more, I would go rent/lease a Phase One for a particular job and return it. All the S lenses and now S3 more than meets many pro photographers requirements.

I don\u2019t know if it is the romantic notion of a high speed lens from the early days of the Leica, or just the name itself. It\u2019s just cool! Anyway, I am extending an invitation to you all here to write an in depth article on the Xenon, or perhaps a series of articles for the LHSA Viewfinder. I am thinking something along the lines of development, production and variations and the patent story. I did include one of my Xenons in my Bokeh Kings article a few years ago. Well, who\u2019s up for the challenge? William, Tears Everywhere, pgk, Roydonian? Let\u2019s do it! Thanks Bill, I'm happy to throw in my few pennies/cents. I'm with Paul (pgk) in saying that this is a story which does not begin with Schneider and end with Leitz. While any magazine article must have boundaries, the story of camera lens development is a continuous one from the 1840s up to the present and, even then, the story begins way before that period. In the Royal Dublin Dublin Society (RDS), where I am a member, we have an original example of the first edition of Newton's Opticks which was published in 1704 and which was the cornerstone of a lot of subsequent optical studies. I recently had a chance to inspect it and found that someone had actually borrowed the book on a library ticket around 1960. Thankfully, the book was returned within the requisite two weeks as the most recent copy of the original edition which sold at auction fetched about $90,000. I have not contacted Jim Lager yet about this specific Xenon topic as the details were coming in very thick and fast over the weekend. I'm also looking around for a topic for a possible LHSA ZOOM meeting hosted from Dublin during the Summer while we are all in full or semi lockdown. I'm trying to find a 'vintage theme' that will engage members. 1 hour ago, Tears Everywhere said: I should create a new topic: Romance of the three optical giants: Taylor Hobson, Schneider and Leica. \ud83d\ude04 Tears Everywhere, you seem to have a lot of material.

Long ago I selected Adobe Lightroom to manage my photos - bought the software, and it was mine to use, until I bought an even newer version of Lightroom. Lightroom allowed me to move my images into a logical location on my computer, keep track of images, so I could find them in the future, and edit the images. My thoughts on this changed when adobe went to a subscription mode, so I would be paying a monthly fee to adobe from then on, forever. I'm still paying, but I want to eventually get out. Early this year, I bought my Leica M10, and created a new file storage location on my computer. I wasn't sure what program I would use for editing, but after trying several, I settled on PhotoLab 3, which recently became PhotoLab 4. PhotoLab is an image editor. It doesn't replace the full Lightroom system including where and how to store images. I create folders where I want, and copy my new photos there using my own organization system so I can find them later. I followed the same format for photo organization as I have been using in Lightroom, separating images by country, then by the year they were taken, then by the location/purpose for the photos. This has worked for me over all these years in Lightroom, and I replicated it with a brand new top level folder for PhotoLab IMAGE TRANSFER: How the images got from my memory card onto the computer was and still is handled by one of my favorite programs, Photo Mechanic. Photo Mechanic \"ingests\" the images from the card, and quickly allows me to delete the junk images should I wish to. It is very fast, even with hundreds of RAW images. It can rename the images as they are ingested into something more useful than the ordinary file name, and it allows me to add lots of information to the \"metadata\", doing all this to every image as it is ingested. After image review, until this year, I would then use Lightrooom's \"Import\" tools to get these images into my Lightroom System. For other editors, such as Luminar or PhotoLab, I can move the images into an appropriate folder, in a location where I hope to be able to find those images years from now. NEW: Camera Bits, the company that provides PhotoMechanic, has now released PhotoMechanic Plus - which combines the previous software with a new DAM system (Digital Asset Management). This does what Lightroom used to do for me, and goes far beyond it. From what I've read, I will easily be able to find my photos based on many criteria. Since I'm new at this, and am still learning, instead of describing it in my words, I'll just post this link: https://home.camerabits.com/tour-photo-mechanic-plus/ People have told me that my photo organization is essentially the same as what my parents and grandparents did, placing photos in a shoe box with a label. At first I laughed, but not any more. My life seems to have changed so much now - taking photos with the Leica, editing them in my new software, and using the DAM function to allow me to find my images in the future - and all of it I \"own\" (well, the license, not the software), no need to make any monthly payments so that it can/will continue. Having said all that, how do the rest of you deal with this?

Early on, I auditioned Capture One. at the time it was clear that it was geared for studio shooting and had no DAM component so I gave up on it. I tried apple's pro photo software and found that also wanting. I settled on Lightroom primarily because I needed to be able to organize and retrieve the thousands of images I was creating as an architectural photographer and also for my personal work. I give Adobe a lot of credit for understanding very early on that we creatives are a messy, unorganized bunch that need all the help they can get in an easy and intuitive way. I grew up shooting slide film so have always been very good at getting the exposure right in camera. so my primary need was organizational, that being said, I have only shot raw since my first digital SLR, the canon Eos 2oD so the raw conversion has and still is a very important factor for me. I have stuck with Lightroom all these years because it gets me as a photographer, - from organizing to raw conversion to printing. Like you I balked at the thought of paying a subscription fee but at the end of the day I've come to realize that that is the same model I use in the rest of my life.
