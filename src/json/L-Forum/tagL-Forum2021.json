I understand there is no disadvantage compared to auto iso (capped at 1600, like me), but is there rang advantage to this ? On older sensors, \"ISO\" (aka signal amplification) was performed pre-ADC (analogue to digital conversion) Kinda like the RAW software on your computer was given a recipe with the RAW file that indicated how much it needed brightening as it was demosaiced. If you under exposed in camera, then you got noise. If you then brightened that image in LR/PS/whatever you amplified the noise to a level that was worse than if you'd told the camera to brighten the image at time of capture Modern sensors are known as ISO invariant. Which means there's no pre-ADC amplification at all, which means push it x stops on the ISO dial or push it x stops on the exposure slider in front of your computer = all roads lead to Rome. But that said, there's often still tags/instructions in the RAW that say (sic) things to the RAW software like if the ISO is >x, then apply z amount of NR. So under exposing in camera and sorting it all out in post can leave you a little more in control of the NR process. But you're not going to see a night and day difference between doing one or the other on a modern camera. There's a slight complication that some sensors have dual gain, which means two levels of amplification (Sony sensors IIRC), with a swap at iso800 or whatever, so it can sometimes pay to be mindful of the cut over point... But really this is just geeky stuff and it doesn't really matter (the photo does not the camera setting) It's a little bit like the SS dial vs aperture mode with the EV dial. Both ways use the camera's light meter, both ways give the photographer the opportunity to direct the shutter speed to their desired value. It's just two different ways of achieving the same thing TL:DR (don't blame you) Old cameras were like a cake recipe that needed 3 eggs, if you only used two you were kinda screwed to get the third egg in there after the cake came out of the oven \ud83d\ude05 New cameras are like a prebaked cake that needs icing.

So long as you go into the lens list and change the setting with every lens change. The M10 (at least) will allow you to select the pre-ASPH 35 Summilux from the menu, even though that is not a codable lens: \"35 f/1.4 11869/11870/11860.\" Same for the 50mm Summiluxes 11868/11856/11114 2) If you are using an M10 variant, you effectively get ONE \"freebie\" lens ID to intermix with your coded lenses. The M10 firmware will swap automatically between coded lenses - and any one uncoded lens that remains \"permanently\" assigned in the lens menu (until you change the lens menu setting yourself). E.G. I have coded lenses 21/28/35/75/90 - and an \"uncodable\" 135 TE. I leave the camera's lens menu set to Manual M - \"135mm Tele-Elmar f/4.0\" If I mount any of my coded lenses, the M10 automatically detects the coding, and uses that, ignoring the menu setting. If I switch to my 135 (or any uncoded lens), the M10 automatically detects an uncoded lens. And automatically uses the current menu selection. So using the 135 is as \"seamless\" as if it were coded (just swap and shoot - no menu-diving at all). 3) For the most part, the critical effects of the coding or menu selection (correction of Italian-flag color stains with wide-angles) are reasonably swappable between similar optical designs. I.E. the menu setting for the 35 Summicron v.4 works just fine with a 35mm Summicron v.3 or v.2 (and probably fine for the v.1 8-element as well, although I haven't tried it). They are all 6/7/8-element double-gauss lenses.

A snippet of my last campaign can be seen below. These gigs are mostly one-man-band endeavours that I really enjoy (often, travelling and tons of hiking involved). In March, I bought the SL2-S for such projects. Why the SL2-S and not a Sony, Canon or Panasonic camera? First, I'm a skin tone aficionado; and I have a clear idea of what sky blue should look like. For me, Arri is the only manufacturer who nails that convincingly. Their price tag is prohibitive, plus there are millions of other reasons why not to carry such a camera with you. Overall, after looking intensively over half a year into the primary Japanese cameras, I ended up with Leica because Leica's take on colours closely matches my idea of colour. Plus, the SL-line feels unbreakable and shows no issues with inclement weather (following my star, I tend to take my gear to unpleasant places without much thinking). Secondly, I needed a zoom lens that renders particularly dimensional images, helping to draw the audience into the video's story. I've worked with Canon's and Nikon's offerings in the 24-70 area. I find that they don't have much of a personality besides being sharp. However, the 24-90 Elmarit SL zoom tics the dimensionality box impressively, showing some character. Still, it sports the usual AF-based, dreadful fly-by-wire focusing that makes manual focussing a woeful experience, albeit the adjustable focus-throw settings help a bit. But after some time, I adjusted to the 24-90's manual focusing and stopped complaining. But why is the focus peaking turned down when the camera isn't rolling but works in its full glory (almost too much) when shooting? That should be fixed in a firmware update. I use Leica's L-log because it offers the broadest dynamic range, leaving no questions. It took me some time to figure out what exactly L-log is. Long story short: L-log is a 10 bit-optimised log curve living in the large HDR Rec 2020 colour space. That's why, without the Rec 709 LUT, the colours are way off in regular SDR HD. But for the best colours and best dynamic range, working in the camera's native colour space Rec 2020 is advisable (could also be ACES). Most NLE support that large colour space; after all, it's the future's video standard. On the footage side, the Sl2-S delivers footage like a little cine camera. The best dynamic range with a subtle texture can be obtained at ISO 800, my go-to ISO setting for almost everything. At ISO 6400, the footage looks still pretty good. In that area, the SL2-S outperforms Arri and any other cine camera I know. Deliberate underexposed by two stops, video sequences with ISO set at 800 can be brought back without any colour shifts and noticeable noise. Four stops underexposed will show some colour shift in the footage and noise. At 6 stops, the video image is grainy, shows pronounced colour shifts and isn't usable anymore. That is pretty remarkable. I've shot this video with the SL2-S, including the stills. A few easy to spot stock scenes are included. As I would do with an Arri Alexa, the exposure factored in the sky's bright highlights: A wish list for the next firmware update: In L-Log, focus peaking when idle as pronounced as when rolling Braw or ProRes Raw recording via HDMI Improved AF-C (in its current state, it's unusable in video mode) When thinking about a future SL3-S, I could imagine this: 6K/4K ProRes 444 and ProRes Raw internally Snappy and harmoniously moving AF-C, mimicking manual focus pulls ACES IDT and a 12 Bit log curve similar to Arri C-Log. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/326478-video-and-stills-sl2-s-as-a-hybrid-camera/?tab=comments#comment-4312074", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": " from time to time, i create social media campaigns on landscape conservation and climate protection. a snippet of my last campaign can be seen below. these gigs are mostly one-man-band endeavours that i really enjoy (often, travelling and tons of hiking involved). in march, i bought the sl2-s for such projects. why the sl2-s and not a sony, canon or panasonic camera? first, i'm a skin tone aficionado; and i have a clear idea of what sky blue should look like. for me, arri is the only manufacturer who nails that convincingly. their price -----> tag !!!  is prohibitive, plus there are millions of other reasons why not to carry such a camera with you. overall, after looking intensively over half a year into the primary japanese cameras, i ended up with leica because leica's take on colours closely matches my idea of colour. plus, the sl-line feels unbreakable and shows no issues with inclement weather (following my star, i tend to take my gear to unpleasant places without much thinking). secondly, i needed a zoom lens that renders particularly dimensional images, helping to draw the audience into the video's story. i've worked with canon's and nikon's offerings in the 24-70 area. i find that they don't have much of a personality besides being sharp. however, the 24-90 elmarit sl zoom tics the dimensionality box impressively, showing some character. still, it sports the usual af-based, dreadful fly-by-wire focusing that makes manual focussing a woeful experience, albeit the adjustable focus-throw settings help a bit. but after some time, i adjusted to the 24-90's manual focusing and stopped complaining. but why is the focus peaking turned down when the camera isn't rolling but works in its full glory (almost too much) when shooting? that should be fixed in a firmware update. i use leica's l-log because it offers the broadest dynamic range, leaving no questions. it took me some time to figure out what exactly l-log is. long story short: l-log is a 10 bit-optimised log curve living in the large hdr rec 2020 colour space. that's why, without the rec 709 lut, the colours are way off in regular sdr hd. but for the best colours and best dynamic range, working in the camera's native colour space rec 2020 is advisable (could also be aces). most nle support that large colour space; after all, it's the future's video standard. on the footage side, the sl2-s delivers footage like a little cine camera. the best dynamic range with a subtle texture can be obtained at iso 800, my go-to iso setting for almost everything. at iso 6400, the footage looks still pretty good. in that area, the sl2-s outperforms arri and any other cine camera i know. deliberate underexposed by two stops, video sequences with iso set at 800 can be brought back without any colour shifts and noticeable noise. four stops underexposed will show some colour shift in the footage and noise. at 6 stops, the video image is grainy, shows pronounced colour shifts and isn't usable anymore. that is pretty remarkable. i've shot this video with the sl2-s, including the stills. a few easy to spot stock scenes are included. as i would do with an arri alexa, the exposure factored in the sky's bright highlights: a wish list for the next firmware update: in l-log, focus peaking when idle as pronounced as when rolling braw or prores raw recording via hdmi improved af-c (in its current state, it's unusable in video mode) when thinking about a future sl3-s, i could imagine this: 6k/4k prores 444 and prores raw internally snappy and harmoniously moving af-c, mimicking manual focus pulls aces idt and a 12 bit log curve similar to arri c-log. --img-- ", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 28375, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 415840, "autor": "Slender", "date": 1615378860000, "content": "Hey you know waht should we find people and write a joint email to Lockcircle pledging to buy their cages together (they make a nice grouped sale) if they take the \"stupid\" label off the price tag?

Similar to the early 2000\u2019s shooting an M-4 with film and the 50 Summicron (v 4) and 35 Summicron ASPH, I shoot many of the R lenses at f/4 or f/5.6. In this range the R lenses are superb. No, they are not crisp on the corners like the SL primes, but they are 20 to 30 years older. The fact that they hold up now is incredible (IMHO). I even played with the (R\u2019s) 50 cron at 2.8 and 28mm v1 at 2.8 and they were excellent in the middle. If I am concerned with corners, I use newer R lenses at f/8 or so. For example, the 35-70 f/4 lens (a lot like the M MATE) is great at f/8 for crisp outlines. The APO 90 is incredible, but one of the newest R lenses and like the M. The 35 elmarit v2 has a lot of distortion, so I shoot it level, but the 28 elmarit v1 is so incredibly small that I prefer it over the v2 larger with the unwieldy lens hood that pulls out and doesn\u2019t lock. Other incredible lenses are the APO 180 f/2.8 at all f/stops. I like the 280 f/2.8, early version with the APO 1.4x for wildlife, again not for landscapes and corners, but middle focus. The best part about R lenses is the color correction. It was originally set for slide film and I actually set the saturation in lightroom to zero or negative just a little. Also, because it is set for slide film, my opinion is the shadows are a little darker and harder to recapture. But I know that going in and set my exposure accordingly. The colors are just super. I think this is what translated over to the S glass, because of the OVF of the S system, distortion was a priority as was color rendition. What you see is what you get (after the sensor plays with it of course). Overall, I echo the 60mm f/2.8 macro is a great lens and much sharper corner to corner than the 50 cron, but a little harsher on bokeh. For a great, inexpensive R lens the 90 Elmarit v2 is great and just about the same as the M lens (which I also love). It\u2019s harder to find ROM lenses now, but the ROM adds a lot to using with the SL series because it records the lens. I got lucky and found a really clean version of the 28 Elmarit v1 lense with ROM. I want a 280 f/2.8 with ROM but its too expensive just to get the ROM. I have a 70-180 AP f/2.8, which is \u201caffordable\u201d compared to the 35-70 f/2.8 (crazy expensive) and that lens is really nice with colors at the beach. I\u2019d say, if you can give up weather sealing., autofocus and absolute corner sharpness wide open, the R lenses are great alternatives.
