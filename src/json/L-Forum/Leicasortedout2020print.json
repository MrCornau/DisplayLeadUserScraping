I've ran a roll through mine with version 2 of the spool and it works pretty good, but i'm working on version 3 which should be better still - I got the dimensions slightly wrong on this one - it's too short. How many of you CL owners would be interested in buying such an item? They'd cost around \u00a320 and be sold through eBay all said and done, and I'd make a video showing how to take apart the CL and install them, as well as reassembly - International shipping would happen too through the eBay GSP as I'm UK based. The attached photo is version 2 and not by any means the final version as this is still in very early development, but the quality of the ones that go on sale will be much higher.

I set about a project with medium format (using my 6x9 Fuji 'Texas Leica') that I was convinced needed film edges so got a Betterscanning film holder for my Epson V700. There were two things wrong in my planning, the first was I wanted to carry as little as possible, so no tripod with a spirit level, the second is that I can't stand sloping horizons in the larger formats, 35mm I feel is a bit freer. And of course every now and again I'd have a good shot and then no way to correct the horizon because of the film edge. So I cheated, I straightened and cropped the image and used Silver Efex Pro that has a tool to create an infinite number of user defined film edge effects and I got one to match, well nearly match.

Alan has done some amazing work for me, like working out how to rebuild my giant rangefinder Combat Graflex 70mm film camera from a 1950's US Navy manual, including having to get unobtainable broken parts 3D printed in titanium. Wilson I sent my IIIf in to Cameraworks for repair and got a message from Alan today, things aren\u2019t as bad as I thought and he has quoted a very reasonable cost for the repair.
