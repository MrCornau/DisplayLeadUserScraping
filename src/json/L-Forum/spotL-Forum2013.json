I know because I did it last night without thinking and couldn't remove my Bellows II.--img--  The M240's lens release button has a metal collar and the bellows's rear plate fits so closely to it without touching it that I couldn't even insert a knife blade between the two (I tried). \"What did you do?\" I hear you ask. Well, I took the M240 and Bellows II combo to Red Dot Cameras, where I had bought the camera, prepared to be without my camera while it was returned to Solms for a 'Bellows-ectomy'. I showed Ivor, the co-proprietor, and he fixed it on the spot by removing a shroud from the bellows with a tiny screwdriver to remove two tiny screws and a set of circlip pliers to unscrew the shroud, which gave access to the lens release button. I asked Ivor how he knew how to remove the shroud to take the bellows off and he laughed heartily and said that he'd done the same thing himself and thought it needed to be sent back to Solms until he started taking the bellows apart and found how to fix it.

This is sensor dirt. All digital cameras with interchangeable lenses have this problem, but an M is particularly prone, because there is no mirror as extra barrier and the lack of an AA filter makes the dirt more visible. One should prevent dust from entering the camera as much as possible. There are a number of strategies. 1. Avoid changing lenses more than necessary. 2. Change lenses in as much of a dust-free environment as possible 3. Keep the rear end of the lens as clean as possible 4. Change the lens with the camera mouth facing downwards 5. (This may be a myth) Switch off the camera before changing lenses. But dust will come on the sensor anyway. The Leica M has a dust detection system that will help you locate the dust. Consult the manual to find the sensor cleaning item in the menu and use a FULLY charged battery. Before opening the shutter blow out the camera (using a bulb blower, not compressed air or your mouth!) to dislodge any loose dust. If the dust on the sensor is loose one can blow off the sensor using a good bulb blower, (Rocket Blower by Giotto for instance) with the camera mouth facing downwards. If that does not clear the problem there are sensor brushes like the Arctic Butterfly by Visible Dust that are quite effective or the little vacuum cleaner by Green Clean. At this stage the use of a Sensor Loupe can be very helpful. If spots on the sensor persist you are dealing with stuck dirt like pollen or oil spots and need to revert to wet cleaning. There are numerous threads on the subject. The Visible Dust products are highly recommended or the Green Clean wet-and-dry method. Use a proper solvent for grease if you think you are dealing with oil etc. (Visible Dust Smear Away or Dust-Aid Sensor Clean (my preference) Open the shutter for cleaning and blow it once again with a bulb blower or vacuum clean it, to remove any loose particles which might be dragged across the sensor and cause scratches. Although the M is full frame and there are size 1 sensor swabs on the market, I prefer using the swabs for 1.3 sensors (and APS-C swabs for the M8) Take a clean swab, put on three small drops of Sensor Cleaning Fluid and in two sweeps, top and bottow go to one side - do not over-press!!- and sweep back again, using the other side of the swab automatically. Or, using the wet-and-dry system, swab with the wet sponge and dry with a couple of sweeps with the dry swab. Don't let the fluid spill over the edge of the sensor too much - there are electronic connections there. That is all - close the shutter and test the camera by taking an unfocussed image of an evenly lit surface at the smallest aperture. In the unlikely case it is needed, repeat. There are other cleaning systems, like stamping the dust away, but my personal experience with those was not very good. Others, including Leica Customer Service seem to be quite happy using them, so it is clearly a matter of preference. Nevertheless with such systems wet cleaning will become unavoidable at a certain point. There are also sensor cleaning services or Leica Customer Service, but those are expensive and will keep the camera for a while. They may also not be readily available if one is travelling. Sensor cleaning is something any owner should be able to do himself. If you are fairly certain your spots are oil or grease, it may be wise to omit the step with the Arctic Butterfly, as it may become contaminated by the grease. In case that happens it can be cleaned with the special fluid provided.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/216580-leica-m8-m82-m9-m9p-mm-mtyp240-faqs-questions-with-answers/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-2464169", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "spots", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": " question: there are -----> spots !!!  on my images, especially at small apertures. this is sensor dirt. all digital cameras with interchangeable lenses have this problem, but an m is particularly prone, because there is no mirror as extra barrier and the lack of an aa filter makes the dirt more visible. one should prevent dust from entering the camera as much as possible. there are a number of strategies. 1. avoid changing lenses more than necessary. 2. change lenses in as much of a dust-free environment as possible 3. keep the rear end of the lens as clean as possible 4. change the lens with the camera mouth facing downwards 5.

I will inform all on their response when I receive one: Dear Software Team: The following are my observations of my perceived flaws with the current version 1.0 firmware: 1. Auto Focus is relatively slow, especially compared to Olympus EM-5, EM-1 and Panasonic GX-7. In bright daylight it can struggle to find focus and this appears to be caused by the lens stopping down prior to focusing rather than focusing wide open and then stopping down to shoot. 2. Auto Focus misses focus frequently enough to not be trusted, often selecting a higher contrast part of the image outside of the focus rectangle, even when spot focus is selected. Face detect frequently struggles to find and lock on faces and miss focuses. Every single mode, 1-Point, 11-Point, Spot and Face Detect have focusing errors. Low contrast subject appear to be especially challenging unless there is a high contrast vertical line in the focus area. 3. The absence of DOF information makes using zone focusing a challenge. Further the camera does not display on the LCD or EVF the selected focus distance. Displaying a combination of focus distance and depth of field for the selected aperture and focal length would be extremely valuable. 4. Start up time from power on is slow, but even worse is wake-up time from sleep. It can take much longer than the time it takes to do a 1/2 press and raise the camera to eye level for the camera to wake up and this results in many missed shots. 5. Auto ISO needs to have faster shutter speed options than 1/30sec. We should be able to select up to at least 1/250sec. Sometimes we have moving subjects that we don't want blurred. 6. We need a way to scroll (playback) through images while magnified. It is very irritating to have to negatively zoom the image in order to select the next image and then zoom it to try and compare focus. 7. The highest magnification level produces pixilated images that are of little use to determine focus accuracy. One should be able to go to the highest magnification and see a clean and sharp image. Other cameras are capable so there is no reason the X Vario shouldn't be able to do the same. 8. A faster way to change metering mode would be useful. Presently one has to go into the menu to change metering mode. Perhaps the down position on the silver disc could be used to select metering mode and then the dial under the thumb could select the desired mode or multiple presses of the down position. 9. Displaying, actual histogram that will appear in the captured image as opposed to a wide open histogram would be very useful. 10. Adding focus peaking with the ability to select the peaking color would be very useful as a MF aid. 11. Support for the Olympus VF-4, EVF. The current VF-2 EVF lacks resolution, contrast and color accuracy, it is only barely usable. It also can be difficult to switch between the EVF and LCD, sometimes taking multiple button pushes. While there are other irritations in the way the menu items are selected and the inconsistency between the Leica M menu and the X Vario menu are selected, that would be secondary to addressing the issues above. The largest area of complaint on the Leica forum is the auto focus speed and accuracy issues. If I could only have those issues addressed I would find the camera a camera to rave about despite its slow lens and noise at higher ISOs. The other items mentioned above would go a long way toward improving the camera and making it a true photographers instrument. Is there any chance that you are working to address any of these issues? Can we expect a firmware update in the near future that will address these issues? Could you provide any details on which issues Leica sees as priorities and when they might be made available? Finally, if you need a beta tester, I am available and would provide detailed feedback.

Every other images as tack sharp. My test images were a test pattern, a head shot of my wife and a friend, another test image and a group of objects to test for 3-D focusing. I used every AF method from facial recognition to spot. They all focused equally well though some were faster than others. I tested at all 4 focal lengths to make sure it wasn't focal length related. The blank grey wall test using natural window light with the wall defocused at each focal length illustrated erratic WB behavior and that is evident in the test shots of the blank walls and the black & white test chart. On shooting the color images, the erratic WB behavior seems to disappear. I'm not sure why. WB was easily corrected by selecting auto in LR for both JPGs and DNGs. Lastly, I discovered that the files contain corrective information for both RAW and JPG that LR applies without telling you or allowing you to turn off if you choose. Loading the same files into Iridient Developer allows one to turn off lens correction for the XV profile and it becomes apparent that the lens suffers from moderate to very mild barrel distortion running from wide to tele. This was a surprising finding given the Peter Karbe interview and his statement about their design goals. At least that is what I am seeing.
