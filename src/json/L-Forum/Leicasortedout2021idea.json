So the time was now (well then, aw you get what I mean) A low mileage official dealer supplied example came up at the right time and as they say on forums such as this I pulled the trigger Now truth be told I expected to use the M9 a bit like a classic sports' car (not that I own one) - sunny Sunday drives down country lanes, with a modern practical car for everyday. Long story short, I quickly became seduced by using a rangefinder, the cerebral challenges of a simple camera, and well boy meets Leica M - a story as old as the hills. My other brand cameras were relegated to the gear cupboard and the M9 and I partied like it was 2009 Of course the M9 does have some limitations, and I found myself wanting and needing something a little more modern for certain things. Enter the M240. I bought this camera because it was comparatively cheap, and had more ISO which I needed. Whereas I quite liked the 240, I never loved it. I found it quite hard work. Sure it performed better than the M9 with DR and ISO and I was glad of that. But the files needed more work in post, the camera was less nice in the hand and well.. we got on well enough but but it wasn't love I decided to see what the M11 did to M10 prices on the used market. About a month later my local AD got a secondhand M10 in, factory refurbished with new top and bottom plates (I don't want to know why it needed those....), the so important to me, warranty and at a price that was merely excruciating rather than terminal. I bounced into the store as they opened and... ...no M10 Sold? Nope - reserved for someone. You'll have to wait a week to see if I can sell to you It was a long week, that ended with a mad dash across the city to catch the store before closing. (Guy it was reserved for ended up buying a new m10R instead) I had a couple of DMs from folks asking about the whole M9/240/M10 comparison thing (which I've replied too), so that's not really what this missive is and besides that's all been done before I think? Also of course the early and mid adopters of the M10 have already shared their reviews and thoughts, so possibly I've little to add of value. But that said! I'm really very happy with the M10! My first concern was the reduced battery life compared to the 240.. well it is less, but as I'm not much of a chimper, tend to switch my camera off between shots, don't own the EVF, seldom use live view and can't be bothered to install the phone app thing = my battery life is great \ud83d\ude01 Usually about 650-750 shots. The headline feature of the M10 is that it's thinner. I'm genuinely surprised at how much I notice this and how much better it feels in my hand than the 240 (I have small hands) - of course the weight distribution helps here too, the M10 has better balance than the 240 (less front heavy, and mass concentrated into a smaller area feels more nimble, it's a technique used in sports motorcycle design) The next headline feature (I guess) is the improved viewfinder. I didn't notice this in the store, but it's tangibly bigger and easier to use. I don't wear glasses, but I do wear sun glasses a lot and it's a lot nicer to use wearing them, 35mm framelines work better for me too. But I guess the key upgrade reason was the ISO improvements and what the internet seems to have dubbed the colour science Lets start with the ISO. This is easy. Yeah it's a ton better. And not just more ISO less noise better, but more exposure push in post, image doesn't end up with more banding than a field of Zebras better. Massive score IMO Re colours.. well when I go through my LR catalogue thumbnails it's not always completely obvious if I'm looking at a M10 or 240 shot... the colours are not poles apart, but I find the M10 DNGs nicer to work on, there's a lot of pleasing (to me) pop and contrast and bite from the off. Skins tones of the people I shoot look better to me (and them) too. In fact a custom DCP and a preset with a little contrast gets me most of the way there during DNG import, personally (OMMV) I found the 240 images were a lot more case by case with different images needing quite separate types of work to get what I liked. This was the main thing I missed from the M9 (which I still have) with the 240. It was just how the M9 images usually arrived pretty close to being usable (or completely useless), whereas always the 240 demanded work (obviously YMMV, you may use different tools or the same tools in a better way) In fact I've little to complain about with the M10 (well the price \ud83d\ude44) and of course all the things that you've read on here already, the too stiff to lift ISO dial, the missing (for me, YMMV) cont/timed modes on the power switch (especially as timed isn't retained if you power off) - menu diving isn't what I associate with Leica... There's only really one fly in my personal M10 ointment (which I knew about before I bought it, not complaining too heavily, honest) Who's clucking bright idea was it too make base ISO inaccessible? WTAF? As you all know, you face a choice ISO 100 and don't dare clip a highlight or ISO 200 and hope the shadows aren't too murky if you need to recover them heavily Which, to me at least, makes ISO selection important for scenes where frankly it should be set base and forget (a colour RAW histogram might help here too...) But I can't stress enough... the camera is a tool, they all have foibles and we need to learn to use them to get what we want. So in some sort of summary The M10 compared to the M9. There's only one M9. The M10 isn't like an M9 v2.0 or something. It's just closer than the 240 was. The M9 colours are great and everything, but for me the M9 magic is the tonality, the glowing colours and airy light pictures. The M10 compared to the M240 On paper there's very little in it, but sincerely all those little improvements really do add up. The IQ is tangibly better, the ISO is far more usable, and it's just a nicer object to hold and use. (Which is important, cars get bought cos of the spec - they get sold if they're uncomfortable to drive) The M10 compared to the M11 ahahaha just messing - ask Jono or someone And that's the thing... Soon enough arrives the M11 Many here will get one, and I guess some you will use the opportunity to get an M10... Getting a camera that's not a current model has more than just price benefits... the firmware is mature, manufacturing bugs should be eliminated and the forums are full of tips and tricks for getting the most out of it written by people that have shot with one for some years If you've sat on the fence about the M10 and are figuring that now might be the time to jump, well I sincerely believe that you'll be happy with it.

I try a lot lenses with this camera and for sure it influences the results a lot. The M10 delivers its magic in colors with some specials lenses like the summilux 35 and an adequate light. In fact the m lenses are so good that you can get a close result to the M10 with the SL1. A SL could even be a cheap alternativ to a m10 for someone who like to use some Leica M lenses \ud83d\ude09 Not exactly 1:1 but a great option indeed. The sl1 is still a brillant camera.

In fact a custom DCP and a preset with a little contrast gets me most of the way there during DNG import, personally (OMMV) I found the 240 images were a lot more case by case with different images needing quite separate types of work to get what I liked. This was the main thing I missed from the M9 (which I still have) with the 240. It was just how the M9 images usually arrived pretty close to being usable (or completely useless), whereas always the 240 demanded work (obviously YMMV, you may use different tools or the same tools in a better way) In fact I've little to complain about with the M10 (well the price \ud83d\ude44) and of course all the things that you've read on here already, the too stiff to lift ISO dial, the missing (for me, YMMV) cont/timed modes on the power switch (especially as timed isn't retained if you power off) - menu diving isn't what I associate with Leica... There's only really one fly in my personal M10 ointment (which I knew about before I bought it, not complaining too heavily, honest) Who's clucking bright idea was it too make base ISO inaccessible? WTAF? As you all know, you face a choice ISO 100 and don't dare clip a highlight or ISO 200 and hope the shadows aren't too murky if you need to recover them heavily Which, to me at least, makes ISO selection important for scenes where frankly it should be set base and forget (a colour RAW histogram might help here too...) But I can't stress enough... the camera is a tool, they all have foibles and we need to learn to use them to get what we want. So in some sort of summary The M10 compared to the M9. There's only one M9. The M10 isn't like an M9 v2.0 or something. It's just closer than the 240 was. The M9 colours are great and everything, but for me the M9 magic is the tonality, the glowing colours and airy light pictures. The M10 compared to the M240 On paper there's very little in it, but sincerely all those little improvements really do add up. The IQ is tangibly better, the ISO is far more usable, and it's just a nicer object to hold and use. (Which is important, cars get bought cos of the spec - they get sold if they're uncomfortable to drive) The M10 compared to the M11 ahahaha just messing - ask Jono or someone And that's the thing... Soon enough arrives the M11 Many here will get one, and I guess some you will use the opportunity to get an M10... Getting a camera that's not a current model has more than just price benefits... the firmware is mature, manufacturing bugs should be eliminated and the forums are full of tips and tricks for getting the most out of it written by people that have shot with one for some years If you've sat on the fence about the M10 and are figuring that now might be the time to jump, well I sincerely believe that you'll be happy with it. I know I am Thanks for reading. Thanks you for sharing. I agree with you the M10 is a great camera. i don\u2019t thing we need anything else as the regular M10. I try a lot lenses with this camera and for sure it influences the results a lot. The M10 delivers its magic in colors with some specials lenses like the summilux 35 and an adequate light. In fact the m lenses are so good that you can get a close result to the M10 with the SL1. A SL could even be a cheap alternativ to a m10 for someone who like to use some Leica M lenses \ud83d\ude09 Not exactly 1:1 but a great option indeed. The sl1 is still a brillant camera.

The reason Leitz used a big, overbuilt, slow running shutter in an M3 was to make it more robust, more reliable & more durable.

I shoot with some Nikon bodies already on film and the same with digital. And then i have the Leica Q-P which i like a lot.

But just throwing it out there as sort of making my brainstorming for this situation a little easier I have been toying with the idea of maybe trading or selling my Q-P to finance or trade for a Leica M4 or M6. My thinking at first was to get an M6 with maybe one lens. Or the M4 in great condition with a kit of lenses or one very good leica lens. First of all i shoot both film and digital. I shoot with some Nikon bodies already on film and the same with digital. And then i have the Leica Q-P which i like a lot. So the only reason id sell the Q-P would be to get another Leica, and its at the moment my only way of financing the better Leica M bodies so im just thinking about that now and going back and forth over the pros and cons. I have an offer for a black repainted M4 with Three lenses. The Minolta 28 f2,8, the 35 ultra voigtl\u00e4nder f1,7 and the Nikkor 50 f2,0.

Me wanting to sell the Noct f1 is more than just it's lack of use, as I use my 75lux even less. Last year a went about a lens cull and sold half my lenses because they sat unused. Some were limited edition stuff that I'd baby too much. Sometimes I'd use those \"extra\" lenses for the sake of it and I've also had a bit of bad luck with these \"superfluous\" lenses (those lenses which overlapped with my core group i.e. 35lux/50apo/28cron) in the past as I've had a couple of them develop wobbly lens barrels, oil on blades, nicks on the lens barrel and sometimes obvious dust finds their way into the lenses despite my fastidiousness in relation to my gear. As a result, I feel \"less gear = potential less issues\". While I regret selling some of them because they're difficult to find now and prices have climbed, I've never really been in it for the money/investment aspect but more for different looks and qualities. This is why I kept the Noct f1 in spite of it being a bit more of a rarity nowadays compared to my other lenses. It's signature is just so unique. I must say the cutting down of lenses has made me happier and in this fresh bout of wanting to cut down I've also considered selling my M10-D (leaving me with just an M10M). The idea of a trimmer lineup makes photography more enjoyable for me because it's easier to not be distracted by choice, though I suppose this isn't really the issue at hand because I'd be replacing the Noct f1 with another lens. That said, if it were a lower cost alternative i'd be less inclined to baby the lens and might bring it out more, particularly if its lighter and there is some appeal there. The Noct f1 makes an easy target to sell because of the existence of the 75lux in my kit and my preference to its rendering despite the focal length. Also, the whole love-hate relationship with the Noct f1, as I usually don't have that many gripes with a lens I intend to keep long term. On the flip side, I must say I'm more inclined to keep the lens now than before. It's a lens for mood days and I'm more of a Karbe guy (though in my heart it's the Mandler glass that I really have a soft spot for, e.g. 75lux and this Noct), so even if i had something smaller i don't think i'd use it that much more. I wouldn't be any happier with the money in the bank. This discussion on a Noct replacement made me remember why I kept it during my cull last year and why it's been my mainstay sole Mandler lens for the past 5 years (until I finally found a 75lux which was perfectly calibrated last year after quite a bit of searching). With the Noct f1, it is full on Mandler, the super charged Mandler lens and the ultimate tonic for my Mandler days. If I only had one Mandler lens, it'd be this lens. As for alternatives suggested, I did try the 50lux BC before in view of replacing the 50lux (standard) I had but stuck with the standard version because I didn't like the added heft. I would consider using one more extensively to re-assess how I feel about it now that my standard 50lux has been sold and because that black chrome 50lux is such a beautiful lens. I don't think it'd be a replacement for the Noct f1 though as I find their signatures too different. IMO same could be said about the Konica Hexanons. I've always wanted to try the 50 1.2 and 60 1.2 (v2) but I've always seen them as add-ons to my lens lineup rather than substitutes. I did own a 35 f2 UC-Hexanon once and really liked the rendering (I presume it shares similar DNA to the fast 50/60mms and from photos I've seen on the web I see some similarities) but it was never a replacement for any of my past or current lenses. I think my best bets for as close a Noct f1 replacement would probably be a 50lux pre-asph, likely a v1 going by the comments and pics I've seen. I'd have to find one to shoot for a more extended period to see if I can sell the f1 for it. Or not touch any of those \"alternative\" lenses at all. Maybe a beater Summar can be found for some fun.

When I get ready to write a report, the first thing I do is to go through the images taken with the camera / lens and make some basic picks to give me ideas about what to write. In this instance the pictures seemed like a glimpse into another world, the world of Cornish beaches and moorland in summer sunshine (actually, it rains much of the time, but that isn't what the pictures say). A lot of the pictures in the attached gallery were shot wide open, which adds to the dreamlike feeling surrounding them. On the other hand, social distancing was definitely the order of the day, so people pictures are few and far between So here is a short report to celebrate the release of the new APO Summicron SL 28mm f2 Asph The 28mm is the 5th lens in the APO SL Summicron lineup. There will be more wide angle lenses released during the next year or so, while the 35, 50, 75 and 90 have already been released. The Lens As expected, the APO-Summicron-SL 28 f2 Asph is exactly the same form factor as the previous APO Summicrons, (and the future ones as well). The optical design varies between the lenses: in this case it is 13 elements in 10 groups with 3 aspherical lenses and 6 aspherical surfaces. 8 of the elements are made with anomalous partial dispersion glass, which helps to completely remove any colour fringing. The minimum focus distance is 0.24metres, allowing a magnification of 0.2x (as the other SL Summicrons). The lens weighs in at a little over 700gm (without lens hood), not light perhaps, but it balances perfectly on the SL2 (and the SL2-S) and is fine for a full days shooting. Manual Focus is 'focus by wire', but using an innovative system with a magnetic focusing ring, this changes it's polarity when the ring is turned. By default this causes an acceleration if the rotational speed is faster. However, with the SL2 and SL2-s you can now make the focus action linear and decide between focus throws from 90-360 deg in a number of steps. The lens uses the same 'Dual Syncro Drive' motor as the other SL Summicrons and shares their excellent Auto Focus performance (fast enough and very accurate). APO Lenses, Contrast and Depth of Field The almost zero aberrations (especially chromatic aberrations) in the new Summicron SL lenses means a big increase in contrast where the image is in focus. As you move away from the point of perfect focus the contrast drops sharply. This means that the transition between \u2018sharp\u2019 and \u2018bokeh\u2019 is defined more quickly and results in smoother out of focus areas than in conventional lenses. I have a diagram drawn for me by Peter Karbe in my notebook, but here is the graph from the Leica website comparing the APO Summicron SL 75 with the Summilux M 75. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> The result of this is not just that the 75 APO SL is sharper (it certainly is), but that it has apparently the same DOF as the 75 Summilux-M. The MTF figures for the 50 APO are even better, and so the effect is even more visible. So we have a series of modestly sized Autofocus lenses for the L mount which perform better than their Aspherical competitors and without any depth of field disadvantage. Of course, they gather less light, but that isn\u2019t often a problem with modern sensors. MTF Curves Whilst the MTF values for the 28 APO are not quite as jaw dropping as those of it's 35mm sibling they are still outstanding, In real terms there is no penalty shooting the 28 APO at f2 and little shooting at 0.5 metre. --img--  Image Quality It\u2019s all very well talking figures (sorry), and I\u2019m always a little wary of proselytising about the \u2018Leica Look\u2019 (it would be easier if I could actually define it). Like the other SL Summicrons I just love the results this lens produces; many of the images in the attached gallery were shot at wide aperture (often at f2) and there seems to be a real glow about them, this isn\u2019t just evident at base ISO where you might expect it, but right up to ISO 6400 and beyond. In common with the other lenses in the range the 28 still shows gorgeous gentle bokeh, both in front and behind the focal plane with a lovely roll-off between in and out of focus areas (nothing edgy). Stop down a little and the lens is very sharp, right to the corners, but still not in any way harsh. There is little or no distortion (although this is probably corrected in software). I saw almost no flare whilst testing the lens (often in tricky backlit situations) and absolutely no Chromatic aberration - even in the most challenging high contrast images. Conclusion Sadly I only had this lovely lens for a short period, a period where taking pictures of people with a wide angle wasn't really possible because of Covid. I'm increasingly impressed with the range of SL Summicron lenses, It's a fantastic endeavour to create a whole set of consistent primes. It makes total sense for the serious photographer to have a set of lenses which are identical ergonomically and have a similar visual character. I've only really used them for still photography, but the recent firmware development of 'fixed throw' manual focus should make them equally popular with videographers - especially on the SL2-S. By abandoning large aperture \"bragging rights\" and making the lenses f2 it has allowed Leica to maximise the image quality across all apertures and right out to the corners. In addition it allows them to make the lenses manageably small and consistent in size and weight.

When I get ready to write a report, the first thing I do is to go through the images taken with the camera / lens and make some basic picks to give me ideas about what to write. In this instance the pictures seemed like a glimpse into another world, the world of Cornish beaches and moorland in summer sunshine (actually, it rains much of the time, but that isn't what the pictures say). A lot of the pictures in the attached gallery were shot wide open, which adds to the dreamlike feeling surrounding them. On the other hand, social distancing was definitely the order of the day, so people pictures are few and far between So here is a short report to celebrate the release of the new APO Summicron SL 28mm f2 Asph The 28mm is the 5th lens in the APO SL Summicron lineup. There will be more wide angle lenses released during the next year or so, while the 35, 50, 75 and 90 have already been released. The Lens As expected, the APO-Summicron-SL 28 f2 Asph is exactly the same form factor as the previous APO Summicrons, (and the future ones as well). The optical design varies between the lenses: in this case it is 13 elements in 10 groups with 3 aspherical lenses and 6 aspherical surfaces. 8 of the elements are made with anomalous partial dispersion glass, which helps to completely remove any colour fringing. The minimum focus distance is 0.24metres, allowing a magnification of 0.2x (as the other SL Summicrons). The lens weighs in at a little over 700gm (without lens hood), not light perhaps, but it balances perfectly on the SL2 (and the SL2-S) and is fine for a full days shooting. Manual Focus is 'focus by wire', but using an innovative system with a magnetic focusing ring, this changes it's polarity when the ring is turned. By default this causes an acceleration if the rotational speed is faster. However, with the SL2 and SL2-s you can now make the focus action linear and decide between focus throws from 90-360 deg in a number of steps. The lens uses the same 'Dual Syncro Drive' motor as the other SL Summicrons and shares their excellent Auto Focus performance (fast enough and very accurate). APO Lenses, Contrast and Depth of Field The almost zero aberrations (especially chromatic aberrations) in the new Summicron SL lenses means a big increase in contrast where the image is in focus. As you move away from the point of perfect focus the contrast drops sharply. This means that the transition between \u2018sharp\u2019 and \u2018bokeh\u2019 is defined more quickly and results in smoother out of focus areas than in conventional lenses. I have a diagram drawn for me by Peter Karbe in my notebook, but here is the graph from the Leica website comparing the APO Summicron SL 75 with the Summilux M 75. --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> The result of this is not just that the 75 APO SL is sharper (it certainly is), but that it has apparently the same DOF as the 75 Summilux-M. The MTF figures for the 50 APO are even better, and so the effect is even more visible. So we have a series of modestly sized Autofocus lenses for the L mount which perform better than their Aspherical competitors and without any depth of field disadvantage. Of course, they gather less light, but that isn\u2019t often a problem with modern sensors. MTF Curves Whilst the MTF values for the 28 APO are not quite as jaw dropping as those of it's 35mm sibling they are still outstanding, In real terms there is no penalty shooting the 28 APO at f2 and little shooting at 0.5 metre. --img--  Image Quality It\u2019s all very well talking figures (sorry), and I\u2019m always a little wary of proselytising about the \u2018Leica Look\u2019 (it would be easier if I could actually define it). Like the other SL Summicrons I just love the results this lens produces; many of the images in the attached gallery were shot at wide aperture (often at f2) and there seems to be a real glow about them, this isn\u2019t just evident at base ISO where you might expect it, but right up to ISO 6400 and beyond. In common with the other lenses in the range the 28 still shows gorgeous gentle bokeh, both in front and behind the focal plane with a lovely roll-off between in and out of focus areas (nothing edgy). Stop down a little and the lens is very sharp, right to the corners, but still not in any way harsh. There is little or no distortion (although this is probably corrected in software). I saw almost no flare whilst testing the lens (often in tricky backlit situations) and absolutely no Chromatic aberration - even in the most challenging high contrast images. Conclusion Sadly I only had this lovely lens for a short period, a period where taking pictures of people with a wide angle wasn't really possible because of Covid. I'm increasingly impressed with the range of SL Summicron lenses, It's a fantastic endeavour to create a whole set of consistent primes. It makes total sense for the serious photographer to have a set of lenses which are identical ergonomically and have a similar visual character. I've only really used them for still photography, but the recent firmware development of 'fixed throw' manual focus should make them equally popular with videographers - especially on the SL2-S. By abandoning large aperture \"bragging rights\" and making the lenses f2 it has allowed Leica to maximise the image quality across all apertures and right out to the corners. In addition it allows them to make the lenses manageably small and consistent in size and weight. The Apochromatic character of the lenses makes the depth of field feel like lenses a stop faster anyway, so you get the best of all possible worlds.

I found the most reliable methods for me to focus were two-fold: focus on point sources (streetlights, city lights, the moon, or worse case scenario, stars). If I needed to focus closer, I would use a high powered headlamp designed for biking at night. I found the S was quite reliable to focus on point light sources (not always with stars, but with closer or larger bright light sources).

Some may say rangefinder focusing is outdated but many of us disagree and think it is brilliant! However, the rangefinder mechanism requires accuracy to work properly and from time to time, requires recallibration. Some people go for years without needing this, and for others, it may be months between service intervals. While third parties tend to do this, as always it is better to send it back to Leica if you can. That means potentially not having the camera for months and having to pay additional costs. To save money, you can research people locally who have a reputation for good CLAs, but it's always at your own risk. If you are puchasing an older used body, at least you don't have to worry about voiding the warranty. There are also some whose rangefinders require calibration but they have adapated and still manage to use them. It would be unfortunate to sink everything you have into a camera which you can't afford to keep in good repair, a concern that I had with moving to Leica and when I started out with some of my watches. Savings you make initially by finding cheap deals can end up costing more in the long-term. This can be due to damage or misalignment (even where care has been taken) or increased peripheral costs such as buying and developing film by saving on later digital models. Have an idea of a good overall focal length prime lens and be prepared to use your imagination (and feet) and develop your skill to make it more versatile for a while. Personally, I think everyone should spend some time with a single lens even if you have a range to choose from. If on a budget, be prepared for your first lens not to be a Leica as well. Other brands are capable of making fantastic glass (Zeiss and Voigtlander in particular). Spend time researching and identifying the things you need and would like to have (they are not the same despite me often convincing myself I need things I don't). Then do a hell of a lot of research. It's a big and expensive decision so this shouldn't be skipped. Watch videos on YouTube (I'm a fan of Matt Osborne among many others) read through forums to work out what you need, and ask questions. We all love talking about Leica photography (which is why we are on here), we all need help or other people's opinions from time to time, and we get a sense of additional value by helping others out. Many of us remember what it was like starting out. Please note however, everyone will appreciate it if you do your research first, and then come to the forum with specific questions or comparisons.

I have to say: I've *never* looked at any of my photos with a goal of obtaining a particular film's look and feel, even the photos made with my film cameras. When my medium was 100% film, I chose what film I wanted to work with based on its colors and response curve (always slide film) and just worked with it to get what my eye wanted ... That's much the same as what I do today with instant print cameras since I only ever use B&W negative film otherwise today. What a given B&W film produces is mostly determined by its color sensitivity response curves, which I map with a Color Checker and my usual developing sludge (*all* my film gets the same soup) and the minor nuances of grain and acutance are things I push on to achieve what my eye wants, which isn't necessarily what the film's look and feel are supposed to be. When I am shooting with digital capture, I usually have in mind what I'm looking for as output and it's never a matter of \"I want it to look like 1970s Tri-X in D76\" or some such malarkey as that. I want expressive tonal scale that fits the subject, color tones if I want a polychrome rendering that suits my ideas, and I'll add or subtract grain to make it look the way my eye wants, even if I don't remember what film and developer looked like that once upon a time. So this notion of striving for a \"film look\" seems to me to be mostly talking in circles about things that do not matter. Strive to make photographs that express what you see/feel about the subject, with whatever capture medium you use. Who cares what film it might have once looked like? It's unimportant. Does the photo connect with your emotions and thoughts that motivated you to make it...? That's what's important. --img--  Leica M4-2 + Pentax SMC-L 43mm Special + Instant Magny 35; Fujifilm Instax SQ :: rendered and then reprocessed through ShakeIt Photo app to achieve the instant print surround.

Leica Crafted a One-of-a-Kind Panoramic S2 for Josef Koudelka So, at least they have thought about a pano camera in some form or fashion. Just for the record, Koudelka's panoramic S2 was a basic S2 with a cropped film gate, and a cropping mask in the viewfinder. Anyone with any S camera can get identical results simply by cropping a narrow horizontal band (i.e. 45mm x 15mm) out of any S image. It did not add any detail or resolution or pixels - it threw away pixels to get the panoramic shape. It did have a one-off monochrom-ized sensor (made without a Bayer color filter layer), which probably microscopically improved resolution of certain textures compared to a desaturated RGB S image. If one prints big enough. However, speaking of the S, it should be noted that, since 2013, Leica now owns Sinar, the Swiss view-camera company. Which even makes a \"view-camera tilt-shift\" front-end unit for the S. https://sinar.swiss/assets/Uploads/Manual-Sinar-p3-MF-L-EN.pdf Assuming there is any economic case to be made for the idea (Leica not being a charity, and this being a niche within a niche within a niche), a combined project with Sinar for a 35mm panoramic film camera would likely be the most sensible route. Sinar provides the basic \"box\" - and a Sinaron lens/shutter with appropriate format coverage (no Leica M lens will cover an image ~72mm wide). Leica (and/or Leica Portugal, or Uwe Weller Feinwerktechik, Leica's other tame machine shop) might well provide the film rails, film wind/rewind, cassette handling, and optical viewfinders. (Of course, Lomo already provides the same - in plastic, for an exorbitant $US 75.00: https://shop.lomography.com/en/cameras/panoramic-cameras/sprocket-rocket ) I suspect the result could be marketed both through Leica and Sinar's organizations - not sure whether it would get a Leica red dot, or a Sinar red dot, though.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/316940-would-leica-ever-make-a-panoramic-35mm-film-camera/?tab=comments#comment-4118861", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "316940-would-leica-ever-make-a-panoramic-35mm-film-camera", "result": false, "Selector": "[idea, makes]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "which even makes a \"view-camera tilt-shift\" front-end unit for the s. https://sinar.swiss/assets/uploads/manual-sinar-p3-mf-l-en.pdf assuming there is any economic case to be made for the idea (leica not being a charity, and this being a niche within a niche within a niche), a combined project with sinar for a 35mm panoramic -----> film !!!  camera would likely be the most sensible route.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 6121, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "MikeMyers", "date": "2021-11-26 21:58:00", "content": "For what it's worth, my second copy of the lens arrived today. This time it took only five minutes to adjust the focusing ramp such that when the lens reads \"infinity\", so does my rangefinder on my M10. I then quickly set it up for photos at ISO 100 at each aperture, 2, 2.8. 4, 5.6, 8, 11, and 16. My biggest issue was center focus at f/2. That has been corrected on this lens - while it looks slightly better as I stop down, even the f/2 image is acceptable - in the center. As I stop down the sides of the image get sharper, and by f/4. and better yet, f/5.6, the results are acceptable (but not like a Leica lens). For my desire to use it on my M8.2, the lens is perfect as-is. I guess I get to start testing/using it for regular images. I know I'm not sending this one back. By the time it reaches f/11, I don't see any issues, even in the corners. I'm in no way any kind of \"professional lens tester\", but I know for my purposes, this lens is a keeper. For use on my M10 in India, where it's dirty and dusty, and I might not want to be walking around with a gazillion dollar Leica lens, this lens is also fine for me. (I'm no longer a working photographer, and even if I was, I'm not able to spend what new Leica gear costs, and luckily, I haven't much of a desire to step \"up\" from my M10.) I still have the problem of getting the same exposure as I expect. As I went through my seven photos, starting at f/2, through f/16, when I close the aperture by one stop, the shutter should also need to be adjusted by one stop. I ignored that, and set the shutter speed until my built-in meter indicated the right setting. This may be a real issue for using the lens on a film Leica - I wonder if the \"click stops\" for each aperture are in the correct location. That's the only thing I can think of that might cause this. Maybe the lens is fine, but the aperture markings on the lens are in the wrong location, along with the \"click stops\". My person advice for anyone buying one of these lenses, buy it, adjust the focus ramp on the lens to match your camera, test it at all apertures, and if it's good enough for you (for a mere $300ish) keep it. If it's not sharp wide open in the center, send it back for a replacement. Others here might be much more qualified than I am (not) to test the lens, and who might offer much better advice. It does come with a focusing target, and that's how 7Artisans wants us to test the lens, but if the rangefinder doesn't indicate \"zero\" at infinity, I would never be satisfied with the lens. ---------- Testing with the M8.2 was much nicer. From f/5.6 on, the images were acceptable. The M8.2 creates different \"color\" images, warmer, and in some ways nicer than the M10, but the M10 has so much more detail. I think this lens was made for my M8.2 camera I have no idea yet how it will work with film, so I'll trust what others here have written. I'll get to try it soon. --img--  Edited November 26 by MikeMyers", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/283856-first-7artisans-35mm-f2-lens-review/page/8/?tab=comments#comment-4320963", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "283856-first-7artisans-35mm-f2-lens-review", "result": false, "Selector": "[idea, made]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "i think this lens was made for my m8.2 camera i have no idea yet how it will work with -----> film !!! , so i'll trust what others here have written.", "sortedWord": "film", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13036, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Slender", "date": "2021-04-07 17:07:00", "content": "An Apple video format that compresses the Raw data from the sensor into an editing friendly Apple ProRes format.

I think you are close with the colour which is difficult if you are inverting just by eye. And scanner software doesn't always do a good job. I just tried pressing 'Auto Color' in Photoshop and you can see in the histogram how the RGB colours clean up instead of spikes at the highlight end. As for tools there are the plugins Negative Lab Pro for Lightroom or Negmaster for Photoshop that do an excellent job of inverting colour negatives.
