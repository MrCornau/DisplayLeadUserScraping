The higher magnification finders give your eye a better view to judge the alignment of the dual rangefinder images. The downside to the higher magnification is that they can't frame the view of wider lenses, forcing you to add accessory viewfinders for framing (or make a WAG as to the edges of the picture). The original M3 only framed for 50mm and longer lenses (0.9 magnification). As more and more photographers began to use a 35mm extensively, Leica added the \"wide-angle\" M2, with a lower-magnification finder that could show a 35mm frame in the camera (0.72 magnification) - but no framelines for 135 lenses, as a hint that long lenses were not its forte. The 1968 M4 collapsed the M2 and M3 into one camera with a .72x finder that included 4 frames - 35, 50, 90, 135. That became the standard for all subsequent M cameras for 40 years (~1959-1999). In 1981, Leica changed the framelines mechanism (but not the magnification) to squeeze in a set of lines for 28mm lenses (also adding lines for the 75mm focal length, but that is not germain to the finder magnification). Personally, I think 28 framelines in a .72x viewfinder originally designed for the 35mm field of view are overoptimistic - they only show about 90% of what will be in the picture, and are hard to see in one glance for some of us, and don't present the quote-perspective-unquote effects a 28 creates, as well as external finders with .50x (or lower) magnfication. But to each his own taste. In the mid-1990's, Leica introduced the .85x higher-mag finder option as an approximate re-creation of the better-focusing M3 finder, and in 2000, with the intro of the 28mm Summicron, they added the .58x option, (again with the 135mm lines deleted as \"not a good idea\") as a better way to view 28mm shots without the need for an external add-on finder. (At the time, there were rumors that Leica was taking the route followed later by Voigtlander, and producing a \"really-wide\" built-in finder that could frame 24 and 21mm views, and up to 50mm - but that was not to be). Anyway - as to your needs. I would say with a 90 that only opens up to f/4, and is used only \"occasionally\" - you probably don't need the .85x finder. Your 15mm requires a separate viewfinder regardless. As a mid-range lens, your 50 will work pretty well with any finder. Which leaves your 28mm as the \"joker\" in the deck. If you use the 28 a lot, I think you will find the finder designed around the 28 framelines (rather than vice-versa) - the 0.58x - to be your best choice.

Thank you for your comment. When I wrote about the \"SL\" cameras I was speaking about a group of reflex cameras that were left out that I unfortunately apparently did not clarify adequately. I will try to do better here: Adam had specifically excluded \"R\" mount cameras entirely when he wrote his original text. He later corrected this in his Post #17 above. What I was referring to was the group of reflex cameras that preceded the introduction of the \"R\" mount lenses & their cameras: The Leicaflex , The Leicaflex SL, The Leicaflex SL MOT, The Leicaflex SL2 & The Leicaflex SL2 MOT. These are the 5. The confusion may have arisen with my use of the shortened term \"SL\" which many people use as a way of indicating the earlier cameras (Not all actually \"SL\") which take a group of cameras which sometimes do not interface correctly with the later series of \"R\" mount lenses. But: All of the film \"M's\", Various Leicaflex models & \"R's\" use the same film so that once out of the camera the rest would be the same. I was using the exclusion of the Leicaflex models from the \"R\" section as an example of how the exclusion of the Leicaflex models was also missed by him.

Best Regards, Michael Hi Michael, First, please be aware that, in spite of being forum member since Nov. 2002, I have very few posts. I am shy to expose my ignorance and growing mental incapacities. I am very cautious about giving offense, in spite of my best intentions. I have had trouble comprehending your posts. I am intensely interested in the viewfinders of M film cameras, the shutter in M film cameras, operating M film cameras successfully and film that goes into M film cameras. Adam's suggested hierarchy fits perfectly with my interests. Everything else in the Leica forum is just something I have to wade through to get to what interests me. I did not even know that Leica's excellent SL cameras were not in the R camera section. It's been decades since I was interested in SLR cameras, film or digital. I do not know if your \"end up making Film Photography more & more tangential & irrelevant to the main thrust of the Forum. Not more inclusive.\" comment is correct or not. In the last 13 years, the Leica Forum became more and more irrelevant to me as it changed to the current organization. This was the website which originally helped me decide to purchase an 90 APO Summicron and an M7. As the Leica Forum defined its \"main thrust\", I was tempted to sell all my Leica equipment and shoot 120 film. Since Doc Henry's thread, I have purchased a used M4-P, a camera which I have come to love using, unlike the new M6 I purchased in 1985 which was always \"within Leica tolerances\" but never became something I could rely on with 100% confidence. I have also kept the M7, and learned to work with it with affection, not hostility. I have shot four times as much film since I started viewing Doc's thread last January than I used to shoot in a year. To me, Charlie Watts' response to Mick Jagger's original provocative assertion \"You're MY drummer!\" is humorous. I hope you will think so too. Charlie Watts replied \"I ain't YOUR drummer, you're MY singer!\" I'm confident Adam's suggested hierarchy will make it easier for people interested in film images from Leica M equipment to consider the Leica Forum a resource for them. I have read that some people start out with digital equipment and become curious about using Leica film equipment.
