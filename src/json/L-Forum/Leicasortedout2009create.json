I've got to think this thing through a bit more, before I can get my mind to understand it, but if I'm placing this IR filter in front of the lens,a lot of the cells in the image sensor are no longer collecting any data.

To footnoteblog, I shot these in 'jpg'; can I still create a \"custom DNG profile\"? I'm still just learning Lightroom. This sounds like another alternative, instead of what Ken Rockwell suggests which is done in Photoshop. About the filter, what is the reason to use a 092 or 093 filter instead of what I'm now using? Actually, I don't even know what it is I'm now using. I think I probably bought it for an \"infrared filter\" 35 years ago, but who knows what I got.

Thank you for the feedback and I've tried to take in your comments with an open mind. But is my thinking flawed that I should expect the focus be within the DoF even at f/1.1 after testing it on a tripod to mitigate any sort of unsteadiness on my part? And even when stopped down to f/4, the focus is off. I've also noticed that the further away the subject is, the more it back focuses. I had sent DAG an email and I am told that he can not adjust it because of it's design. I've not yet heard back from Stephan Gandy.
