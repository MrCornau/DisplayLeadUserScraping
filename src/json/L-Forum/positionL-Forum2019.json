Given all of your expertise on lecias, I\u2019m curious if you think the M10-d (as in its image quality and Color rendition) is a lot better than the m-d. I\u2019m asking this because I\u2019m considering whether it is better to purchase the M10-d instead of the m-d even though it\u2019s pricier. From the little that I do know, the M10-d (or M10 for that matter) - due to it having a different maestro (I) processor as opposed to the maestro I - might have more accurate Color rendition? As for the sensor, I believe the are both using the same Cmos one with minor difference in pixel count? I also know that the M10-d\u2019s iso is a lot better and the viewfinder is larger and clearer too but I think I can do without those for a lower cost. Thank you in advance! I was in the exact same position as you months ago. Just a reminder, that you need to consider other differences between M-D and M10-D besides IQ. For example, due to the lack of menu system (M10-D has menu system, which is in the Fotos app), you can not set up lens information, which means uncoded lenses can not be recognized, which means, the in-camera processing is disabled for those lenses, which may be a big deal for wide-angled (equal or wider than 35mm) lenses. Also, M-D can only output NEF raw file but M10-D can output JPG. And M10-D can be attached with EVF for critical focusing. However, with the help of wi-fi SD card, you can still transfer images from M-D to your mobile device, however, how to view/edit the raw files can be an issue... If you can deal with these differences, then why not save those money to buy a good Leica lens?\ud83d\ude00", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/262069-i-love-my-m-d-262/page/5/?tab=comments#comment-3711616", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "17 hours ago, et7 said: hi thorsten and everyone, thank you for sharing these info. given all of your expertise on lecias, i\u2019m curious if you think the m10-d (as in its image quality and color rendition) is a lot better than the m-d. i\u2019m asking this because i\u2019m considering whether it is better to purchase the m10-d instead of the m-d even though it\u2019s pricier. from the little that i do know, the m10-d (or m10 for that matter) - due to it having a different maestro (i) processor as opposed to the maestro i - might have more accurate color rendition? as for the sensor, i believe the are both using the same cmos one with minor difference in pixel count? i also know that the m10-d\u2019s iso is a lot better and the viewfinder is larger and clearer too but i think i can do without those for a lower cost. thank you in advance! i was in the exact same -----> position !!!  as you months ago. just a reminder, that you need to consider other differences between m-d and m10-d besides iq. for example, due to the lack of menu system (m10-d has menu system, which is in the fotos app), you can not set up lens information, which means uncoded lenses can not be recognized, which means, the in-camera processing is disabled for those lenses, which may be a big deal for wide-angled (equal or wider than 35mm) lenses. also, m-d can only output nef raw file but m10-d can output jpg. and m10-d can be attached with evf for critical focusing. however, with the help of wi-fi sd card, you can still transfer images from m-d to your mobile device, however, how to view/edit the raw files can be an issue... if you can deal with these differences, then why not save those money to buy a good leica lens?\ud83d\ude00", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 14605, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 357190, "autor": "nilca", "date": 1574910720000, "content": "1 hour ago, MrQ said: Would you know if the multifunction grip version 14496 works with the M-E typ 240?

My opinion here will be one from the eyes and thoughts of a fairly new Leica shooter, but not a novice photographer. I've resisted posting a response because my initial reaction was not a real positive one. While I think the question may have been posted with the best of intentions, to me it simply reeks of the elitism often associated with Leica. I'm going to apologize right here and now for what I suspect could come across as somewhat aggressive and possibly mean. This is not meant to be a personal attack. We need more encouragement and collaboration in this world don't we? Why does there have to be an assumed level of knowledge? Did the great masters through the decades start with something else to hone their craft? (maybe?) In another response it was suggested that one might not \"get the most out of\" the gear without some knowledge. I actually find it a bit refreshing that a complete novice shooter would desire to buy this very basically equipped gear to learn on. Why shouldn't they learn via the basic, core essentials of what photography is? Learn the craft and not rely on the computer between your eye and the world to make decisions for you. That approach is SO easy to do in this world of instant gratification and life at 144 characters. The first person mentioned; See my previous comment. Once again, why does it matter and why should there be any qualification gate? This will touch on a far different subject but some people will simply buy what they perceive to be \"the best\". They want to be part of the elite. The special. The cool-kids. Etc. Leica has a well deserved reputation for being among the best in the world. The legacy, the storied photographers who use the gear and timeless results all lead to that place of indeed being something special. But again, who cares? Sure, that gear may never be used but does it matter? Let them purchase all they want and celebrate it. If Leica sales slip away what will be left? For the second person; Again, what does it matter? Why assume they aren't using the gear because it\u2019s a big lens? Maybe there is a problem with the camera. Maybe the battery is dead. Maybe they didn't see anything that excited them enough to create an image. Maybe they fell and hurt their shoulder and it's physically painful to even lift it. I offer those examples of things I have experienced personally. I can also tell you I've walked around an entire day, or dayS even without shooting a single frame. I've done it with small gear, and I've done it with large pro-body Canon gear and big lenses. I apologize for what some might call a rant, but let's offer a position of openness and community rather than one of elitism and you-aren't-good-enough or skilled enough attitudes. We are all constantly learning (or should be) and we should welcome any and all who want to come along for the ride. Be it with the Rolleiflex twin-lens, the 110 instamatic, the latest Sony/Canon/Nikon/Fuji or the much desired Leica it should not matter one bit. Let's support and encourage the arts. And maybe, just maybe we can reduce the elitism perception while still maintaining the desire and mystic of the amazing Leica solutions. I jumped in and find it to be incredibly refreshing, and desires for more still exist but are much more easily satiated by knowing I don't really need it. (but bring on the M10 and 'll take it ) Everyone who has asked me about the M has been encouraged to get one for the simplicity as I hand it to them to feel the substance. I cannot stress enough how this is not meant to be a personal attack or criticism but one simply using your points as originally posted. Maybe, just maybe I've provided a viewpoint for thought...or one for laughter and scorn. Thanks for reading this far.

I don't completely agree about composition being limited by the camera one is using. I worked for a couple of years with the X-Pan and there were numerous times I ended up chopping off the sides of images to get rid of unwanted details. In my opinion, and in my practice, cropping is initially done in my head, not the camera.

Have you done your search before posting? It was covered many times. In 2015 Leica was using same \"corrosive\" sensors as replacement. My M-E was made in 2015, it \"corroded\" in 2017.

I agree with repair person what Leica Camera AG needs some multi-millions dollars lesson to learn how to run customer service. But it is not going to happen. Leica is niche product. No any other camera makers have boutique stores. Repair person brought auto industry as example. But forgot what apples aren't oranges. If something goes wrong with Chevyota then class action might happen. It is mass products. Yet, I'm not aware of class actions against Audi which makes crappy engines for decades now. Why?

Why no pits is a mystery but even more so, why no receesed part/ring surrounding the lens mount. Either one would have been helpful and with their having such with their 35mm f2, I don't see why this changed.

There is a long post on it in the M FAQ. A book to read (old, but not obsolete ) is Fraser and Schewe: Real World Image Sharpening. That is just one method, there are a host of others. I have settled on capture sharpening in ACR, creative sharpening by the sharpening brush, and output sharpening by a number of ways, either on a layer and high-pass filter, using one of the Topaz plugins, Focus Magic plugin, or the Photoshop options. It all depends on the subject matter and subject frequency, the type of blur I want to sharpen, residual image noise and whether it is for print -and print size- or web.

Regards, Paul As a thought experiment, the sprocket would always need to rotate X amount since it must pull the film eight perforations worth for every frame. This might be exactly one full rotation if the diameter of the sprocket is sized to do so but it is not necessary. It just needs to advance the film the same amount each time. The sprocket could be connected to a further interior gear or cam that does the actual \"measuring\" of the film's linear advance. The take-up spool does not need to do that. In fact it cannot since the effective diameter of the take-up spool changes as one wraps more film around it. Since each additional rotation of the spool has a different, increasing, circumference I don't see how it could be used to \"measure\" film advance with any consistency. One of them is clutched? In my Nikon Fs I would insert the tongue into the spool and advance the spool with my thumb to ensure it was secure and then draw the cassette across the gate to its nest on the left, with the rewind crank. That the take-up spool was clutched was easy to feel when doing this. Leica's shutter might not be so different since I believe Nikon copied Leica for the shutter in the S. I think my M-A has variable spacings. It certainly has narrower spacings than my M3. I don't care since it's not going into transparency mounts at the Kodak K-14 lab. Good luck figuring this out!

(In this example I used a closer distance so the indicator marks I made would be easier to see.) Then use a sharp (0.5mm) pencil to mark on the lens distance scale where the RF shows it is in focus: --img--  Then, without moving the camera or target, switch to Live View and use magnified focus to get the sharpest focus on the same target point. This will likely be a bit different than the RF if the lens hasn't been adjusted yet. Mark this point on the lens also: --img--  The distance between the two marks is the amount the focus cam needs to move so that the RF indicated focus matches the true image focus. In this case, the lens cam needs to move clockwise so the RF will focus at the same point as the image. To adjust, the lens helical must stay fixed while you move the focus cam, so it is easiest to do with the lens against the infinity stop. Remove the lens, set it to the stop, and mark the cam where it aligns with the edge of the bayonet tab. Then make another mark the same distance apart as the marks made on the distance scale, and in the same direction - so here the second mark is left of the mark at the stop: --img--  Now slightly loosen the two screws that lock the focus cam in place: --img--  Then, holding the helical against the infinity stop, rotate the focus cam until the \"RF\" mark aligns with the edge of the bayonet tab: --img--  Snug up the two screws with the cam in this position and verify that it is aligned when the focus is at the infinity stop. Then re-check the difference between the RF and Live View focus, and repeat if necessary. This should adjust for all distances IF the focus cam on the lens is accurately ground.

Hi, this is my first post here. I am struggling with focus adjustment. I thought, I could adapt the lens on a mirrorless camera (Fujifilm X-T2) and use 7artisans adjustment tips. But when I rotate the focus cam nothing seems to happen, focus is still shifted. I rotated the focus cam clockwise until it can't be rotated any more. Does this only work with a digital M?

First, there aren\u2019t all that many people in a position to compare the two cameras in question. Second, it\u2019s not at all clear what you mean by \u201csharper\u201d. At what viewing distance? With what screen size? With sharpening optimized for that particular screen resolution and viewing distance? What lens? With the S1R down-samples to the same pixel count as the S1 or left at native resolution? In general, I\u2019d be shocked if whatever smoothing is applied to the S1R were so aggressive as to completely remove the additional contrast available with the higher pixel count. That would just be silly. But once you get above 20 megapixels or so it becomes really challenging to actually capture all the resolution a camera is truly capable of. For example, my SL with the 35mm Summicron SL lens shot at f/2 will routinely out-resolve my Hasselblad X1D II with a 45mm XCD lens at f/3.2 when shot at close focus. But that\u2019s at close focus. And it still doesn\u2019t have the dynamic range of the X1D. Still, that lens (among the best Leica makes for 135 format) can, at close focus, more than make up for what the SL gives up in megapixels. What lens would you use for your comparison? What aperture? Diffraction will become the dominant factor in resolution at a lower f-stop on the S1R than on the S1. Would you be comparing at f/8? F/5.6? F/2? Personally, I am quite happy with 24 megapixels for everything I do as long as I don\u2019t have to crop much. The main advantage I see in the higher pixel count of the S1R (or my Q2, for that matter, which likely has the same sensor) is additional flexibility in cropping. Even with the Hasselblad, I enjoy the camera\u2019s output more because of the dynamic range improvements and because the camera manages to hold color saturation in very fine detail much better than the SL rather than because of any additional resolution.

Most of these images had been acquired with an ISO of between 200 and 800 and only those that employed a circular polarizer were taken with an ISO close to the 1600 range.

This issue the EVF issues, bad on/off switch on QP, floating focus on CL, very slow repairs, etc, I would thing at these prices you could at least expect very fast repairs but, maybe Leica is to focused on watches these days?? Thank you so much for your kind words Jaclo. Well some times I just think that all these are just first world problems! But then they can get pretty annoying Here is a video demonstrating the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d99Ag6_1Xho&feature=youtu.be In this video from 00:00 - 00:20 you can see how the button works when in the \u201cbad\u201d placement. I focus on the keyboard by half pressing it, I turn the camera with the button half pressed on my laptop screen and then I press fully the button. At that point the camera should instantly take a shot of the blurry screen. Instead of that it tries again to focus on the screen and some times it doesn\u2019t even take a photo when it can\u2019t focus. Then from 00:20 - 00:42 I rotate the button to the \u201cgood\u201d placement (you can see the marks on the shutter button that I added after lots of try and error in order to be able to identify it easily). Now it works as expected.

Hello Paul, Other cameras might be more convenient for closeups than a Nikonos but in & out of the water, including 1/2 in & 1/2 out, at the same regular distances that you would use any other 35mm lens out of the water on a nice day, or in a snowstorm, or in a muddy or/& a dusty place, or in a rainstorm: A Nikonos is easy to use & very convenient. By the way, A 1968 Nikkor 35mm, F2.5 lens, which is coated, produces images on par with a 35mm, F2 Summicron, Version I (Also a design from the 1950's.) when used at medium apertures. It is essentially the same Double Gauss optical formula as a 35mm, F2.8 Summaron produced at the same time period.

I think it's a wonderful piece of kit. Like many here, I have other Leica kit to choose from, but I think for travel the VLux is hard to beat. I wandered around London in the heat last week with my SL and 24-90. And I was knackered at the end of it. Now, I'm sure the results might have been better than the VLux (in hands other than mine anyhow), but in my amateur hands I think the VLux would have done as good a job in reality. And although one could not call the VLux cheap, I'd sooner drop or lose it than I would any of my M kit or the SL! Regards John Thank you John. A wise choice. The excellent pictures shown in this thread demonstrate how versatile the camera can be with some highly impressive close-ups. Much depends on the expected destiny of our individual photography. Certainly for amateur (that is non-professional) photography, the V-Lux is more than capable of returning extremely good results. I bought mine mainly to help me identify birds in the garden, particularly migrants who often spend no more than an hour or so per year while in transit. But I have been inspired by the excellent results you and others attain on a regular basis. The V-Lux is a little on the bulky side, but saves significantly on weight; is well-made and highly capable in some challenging situations. Only today, in pouring rain I noticed a bird on the lawn apparently in distress. I grabbed the V-Lux and shot through heavily rain-impaired double-glazed windows only to discover that a pigeon seemed to be having a shower in yoga positions. The picture is of low quality and not in this league to be shown. But it served my purpose of solving a mystery in nature without even leaving the house..

Adobe Lightroom 6.14 doesn't recognise raw files - have to pay Adobe subscription now Aperture dial wobbles slightly. I would prefer stiff and tight In conclusion a terrific camera. Yes not the quality of my A7Rii or M240 but in good light its 90% there and no one will notice, and in low light its 60% there and good enough for whole pictures if not at the pixel level. Some improvements in next version to controls and EVF and its pretty much as good as it gets for a pocket zoom. On the subject of ISO my other camera is an M7. Used to ISO 400 max and the noise it generates, I can honestly say that this pocket zoom camera eclipses film by some. Not an important criteria to many but when you train yourself to use wide open and max ISO 400 its a real breeze to use this thing (after many years of protest I now almost exclusively use Auto-ISO). Other rivals for pocket ? Not much really. Main one is RX100VA. A great camera but because of size more suitable for point and shoot, D-Lux 7 puts the fun and manual control on tap. All the other options, like 5100, GX9, Pen-F, X-E3, add significant size and bulk even if pancake prime used Good enough for main camera ? sure. Significantly better then latest phone cameras ? surprisingly not that much for close product photos or kids videos - not many flies on my XR. But for optical zoom, DOF control (yes, surprisingly a large amount to play with), sharpness and distance and creative control, still no comparison. Finally I still like the design more over the Panasonic, which is why I bought it really.
