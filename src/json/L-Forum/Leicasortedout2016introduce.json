ETTR is an interesting concept but ..... The problem is that once you have a contrast range which the sensor cannot accommodate you have to decide how your exposure should best be made - i.e. at what level are you prepared to have your highlights burn out. And the reason ETTR doesn't always work is because its another metering method which you can use IF its appropriate and of course it isn't always appropriate and it has to be used intelligently too. The basic problem we have is that increasing ISO is simply turning up the amplification and of course noise is boosted too. I've assumed that so far camera manufacturers have tuned their in-camera software to adjust for increased ISO so that the resulting files are optimised. But post processing software has become so good that this really isn't required anymore IMO anyway. And things will no doubt evolve further. I've come from a film background but it has always struck me that 'digital sensitivity' described in terms of ISO (and digital ISO has a technical definition) was always an odd way of doing things and rather backward looking. Backward because digital sensors do not have characteristic curves like film - and are interpreted in a different way. So using ISO as sensitivity cannot be the best solution. I would like to see RAW files 'tagged' with an optimum ISO at which they should be interpreted by software rather than embedded with it so that it cannot be undone, which appears to be the case at present. A different way of looking at things and one which won't appeal to everyone, but there you go. And FWIW I DO shoot at base ISO all the time and rely of software to adjust - its not theory, its how I use my Leicas and it can work effectively, but its a slower way of operating relevant only if it suits your RAW workflow.

Philip: The improvements over Vuescan as I see them: - Silverfast seems to produce a flatter linear scan that doesn't clip at either end. Even when opened in Colorperfect it's very flat and boring - which is exactly what I want. Vuescan seems to me to introduce a curve even to the supposed flat linear scans; - Silverfast is much faster. I gave up doing multi-exposure with Vuescan long ago, both because it became INTOLERABLY slow on the 9000, but also I was afraid of the wear that might be involved on the machine: the scanner always seemed to be laboring so much more. Multiexposure in Silverfast seems to take about as long as single scan on Vuescan. Haven't strictly timed these impressions yet; - the scans have the TINIEST bit more visible detail. This is things like a tiny amount of fabric detail in a woven dress - barely visible only at 100%. When I look at the entire image on-screen, I feel like the added texture maybe helps the image. This is almost certainly my imagination. When I have time over the weekend I will try to post some comparison crops. You will need your spectacles to see the difference. The downsides: - I haven't been able to do a successful batch scan so far. With persistence I think I might get there sometime over the next few weeks; - all of the reasons I stated in the posts above - plus doubtless more rants to come; If I needed to buy the software separately for two scanners (almost \u20ac700!!!!) I would almost definitely NOT do it, no matter how many times Vuescan froze on me. Not so much the amount, but the principle would bug me far too much for a marginal improvement. The scariest thing is that the company has charged users the full price for upgrades - somewhere (typically I don't recall where) I read one user ranting about how they'd been forced to pay multiple full-price upgrades when Lasersoft finally managed to build a 64bit version of the app for modern OSes (several years after the competition). So even if you budget for a one-off expense, it may come back to bite you very hard in the future. PS: Just an aside - there's been occasional talk about financial trouble at the company - though all just rumor as I understand it. Considering the Quark-like nature of their business this wouldn't surprise me though. So maybe the whole edifice may collapse any time. That wouldn't necessarily be a concern if it weren't for the insistent way their software 'phones home'. I'd be concerned that when the servers are no longer there to answer, the software will be 'bricked'.

I\u2019ve only just found this thread, in which I should have introduced myself some time ago - it's probably rather redundant to do so now, after I've made quite a few posts, but here goes anyway...... I am a musician (mainly in the opera world) and live in south London. I bought my first Leica, an M9P, just over two years ago, and it has transformed the pleasure I get from photography. I had my first camera, an Instamatic (remember Flash Cubes?!), when I was about ten, and my first 'proper' camera, a Contax 139 with a couple of Zeiss lenses, twenty years later after borrowing a friend's Pentax SLR and getting hooked. I used mainly Kodachrome and Fujichrome in it; it went all over the world with me and was a complete joy - some of my photos from then are still some of my favourites. In the 90s I was seduced by the convenience of digital and my picture-taking declined into snapping with a succession of Canon pocket cameras. Then one day about four years ago I picked up the old Contax again and realised what I had been missing; I very quickly acquired a used 5D2 and some nice L glass and had quite a lot of fun with it. Inevitably though, its weight and size meant that more often than not it was left at home, and I never did bond with the hi-tech electronic side of it. Aargh! - no aperture ring!! By chance I started reading about Leica, of which I had barely heard, and I became fascinated, almost obsessed, and read everything I could find. Eventually the inevitable happened, and I found a lovely used silver M9P at Richard Caplan at a price I could just about manage, though I could hardly believe that I was letting myself go through with it. Six months later I offloaded the Canon gear as I had barely touched it since the Leica arrived (though I did miss the splendid, if brutal, Canon 85mm 1.2 lens, which I later managed to replace with a 75 Summilux - even better!) I did try a 240 for a few weeks, when my M9 sensor got the dreaded lurgy, but thankfully went back to another M9P. It has taught me more in two years than I have learnt from other cameras over decades, because it addresses the basics so simply and because my fingers constantly itch to pick it up and use it. I am also learning so much from this forum and from you all who are so generous with your knowledge, artistry and encouragement, and usually very courteously. Thank you!
