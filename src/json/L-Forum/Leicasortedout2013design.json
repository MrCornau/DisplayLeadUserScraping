It could be a very small light leak - try taking a picture with the lens cap on and see if those bands appear. Thanks for your ideas! Unfortunately I have ruled nearly all of them out already: - the lines appear in both Aperture & ACR - they are nearly invisible before any PP, but my b&ws are quite conservative so it shouldn't be a problem, and most certainly it hasn't been a problem before. - this happens with at least with my 21mm Elmarit as well as 50mm Zeiss, not sure about the 35. - the lines seem to affect bright (and possibly blue?) areas (sky), so I doubt the lens cap test will reveal anything, but will give it a go. And before anyone asks other usual but irrelevant things: - no, it's not the memory card - no, it's not the battery either. Oh well, it's a fantastic day, I'll try to go hunt some photos and see what turns up in those.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/160294-still-loving-the-m8/page/12/?tab=comments#comment-2273905", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "160294-still-loving-the-m8", "result": true, "Selector": "designed", "selectorShort": "design", "MarkedSent": "-----> designed !!! , a few thoughts: do you shoot raw and then convert? if so, did you try different converters? it could be jpeg artifacts. can you see the lines before doing any post-processing? how much do you push sliders such as exposure, contrast, clarity? aggressive post-processing could be an obvious culprit. does it happen will all your lenses? it could be a reflection from a particular lens. did the camera take a hit? it could be a very small light leak - try taking a picture with the lens cap on and see if those bands appear. thanks for your ideas! unfortunately i have ruled nearly all of them out already: - the lines appear in both aperture & acr - they are nearly invisible before any pp, but my b&ws are quite conservative so it shouldn't be a problem, and most certainly it hasn't been a problem before. - this happens with at least with my 21mm elmarit as well as 50mm zeiss, not sure about the 35. - the lines seem to affect bright (and possibly blue?) areas (sky), so i doubt the lens cap test will reveal anything, but will give it a go. and before anyone asks other usual but irrelevant things: - no, it's not the memory card - no, it's not the battery either. oh well, it's a fantastic day, i'll try to go hunt some photos and see what turns up in those.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 42863, "year": "2013"}, {"autor": "Leica Blog", "date": "2013-10-09 11:00:00", "content": " A unique Leica M, designed by Apple-designer Jony Ive and Marc Newson, will join in the (RED) Auction on November 23rd 2013.
