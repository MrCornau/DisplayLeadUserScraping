This seems to me to notice this even now in the digital photos taken with sensors with more mega. The problem, which also existed with the slides when they had to be printed, is that we have a long bar which must then end up in a small box, so the bar has to be compressed or cut. This comes from from a dynamic range greater than its destination. The real scene has a very wide range, the sensor that collects it much smaller, the monitor a little more and finally the print the smaller. This also seems to me the reason why the 10R files look flatter as soon as they come out and need to be \u201ccompressed\u201d more to get a good contrast. What I ask myself is whether, thinking mainly of the \"box\" inside which the image must end, a certain amount of megapixels is more harmonious and suitable for entering more easily. What do you think ? (This reasoning only on aesthetics and not on the other advantages with more mega) BASIC FILE QUALITY OR DIGITAL ADJUSTMENTS AS CAMEA PURCHASE GUIDES Methinks\u2026 that it is a valid approach, and the one I have taken with my first three digital cameras, M8.2, M9, M9M\u2026 that I buy the body for the character of the sensor-&-color-science-&-rendition and thus for the quality of the file it puts out. With a film camera you pick the body. With digital camera you pick the sensor-&-color-science-&-overall-rendition. After that... I think that built into the digital concept is the idea that a digital file can always be modified infinitely and thus taken from ANY one state to ANY other state. But in practice it has turned out quite differently. The bundle of dots are so damn complex that once set in place moving them through more-or-less fixed routines can create something new but not necessary anything you want to look at. Simple adjustments can of course be made but finally one must admit that starting at A and going to B to C is possible but going to D, E, F, etc. may not be possible or result in anything wants to display. In my experience adding a lot of major changes to the file makes it look like a cartoon. Way back in college (school) I took an electronic music course that told us that by combining multiple sine waves ANY sound could be produced, they called this sound producing equipment a \"synthesizer\". Well if you went through that era of music of the 1960's and 70' you know that, mostly electronic sounds were just a few weird sounds, they only had a few special places in music\u2026 this \"do anything\" technology just resulted in mostly output meant for the trash heap. As good as post production software is, the original file is still the basis for the excellence eventually achieved. As effects are added on, the picture begins to be more synthetic looking, and this adjusted-synthetic-realism aesthetic is the new approach in camera created art. I will be picking bodies for their original file making abilities and not expecting to fix-it-in-post. I will pick the body like I would pick film, for the basic beauty of its file presentation. I will not trick myself into thinking that all can be fixed, changed, solved, or made more perfect in post production software. Due to user comments and internet pictures, it is evident that the Leica M10 is a landmark camera worth buying and saving as part of the history of digital cameras for the rendition of its sensor-color-science module that maintains a sort of perfect balance between realistic-detail and an atmospheric-lack-of-detail also known as \"art\". The Leica M10-R is a proof that going up in resolution creates a new ultra-detail look that is an aesthetic all its own, in some cases called by painters \"still life\" (see my other post). I hope to own both bodies someday\u2026 the M10 for atmospheric artsy look and the M10-R for the super realistic still life's that I also love. These are opposite aesthetics. I wish they could be both pulled from one camera through a menu option and probably they will be someday. Could the M10-R get a firmware update to add the old M10 aesthetic to it? If so it would help justify its tremendous cost. Someone may have achieved these through post production efforts, but if so, I do not have their weblink! Erwin Putts commented the same about a certain 90mm aspherical lens making the picture so sharp that the skin in portraits was too intimate and lacked the beauty created by lessor resolving lenses. This is the downside of high resolution which I hope can be fixed in post. You either like this super detail or you don't. It is a bit polarizing. If you paid $8k USD for the body then you say you like it, if you haven't bought the camera yet then you can have any opinion you want. Me I want both. The next iteration of high resolution camera will probably be even better for the still life super detail aesthetic so I will wait and see what Leica comes up with. Steve has shown that raising pixel count on a file gives clearer focus but of course no new detail so a truly higher resolution sensor is needed to raise the bar.

This seems to imply that is true: https://photorumors.com/2016/01/14/new-leica-summicron-m-35mm-f2-asph-summicron-m-28mm-f2-asph-and-elmarit-m-28mm-f2-8-asph-lenses/ And has anyone compared the 'New\" and \"Original\" 28 Elmarit ASPHs on an M9 with the original, corrodable sensor - or on the revised sensor? And does Leica distinguish between the new and old lenses, either as to catalog number, or as to 6-bit code (which controls green-corner removal)? I'm just wondering if, in having two optical versions of a lens, two versions of a sensor (M9 CCD i and ii), and two versions of the camera firmware (which includes the in-camera color-vignetting profiles) - ALL OR ANY OF WHICH could change the amount of green vignetting produced - something got lost in translation. It may just be a question of - using a 2-generation-old M9, use the older-generation lens. For the record, I've been trying out a v.1 28 Elmarit ASPH on an M10 (yet another, different sensor and firmware, obviously). No significant green corners. Hi, I have the original Elmarit 28mm Asph. My original M-E (corroded) sensor use to work fine with this lens, no green color cast in the corners. Sensor changed back in 2017, from there I've started seeing exact same issue as described. Actually some pics from my camera can be seen in the older post on the subject. I never got feedback from Leica and I've assumed Leica will not come up with a new corrected lens profile, i lost hope in a solution for M9/M-E. Btw, the 21mm profile is different but not much better, i tried all. B&W works fine though.

I have recently bought Canon's own inks because I was very dissatisfied with the results with the inks from 123inkt.nl. They are generally fine for non-critical results, but there is a bit of solarisation on the prints plus the colours are not as accurate as the Canon inks. I did consider inks from Precision Color (https://precisioncolors.com/Pro1000.html) but they are quite frank in saying that they have not been able to reproduce the blue, yellow and red inks and the chroma optimiser. As tempting as it may feel to get a lot more ink for a lot less, for me (I hasten to add), it is not worth it in the long run. So over the last several weeks I've been doing my best to empty the printer by printing and printing and printing and printing. I say that because even though the printer says that the inks are empty, and has said so for a long while, they are not. It has to do, I believe, with the fact that the printer uses internal tanks into which the ink is pushed from the cartridges and this reserve will also need to be emptied. Once the printer is as empty as it can be I will install the Canon inks.

Mine was a Blurb project and, on the whole, it is an impressive-looking volume; circa 120 pages, 13\" x 11\" hard-back with dust-jacket and printed with all the top options available selected. There are, however, two very distinct and very noticeable, fatal flaws. The first is that despite 95% of the photographs (one per page) being rendered as pure monochrome files (the others were duotone / tri-tone / quad-tone) the 4-colour process used for the book has resulted in a gently and randomly variegated tri-tone effect where ALL black and white images are seen, in different areas, in different - quite subtle - tints and tones of magenta, cyan and black. The effect isn't wholly unpleasant - in some cases it adds a....well; shall we say different?...character to the image as originally imagined. NOT what was asked nor expected, though, and I'd rather my b'n'w images were printed B'n'W thank you very much. The second is altogether more weird and far harder to describe but I'll give it a go; on certain areas of a number of images there is a shadow - a 'ghost' - of another image sort-of superimposed on the first. Think about it like this; You are in a darkroom making a traditional wet-print. You expose your sheet of paper in a printing-frame at the base of an enlarger normally with the image captured in negative #1. Then, before you develop the paper, you put the exposed in another printing-frame at another enlarger and give it perhaps 2% exposure-time with image/negative #2. You then dev/stop/fix/wash/dry print and find the very slight double-exposure from the second neg all-but-invisible but, at the same time, THERE all the same. I've been trying to work out how this situation could possibly arise. All I can come up with off the top of my head is that somehow there is a situation arising where a printed page stacked on top of another printed page under a strong light-source is acting as a 'negative' and the paper directly underneath is behaving in some weird sort-of 'printing-out-paper' manner. Just to be absolutely clear; the 'ghost' image is never reversed so there isn't any issue with possible face-to-face (paper) ink print-off situation happening. The 'ghost' image is always seen as a negative in that light is dark and dark is light. The two images concerned are almost always either next to each other in the page-numbering sequence or, at most, one more page apart. HAVING SAID ALL THAT; the book itself is quite impressive and the feeling is of a high-quality product. I will be having further copies printed once my collating / layout / text ideas have been finalised but before entrusting the project to Blurb I will be sending them such feedback as mentioned here and, depending on what they say, either go with them or else take it somewhere else. In the meantime I will wait to see whether anyone else has a suggestion as to who might be a better option in the first place. Philip.

I have a monitor that has a hardware setting for sRGB and I find this very accurate. I don't change the setting when the room lighting changes. But the monitor is unusual as it is a flat CRT, originally supplied with a high-end unix workstation. The iMac screen has a calibration tool in \"settings\" and to view images I set brightness for 100% but if I did not have the CRT monitor I would likely look into profiling the screen with a hardware dongle. I would not adjust the monitor according the image I am viewing as the monitor is the reference. I can't really comment on settings in the current version of Lightroom as I only have the \"perpetual license\" version which is quite good for cataloguing and searching for images but for raw processing I much prefer Capture One. As mentioned elsewhere, it can be useful to do \"Auto Adjust\" (\"auto-tone\" in LR) to see what the software comes up with and this might give a starting point, otherwise reset to original and work from there. A quick web search reveals a number of sites where the C1 workflow is described (often in contrast with LR) so there is more than one way to approach it. \"Less is more\" is a very useful rule of thumb. Viewing the result of adjustments on a well-calibrated monitor while paying close attention to the histogram is essential. Unless you are looking for a special effect, the aim is for the histogram to extend across the full range from black to white with a solid middle (where much of the detail is found). C1 does not distinguish between \"library\" and develop, using tabs to choose each option. LR obviously needs to be in \"develop\" mode to do processing other than the \"quick develop\" in library mode. As I said in the original post, the most important thing is to come up with a workflow that is consistent, reliable and repeatable. Many tools interact with each other so getting them into the right order is also important. My workflow in C1 goes like this (work through the same sequence each time): - Styles and Presets (the develop menu in LR has something similar) if there is something you prepared earlier - Lens module - Color module - Exposure module (this is the module where the most dramatic adjustments are made and care needs to be take not to \"over do\" it) -- start with \"exposure\" to get a good histogram -- I find \"highlight\", \"shadow\", \"white\" and \"black\" much more useful than \"brightness\" and \"contrast\" C1 has a \"details\" module where sharpening, noise reduction film grain, spot removal are found, not sure about the LR equivalents -- sharpening and noise reduction best left at zero unless there is something about the original raw file (eg exposed at high ISO) that needs work -- modern cameras with little or no anti-aliasing filters on the sensor don't need sharpening in my experience and film scans can become very grainy if sharpening (as opposed to clarity) is over-used -- spot removal can be very useful if there was dust on the sensor or spots on a film scan -- \"clarity\" in my experience works much better than \"sharpening\" - Output (in C1) - LR uses \"export\" This is the place to decide whether to produce a TIFF file (e.g. for use in another program such as Photoshop or DxO Nik Collection) or a JPEG (for web, e-mail etc). - Print -- the most important thing here is to have good color management as \"managed by printer\" is rarely sufficient hence a bespoke profile for your combination of printer, paper, ink", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/313699-how-professionals-avoid-over-do-on-editing/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4054699", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "313699-how-professionals-avoid-over-do-on-editing", "result": true, "Selector": "comes up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "the monitor is the trickiest one to get right in my experience. i have a monitor that has a hardware setting for srgb and i find this very accurate. i don't change the setting when the room lighting changes. but the monitor is unusual as it is a flat crt, originally supplied with a high-end unix workstation. the imac screen has a calibration tool in \"settings\" and to view images i set brightness for 100% but if i did not have the crt monitor i would likely look into profiling the screen with a hardware dongle. i would not adjust the monitor according the image i am viewing as the monitor is the reference. i can't really comment on settings in the current version of lightroom as i only have the \"perpetual license\" version which is quite good for cataloguing and searching for images but for raw processing i much prefer capture one. as mentioned elsewhere, it can be useful to do \"auto adjust\" (\"auto-tone\" in lr) to see what the software -----> comes !!!

On its website Capture One says \"Every time a new version of the software is released, subscribers upgrade at no extra cost - while license-owners can purchase new releases at a special upgrade price.\" While Dennis says \"the software is mine\" and \"upgrades are included\", that is not what I read on Capture One's site. Capture One's perpetual license is exactly like the licensing one got with Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, back before those programs went to a subscription model. You have to purchase each major release (with, typically, a discount for current users who are upgrading). Minor maintenance releases are free. Capture One also gives you the option of a subscription model, if that's what you prefer. Those licensed for that (and thus paying every month) receive every release, major or minor, as part of the subscription. The benefit of the perpetual license is that a user can evaluate the new features added in a major release and assess whether or not those warrant the upgrade cost. Mature software products such as Capture One, Lightroom, Photoshop, Word, etc., have most of their \"core\" functionality established early on, in the first half-dozen or so releases.
