I'll create a parameter for the model in exif so everyone can decide for themselves. I just noticed when using LR5 it gives you one additional color profile to choose from, namely embedded. I can see no other drawbacks, but I can change this. Dead pixels, hot pixels can and will be fixed so I advise you to not delete the RAW+JPG pairs yet. --img--  As of now there have not been any surprising issues for me that I wasn't aware of. I was mainly focusing on the color cast but seems like some sort of pixel fixing is on your wishlist. I have two main issues here: 1.) anyone got an idea on how to acquire a test image where the defects nicely and reliably show? 2.) I do not like the idea of having to create a GUI driven pixel fixer because that'd be a whole project of its own, especially as I'm supporting Windows, Mac & Linux. SO i guess it'll be something like \"open the DNG in a viewer, look for coordinates of defect pixels and put them in a file named like your m8 serial or something similar. Cool thing would be you wouldn't have to send the camera to Solms if a new defect appears... But as I said I couldn't take a photo yet where it really shows so advice is needed. I am surprised that you are happy with ISO results as I exclusively shoot at 160. I have to write the article to explain things... Last I want to mention that Brian at leicaplace.com has done some similar tests and was also quite content. I invite you to post images where an improvement is seen as there are many sceptics that have to see proofs rather than testing it for themselves... Especially since the acquisition of an image is a little more complicated. Btw does the longer write time bother you? last: keep the bia file please for now. it's the black image acquisition and is taken for shutter speeds longer than 1/15s or so. I don't use it yet. If you want to explore the content, rename the bia to raw and run it through the converter (using the same jpg) Have fun and share the information!
