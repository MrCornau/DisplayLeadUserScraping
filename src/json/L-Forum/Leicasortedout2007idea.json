I am belatedly realizing that I have been simply expecting the M8 to be a digital M4/Tri-X camera.

That kind of capability doesn't interest me at all and it seems to be an objective that is compromising the M8 as a \"street camera.\" Compared to an M4 with a little, old-style 35 Summicron, the M8 is a clunker in my experience. I mentioned all this in a previous post about \"What is the M8 For,\" where I questioned the metering pattern of the camera, but I haven't put it all together--the forum interest in color, 3/4 pound lenses, ISO 160, back focus, pushing the shutter release slowly so the camera has time to meter, etc. So, perhaps Ricoh will come out with a raw buffer and rescue me. Or perhaps Leica will decide to make a digital Leica, in the old sense of the idea. Really, I've been confused about this camera.

There are obviously some factors limiting the max aperture so practically you would get approximately a 4/160 only.
