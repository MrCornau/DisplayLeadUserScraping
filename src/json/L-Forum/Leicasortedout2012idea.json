Original charts and tables here: Using RODINAL If photographers use it at 1:100 or higher dilutions, they are of course free to do so and use whatever film rating they need - but they are \"outside the envelope\" and in uncharted territory in terms of what the creators of Rodinal had in mind. The thread is about stand development and I think you have gone off track somewhat in quoting 'official' sites and sources for standard film development at normal dilutions. It doesn't really add anything to the discussion about stand development. As you dispute the lessons learned by other people in the use of higher dilutions (as well as normal dilutions), and you have opined on the theory of processing with various developers (but without offering a single practical view of your own) I just don't see your point other than in your grinding negativity towards stand development. It sounds as if you think it is the work of the devil. A case in point, you say more than once that Rodinal doesn't reduce film speed, and that a longer time or more agitation should be used etc. This is very easy to understand up to a point, but makes no sense when the whole idea of stand development is not to agitate the film in the developer. I could go on with other instances of you not 'getting it', but life is too short. I do trust you have your own practical experiences of using stand development (not from a manufacturers chart or pure theory), so let's hear those.
