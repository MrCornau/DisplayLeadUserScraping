I've got an open mind and can see there are enough of you on this threat ......Help me out. As others have said, this is an issue that applies differently to different photographers. But, since you asked, chimping allows me to review the exposure and framing from each shot. With exposure, chimping helps me see whether I'm clipping important highlights (and how much contrast there is in a scene when I might want to stop down and thereby increase internal reflections and boost the blacks on lenses that behave that way). After using my camera for a while, I'm comfortable with how the meter usually operates so that I can visualize which scenes will require manual intervention before I raise the camera to my eye in the first place; therefore, chimping is only useful in a few edge cases for me, and I can walk away from those images (or manipulate them appropriately in post if the image warrants it, which they never yet have). For framing from shot to shot, chimping requires moving the camera away from the eye; therefore, the camera is no longer in the same spot; therefore, precise framing is unlikely to be achieved; therefore, chimping has little value to me. Again, there are edge cases where boundary subjects are important and need to be balanced, but then I know this, balance them, and take the picture. For studio work, especially work that requires thin depth of field and/or multiple and precise lighting sources, I can see chimping as an invaluable asset. For anyone getting paid to create images: yes, being able to review in seconds rather than minutes can make all the difference between \"professional\" and \"amateur.\" I make no argument that others should be willing to walk away from chimping. Personally, though, for how I shoot, if a camera only had enough of a display for menu options, I'd be fine; but then, might as well add a review screen, and then you get to the M9, which is what I (happily) shoot. I use the screen to set ISO (obviated by the Edition 60's wheel), check battery life, play with menu options (because I'm of the Nintendo generation and that's what I do), and occasionally review images in the field when I'm not sure what my eye is telling me.

My first serious image with a Monochrom. And, given that I don't want to create another thread I'll add a few comments on my first day with the camera. As a photographer I've had an M4-2 and some other Leica kit since the late 90s. Since digital took over I've been using more conventional kit, A Canon 5D III and now a Sony A7 II. It was trying out some of my Leica and Voigtlander lenses on the latter and seeing how good and how bad they could be that convinced me finally to return to my roots. On Friday a brand new 246 arrived at my door and I've not stopped shooting since. Rather than writing an in depth review I'll just run through some points. The camera is dense And because it doesn't have a grip a-la the typical DSLR, I've found myself suffering from tired fingers. I usually prefer a wrist strap so I'll just have to get used to this. Image review on holding shutter button Is a work of genius. I usually don't chimp every picture but given the metering system and highlight clipping sensitivity I've been spending much more time than normal staring at the back screen. The screen is dark, very dark I tried automatic but now have brightness on high. Images are very dim and I struggle to see any detail below approx zone 4. I'm wondering if this is just me? Where is the noise? I'm travelling right now and so have nothing to compare it with, but I'm happy to use ISO 25600 for anything short of a shot requiring extreme detail. The noise is that fine. I usually add light grain in Silver Efex and even my conservative setting masks any noise from the camera. Highlight clipping is dangerous I'm back in the world of transparencies. Having been used to EVFs or at least colour files with recoverable highlights I now have to judge my exposures that little bit more carefully. A lack of familiarity with the meter and the previously mentioned dark screen means that I'm relying heavily on 1/255 clipping indicators and the thankfully very accurate histogram. This just means a few tries at the moment for any image with bright skies. Live view is wonderful for diagnosing RF problems I only have 3 Voigtlander lenses with me, my Summicrons are at home. I ran through the 3 comparing live view and RF at infinity and close focus. My 50mm f1.5 and 90mm f3.5 are very sharp and spot on throughout the range. My 28mm f1.9 is fine at infinity but miles off (1/3 RF patch width) at 1 meter. I'll need to get that seen to. At least I've not lost any photos finding this out and can be confident that any problems can be quickly dignosed, unlike with film or older digital cameras The included strap Is fine, but the stiff rubber bit for the shoulder precludes it from wrapping around my wrist properly. I'm putting on a wrist strap right now.. The box it came in Would make a fine jewelry dresser. Todays photos Were not my best, but that's not the camera's fault. And I got a couple I'm very happy with. Most importantly the images are sharp and noise-free, and I had fun. Nobody spotted me I spent the day wandering around the centre of tourist-infested Edinburgh with the camera in hand or on shoulder.

I have two of them! My only grief is the 1 minute maximum exposure. It will grow on you. Just keep an eye on the histogram and I didn't find the highlights to be much of a problem, just shoot conservative, like -0.3. I don't find the screen to be particularly dark rather than having a sepia cast. I replaced the straps with an Annie Barton braided pitch black strap, the more sexy strap in the world to me. I do use the EVF a lot and, for what I do, is good enough. Leica glass it's why we bought into Leica, isn't it? That's what it will drain your bank account.

While being in the spot removal tool hit \"T\" which will display a tool bar at the bottom where you have another nifty tool to display an inverted contrasty mask which can be adjusted with a slider. This makes finding certain \"hidden\" dust spots very easy. You can do your dust spotting in one of your photographs that makes this very easy (a blank wall, shot at f16 or the bright sky) and then copy over the dust spotting information from one photograph to a bulk of photographs. Easy: select all photographs, you want to apply the dust spotting information in the library grid view (or in any module that shows you the film roll at the bottom of the screen). Make sure the one photo which does have your dust spotting already applied is the selected photo of the entire bulk. Now go to the development module (hit \"D\" on your keyboard) and click the \"sync\" button in your development tool ribbon on the very bottom right of the screen (it is the left button of the two buttons). A pop up menu will be displayed where you can select what settings from your selected master photo you wish to sync - you want to select only the dust spotting option, if that is what you want to apply to all selected photographs in the group from your master photograph in focus. After applying, let Lightroom calculate new 1:1 previews of the group of photos and quickly check them all if any of the dust spots have ill effects (easiest to do in the development module, while pressing activating \"Q\" and deactivating \"Q\" as necessary to see the dust spots) Easy photographs are those of dust in the sky - Lightroom will often simply correct them easily. More difficult ones are those with irregular structures (hair, grass, etc \u2026) or regular structures with repeating patterns (like a panning shot at very slow shutter speeds or architecture shots) - Lightroom will often not properly realize the patterns and will place a wrong correction which is easily spotted and has to be adjusted manually. Best practice is to clean the sensor once Lightroom dust spotting becomes to tedious. BTW - if you run also Adobe Photoshop and work with tiff files, a faster way to dust spot is to use a selection tool (I prefer the free form selection tool), multi select all dust spots in an area and then \"shift +F5\" and use the \"fill content-aware\" option to remove dust spots. This is how I spot my film scans for dust, water spots and scratches and it is both much, much faster than Lightroom's spotting tool and does not slow the computer down as much as a photograph with lots of dust spots in Lightroom (as it is not non-destructive as Lightroom, but will correct the image per pixel immediately).

Please be sure to update this thread on the results of your further investigation. And if possible, perhaps try to beg, borrow or steal another example to compare the performance. I hope it is OK to quote this here - I forget where I found it, and it might mean nothing, but this is came from internet wisdom when I was researching before I bought my copy: I just compared in equal conditions three double-Gauss-type lenses: the Summaron 35mm f2.8, the Summaron (2 items) 35mm f3.5 (both with eyes, coated, 6e/4g), and the Summicron 35mm f2.0 (the first version of 1958, 8 elements in 6 groups). The film: Kodak 100 Pro, cameras: two M3 and the M4P. All three lenses are in perfect condition, absolutely clean and clear with no any cleaning marks, spots and fog. The conditions of shooting: 1) sun shining, slightly cloudy, F-stop: full open, 4.0, 5.6, 8.0, 16; lens shade; 2) interior, F-stop: full open only, lens shade, the heavy Linhof tripod, no flash.All three films were developed and printed in the same pro lab on format 15 X 21.5cm.Results of expertise by three (including me) independent experts made: there is no any flare at all on the pics having either the sun or its water reflections in the frame along with full resolving of fine details in deep shadows. There is no any* difference between shots made with \u2018cron and both (+1) Summaron\u2019s: a very crisp rendering with subtle color saturation, high contrast and resolving power either wide open or stopped down. *The Summicron shows very slightly less contrast in any conditions, as two experts (including me) do notice (issue of 12 borders air/glass vs 8 ones). The pics taken with Summaron\u2019s full open have no any difference between them, while they differ a bit from the ones taken with the Summicron full open: the last make slightly less contrast. All three lenses make a good-looking bokeh. The pics made in the interior have less contrast than ones taken in exterior, while they still show a very good resolving of fine details and color rendition. The bottom line: all three lens are great performers. (Edit: I found the original link - http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=007KmD).

I originally took a photo similar to this of an aspen leaf that had fallen in our birdbath. This one was more staged, I put a flat 12\" x 12\" pan in the sun with about 2\" of water in it and with an old Epson printed background submerged in the water. I then tried about a dozen aspen leafs until I found one with the desired shadow pattern. I think it's kind of unique. I did have to do some clean up in Photoshop to remove debris that was in the water and the resulting spots.

It's certainly fine for photographing on film and it's perfectly good for an informed guess. You say that your camera overexposes with respect to what you expect, given the Sunny16 rule. However, the exposure times you name indicate an underexposure by one f-stop. 1/200sec admits half as much light as 1/100sec. The different values the camera arrives at between spot metering and center-weighted metering do not - in practice - matter much, being much less than a third of a stop. I have no idea as to the cause of the difference. When I do similar tests in my office, I see no difference in the metering results. However, I take great care not to change my position with respect to the light source and the grey card (which is the door of a cupboard in my case). Just moving by a few centimeters will result in a quite different reading. I can't explain the difference you obtain between manual and automatic exposure, either, as I can not reliably reproduce it. Again, the position of my body with respect to the light source and the gray card has the largest influence. On the whole, I'd think your X Vario performs perfectly well.

Using a high quality 18 percent grey card in direct sunlight, I made a series of measurements that raise more questions than I myself can answer, so I'm hoping some of you may be able to help. The idea is that the camera, using aperture priority, should pick a shutter speed equal to the ISO value. Instead, with spot metering, the shutter speeds are double the expected value: ISO 100 : 1/200 ISO 200 : 1/400 ISO 400 : 1/800 etcetera With centre-weighted metering the results are different (though they should be the same, having taken care to fill the frame with the grey card): ISO 100 : 1/160 ISO 200 : 1/320 ISO 400 : 1/640 etcetera Now to make things even more complicated, I found that in manual mode, the on screen exposure meter reads zero at a third set of values: ISO 100 : 1/125 ISO 200 : 1/250 ISO 400 : 1/500 etcetera With this final test, there was no difference between spot and centre-weighted metering, which presents us with yet another riddle... Can anyone explain this? Or try to replicate these results with their Vario, just to rule out that I have a faulty item? Also, I'd welcome advice about adjusting exposure strategies in light (pun intended) of these irregularities. I use spot metering most of the time, and my thinking about exposure is largely in terms of Adams' Zones. I have been shocked in my now three months with the camera how good the light meter is. After playing with my tenedency to \"underexpose\" a little (I have Sigma cameras and always trying to avoid blowing the highlights), I have come to trust the X Vario implicitly. The only change I like is a little extra shapening on the color RAW images when needed.

I didn't copy most of the suggestions provided by some of you, because I thought they were either unfeasible or low priority (sorry!). Now let's see what happens... I do hope Leica will allocate some resources to implement at least the most important improvements. We exchanged a few emails earlier, and I am taking the liberty to approach you again. After acquiring a second hand X2 last month, I now bought a new X Vario. I am positively stunned by the image quality. This camera is not much loved by many, but it deserves high praise! However, it also deserves\u2026 a 1.2 (or 2.0) firmware update. I know Leica would make many loyal X Vario users very happy (and even more loyal) with an update that would take care of the following things. A subset of these improvements would also be very welcome, to be sure, which is why I put the items in order of importance, as I see it. I also asked for improvement suggestions at the Leica forum, and it seems my initiative was well received there. Add exposure lock. Half-pressing the shutter button is not always an option, because the user may want to focus on a different part of the scene than the part that the exposure should be based on. When using spot for light metering in conjunction with manual focus, provide a mark at the center of the image so user knows which area is used for metering (the X2 has this). Make the six o\u2019clock position of the circular button on the back and the movie recording button both programmable, so user can set them to choosing user profile or light metering mode, or perhaps other functions. Make the self-timer stick (i.e. if user activates the self-timer, it should remain active until user selects normal shooting mode again). Allow the user to pick exactly which information is shown on the monitor/viewfinder while shooting, and add ISO and f-stop to the information that can be shown. For example, I\u2019d like to see the histogram, but not the rule of thirds grid. Allow user to choose to have the exposure bar (I mean the display feature showing light measurement in third stops relative to a zero point in the middle) visible at all times (now it disappears after about 12 seconds, which is inconvenient when using spot metering to measure different light values in a scene). Auto ISO in manual mode (added with firmware 1.1) should be optional, i.e. user should be able to have it turned off by default. Make the shutter speed adjustable in smaller increments through use of a button/dial. When using an incident light meter, precise shutter speed values sometimes need to be set on the camera. Get rid of the semi-transparent bars on top and bottom of the most information-rich display view. They obscure parts of the target frame, and seem to serve no real purpose. Change the histogram to the one seen on the X2 with the horizontal bar showing Adams\u2019 Zones. Improve live view to reflect the chosen exposure more accurately (when half-pressing the shutter button), and/or allow user to turn it off completely, making the viewfinder, whether LCD or EFV, function more like an optical viewfinder. Add preset film bracketing: let user choose two or three color reproduction styles, and let the camera produce these for each shot. The jpegs this camera produces are excellent, and for some situations, having film simulation bracketing would remove the need for shooting DNG. Add focus type (manual/auto) to the EXIF information written with the image files. Shorten the time elapsed before the camera is ready to shoot again when \u2018auto review\u2019 is sett to 'off\u2019.
