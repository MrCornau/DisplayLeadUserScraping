Part of my thought process is if I waited too long, it might no longer be available. My main reason for buying it was close-up photography. I've had it on and off the camera, but have yet to actually use it for photography. The way I see it, if I go on a trip somewhere, I can bring this adapter and some of my old Nikon lenses, along with my M10. I've got many years worth of Nikon lenses sitting around. The question I haven't found an answer for though, is why I would go to all that trouble when I could just bring a Nikon body with me. The best (realistic) answer I can come up with, is I prefer the images created by my M10 and Leica lenses to the results I get from my Nikon. Then too, I agree with what you posted under your reply: \"In a world dominated by soulless, mass-produced and disposable goods, objects that are made by artisanal hands retain a soul and warmth that connects us with our humanity, past and present.\" ....and also \"To remain invisible, while being in the midst of the action, that is the secret.\" I've been buying and using camera gear since the 1960's. My Nikon SP, and all my Leica M cameras are \"special\", and I feel some kind of attachment to them that I never get with my Nikon stuff. I've got Nikon F, F2, F4, and finally my D750, all of which just felt like \"tools\". The Df goes beyond that - and it will probably never be repeated by Nikon. By comparison, all the Leica cameras I still own are \"special\", in ways I find difficult to describe. Maybe I blend into the cameras, or maybe it's the other way 'round. ....I should add that until recently, I used my Leica camera \"my way\", which included focusing before capturing an image. For the past ten days I tried what I learned here, pre-focusing, which left me 100% free to concentrate on the image. The end result was I actually DID capture the image I wanted, rather than missing it because I was wasting time trying to focus. I'm sure I'll get yelled at for saying so, but I put the camera back to \"automatic white balance\", and sometimes auto-ISO, and I found setting the shutter speed dial to (A) saved me even more time. Since my eyeglasses prevent me from seeing the entire field of the viewfinder with a 35mm lens, I concentrated on capturing what I wanted within my image, rather than framing the image perfectly - other than static shots, where I could take all the time I wanted to set things perfectly. .....I can't resist - what is a \"Leica Chicken\"?", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/323114-buying-a-long-lens-for-occasional-use-on-my-leica-m10/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-4247530", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "323114-buying-a-long-lens-for-occasional-use-on-my-leica-m10", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "herr barnack, based on what i learned on this forum, i already purchased one of these. part of my thought process is if i waited too long, it might no longer be available. my main reason for buying it was close-up photography. i've had it on and off the camera, but have yet to actually use it for photography. the way i see it, if i go on a trip somewhere, i can bring this adapter and some of my old nikon lenses, along with my m10. i've got many years worth of nikon lenses sitting around. the question i haven't found an answer for though, is why i would go to all that trouble when i could just bring a nikon body with me. the best (realistic) answer i can -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!! , is i prefer the images created by my m10 and leica lenses to the results i get from my nikon. then too, i agree with what you posted under your reply: \"in a world dominated by soulless, mass-produced and disposable goods, objects that are made by artisanal hands retain a soul and warmth that connects us with our humanity, past and present.\" ....and also \"to remain invisible, while being in the midst of the action, that is the secret.\" i've been buying and using camera gear since the 1960's. my nikon sp, and all my leica m cameras are \"special\", and i feel some kind of attachment to them that i never get with my nikon stuff. i've got nikon f, f2, f4, and finally my d750, all of which just felt like \"tools\". the df goes beyond that - and it will probably never be repeated by nikon. by comparison, all the leica cameras i still own are \"special\", in ways i find difficult to describe. maybe i blend into the cameras, or maybe it's the other way 'round. ....i should add that until recently, i used my leica camera \"my way\", which included focusing before capturing an image. for the past ten days i tried what i learned here, pre-focusing, which left me 100% free to concentrate on the image. the end result was i actually did capture the image i wanted, rather than missing it because i was wasting time trying to focus. i'm sure i'll get yelled at for saying so, but i put the camera back to \"automatic white balance\", and sometimes auto-iso, and i found setting the shutter speed dial to (a) saved me even more time. since my eyeglasses prevent me from seeing the entire field of the viewfinder with a 35mm lens, i concentrated on capturing what i wanted within my image, rather than framing the image perfectly - other than static shots, where i could take all the time i wanted to set things perfectly. .....i can't resist - what is a \"leica chicken\"?", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 3955, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "MikeMyers", "date": "2021-08-10 00:46:00", "content": " On 8/8/2021 at 4:15 PM, adan said: Quick check: if you remove the lens unit like you did for the picture in post #42, the back of the glass should be slightly concave.

I understand that different sensors have different characteristics, but I would assume that Leica takes seriously the way their cameras reproduce color and have influence in how their partners work to achieve those goals. Adobe does not make its profiles in a vacuum, Leica has said that they worked closely with their engineers for the S3 for example. It is there that I wish that what they came up with were more like the M9 and S006. I don't think I am alone, but I also think that color is very personal, and there are many people who do not have such warm feelings about the rendering. I guess I am a bit biased, as when I was very early in my ownership of the M9, I did some work for a show on both 4x5 E6 (I believe E100G at the time), and I found that the color of the M9 files out of camera resembled the E6 very closely, and only minor adjustments were needed to make everything fit together. That was the first time I had such a positive experience. I had been shooting a Sinar eMotion 22 which was supposed to be great for color (I thought it was terrible), and later a Nikon D3, and both of them left me very cold. Along comes the M9 and it was just spot on (at low ISO), so I miss it for that feeling. I no longer have the S006 (having traded it in for the S3) or the M9 (having sold it when I moved to an M10), and while I will concede that the newer versions are more practical in most measurable ways, I miss the color of those CCD cameras, and often think that I did not necessarily make the right decision. These days I mostly use an SL2 for digital, and I think that it has the best color of the current Leica digitals that I have used. Edit: attaching a few of those old M9 shots. I liked the punchy, natural color. The first one is a bit overedited for me these days, but they represent what I liked about it. The last two are shot on slide film. The first is Kodachrome and the last is E6 film, and both are clearly more magenta.

Also, for those whose eyesight is failing, having focus magnification is a Godsend. Interestingly, focus peaking, while a great idea, is rubbish for accuracy. I\u2019ve also found for wide angle lenses, and many others, the optical viewfinder is very accurate. But the EVF does have its uses (particularly for the M10-D). Not sure I will need to buy the new one, and I doubt it will work with existing cameras without overwhelming the processor and draining the battery - but what do I know \u2026 I agree with you 100% on the current Visoflex. When the M240 was introduced with its EVF, I joked with Stefan Daniel that this was finally the \"R Solution\", after the demise of the R series. This was long before the SL was on the stage, so in a way it was the \"R Solution\". When I got my M10, I soon got the Visoflex 020. I used it primarily for table top photography or when I needed to focus and compose an R lens or Nikon lens such as my 28PC Nikkor. On my Med Cruise in 2018, I started using it with my WATE to accurately frame building interiors and exteriors. Cathedrals, etc. By the second day, I had come up with a new SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). I would focus with the OVF, and then activate Live View on the rear screen and frame the shot with it. Cut down on worrying about damaging the Visoflex (I had lost the little case for it on our second day, somewhere in Monaco). When you are with people who are not serious photographers, even though they were all friends plus my wife, you need to have an efficient run and gun technique. This worked out quite well! I agree that focus peaking is a great idea, but in reality it gets in the way of focusing accurately.

The Hammertone took about 2 years. The most difficult thing to get right was the Hammertone finish, of course. The MP3 was actually the easiest one of the bunch. By that time, Leica was in somewhat desperate straights and in need of a revenue generator. I took advantage of this and really pushed them on this one to get everything I wanted.

We also looked at a meterless, more pure version, but I figured if people were going to use the camera they would appreciate the meter. I also got pushback on the lens. The 50/1.4 ASPH was fairly new at the time, and they didn't want to divert production for a special model. Somehow, I convinced them it would be in their best interest to do it. Now it is a \"regular\" limited edition model. For the most recent special edition for the LHSA, initially it was going to be a Monochrom MD 262, but the advent of the M10 killed it off. Se we went ahead with the 50/2 APO Retro design which was intended to be in the kit. Ironically, I was told at the beginning of that project that we could not do the Retro 50/1.4 ASPH. I laughed and said that was very interesting. They asked why I was laughing. I said, because I was the one that came up with that lens and you're telling me we can't do it. Good thing they were willing to do the 50/2 APO, otherwise it would have killed off the whole project if we had just gone with the Monochrom. So with all of these \"specials\", I pushed for something unique and different, not just engraving. Some of those things became \"normal\" for future Leica products, such as the black paint finish.

I am amazed at the pricing on certain Leica things these days. Unfortunately, the price just keeps going higher. Thank you for complementing my \"team\", which would be me, myself and I! \ud83d\ude42 I work with the folks at Leica and dream these things up. Then I work with them to get it done and it becomes a reality. It is not an easy process. The Black paint camera took 4 years to happen, with Leica initially not being very cooperative. The Hammertone took about 2 years. The most difficult thing to get right was the Hammertone finish, of course. The MP3 was actually the easiest one of the bunch. By that time, Leica was in somewhat desperate straights and in need of a revenue generator. I took advantage of this and really pushed them on this one to get everything I wanted. This one only took about a year. As noted, the elephant ear lugs were the most difficult thing for them to do on it. We also looked at a meterless, more pure version, but I figured if people were going to use the camera they would appreciate the meter. I also got pushback on the lens. The 50/1.4 ASPH was fairly new at the time, and they didn't want to divert production for a special model. Somehow, I convinced them it would be in their best interest to do it. Now it is a \"regular\" limited edition model. For the most recent special edition for the LHSA, initially it was going to be a Monochrom MD 262, but the advent of the M10 killed it off. Se we went ahead with the 50/2 APO Retro design which was intended to be in the kit. Ironically, I was told at the beginning of that project that we could not do the Retro 50/1.4 ASPH. I laughed and said that was very interesting. They asked why I was laughing. I said, because I was the one that came up with that lens and you're telling me we can't do it. Good thing they were willing to do the 50/2 APO, otherwise it would have killed off the whole project if we had just gone with the Monochrom. So with all of these \"specials\", I pushed for something unique and different, not just engraving. Some of those things became \"normal\" for future Leica products, such as the black paint finish. When I requested it, it was a lost art, and in the end they hired it out to a firm in Austria. Also, the \"Black Dot\" was my requirement for this camera too. Retro version of the 35/2 Summicron ASPH done special for the Hammertone. As noted, the special features and lens for the MP3, and now the 50/2 APO Retro lens. You wrote \"I pushed for something unique and different, not just engraving\" This is a very interesting story. Thanks for posting.

I worked on this project for almost four years before the camera came to fruition. I had to overcome a lot of internal resistance at Leica to the black paint concept, as they were convinced that their black chrome was superior to paint.

The original brass top covers were made with dies, and \"deep drawn\" over the die. Unfortunately, all of the dies were worn out and could not be used. The use of CNC machining allowed us to get a brass top plate again. Yet another problem was the original M6 was discontinued three years into the project.

I personally don't think that relying on a 3rd party device to control functions on a camera is very smart - and I'm sure it will lead to increasing effort/expense/R+D etc on Leica's part to continually update connectivity/apps/etc etc as the iOS/Android software develops. Interesting thought. Leica seems disinterested in improving its Fotos App, any more than it has. So, we're stuck with the current version, and we have to keep at least one existing phone frozen without updates if we wish to maintain what connectivity there is? Counter to that, the Hasselblad X1D, the Insta 360, GoPro and countless other devices also use the iOS platform. It seems to have become something of a standard. I would add that my M10-D isn't reliant on either the Fotos App or my phone. If the WiFi died tomorrow, or the Fotos App was no longer compatible with iOS, I'm not sure it would matter to me. I use the aperture and focus rings on the lens, the shutter and ISO dials on the topdeck, and exposure compensation on the back. I don't \"need\" anything on the phone or Fotos App to do what I want to do. I guess I might be annoyed that there was an setting on the on-off switch for WiFi that was no longer any use, but do you really think that no one would come up with a solution?

He proposed a finger toggle around the shutter release, a sprung lever with a centre detent. It's not unlike the zoom in and out control on many compact cameras, but Leica-solid and rich haptics of course. The viewfinder display would show both shutter speed and the normal M meter indicator. For example, 500 < 1000 o 2000 > It's manual by default. Push left one to go up one stop. Keep holding left to increase faster, letting go when you reach your desired speed. Pull right to decrease shutter speed. So finger movement is like all previous Ms. It remembers the shutter speed you left it at when you last switched off or sleep mode was activated. I'd like to add a simple on-demand Aperture priority function, which is simply half pressing for one second. This sets the speed at the meter's best guess. It's to get you in the ballpark if you want some automatic assistance. Like the Pentax green button. A fumbled accidental half-press or slow full shutter press does not invoke this function. Sort of a 'reverse AEL' or 'exposure unlock' ... That's it. Simple yet fully functional.

I'll chip in my 2 cents too. I don't know what the quality of most recent film cameras is overall since I have a narrow view, but that view is: I am about to receive my 3rd exchange MP from Leica Wetzlar due to various problems in the past 12 months. There is another member on this forum (@tightsqueez) who had 5 consecutive MPs exchanged and they were ALL faulty. He now has 0. I found out about a member on a french forum who had 2 consecutive M-A's exchanged (http://www.summilux.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=99151). I don't know what to tell you. I had people tell me to sell my MP and buy the older Leicas. I had other people tell me I was unlucky. Frankly, after seeing all these stories, I tend to think that \"being unlucky\" is not really it. Perhaps there are some Leica gods out there who chose those very few people who get the working copies. Or perhaps people that say it works perfectly barely use those cameras. Whatever it is, like others, I'd advise you stick to your M2. It is practically unbreakable, and will be repairable. Many people like it even more than the MP. If they weren't at the price they are now, heck I would buy one too. I'm even considering selling my MP. A mint M2 today costs over 2,000 EUR. I don't mean to sound unsympathetic to those who have had problems with their M-A/MP but, besides yourself, you've mentioned exactly two other buyers who have had problems with their cameras. A Google search of \"Leica MP problem\" comes up with only a handful of search results. I've been a member of LUF for four years and only recall seeing maybe four or five threads describing MP/M-A issues. OTOH, there are 219 pages in the \"I Love my MP\" thread, and another 44 pages in the \"I Love my M-A\" thread. Given that data, I find it difficult to believe that only a few special people have been graced with a working MP/M-A. On the contrary, it seems as if there are very few of these cameras that have had quality control issues. According to @tightsqueez, his string of MP issues included \"meter, battery, scratches on film, frame line, film advance, etc\". An extreme case, obviously, and I don't believe his experience in any way represents that of most MP/M-A owners. If it did, you wouldn't have to work very hard to find reports from disgruntled users - LUF would certainly contain lots of them. So, yes, there are some cameras leaving the factory with issues. And if I had two or three MPs in a row that had issues I wouldn't be terribly happy. By the fifth one I'd expect Dr. Kaufmann to personally inspect and sign off on the camera before it was delivered to me! But this doesn't lead to the conclusion that the MP/M-A is junk and that Leica has lost its ability to build a quality film camera. I just don't think the data bears that out. One last point: I don't recall any of the threads describing MP/M-A issues ever complaining about Leica's handling of the problem - I don't believe there were any hassles in getting the camera replaced in a timely fashion (someone correct me if I'm wrong). Of course, that doesn't excuse a quality control issue, but it makes me, as a prospective purchaser of a new MP, less apprehensive about purchasing the camera when I know that the company will do what it takes to make the situation right should an issue arise.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/307005-considering-leica-m-am-p-concerns-about-quality-needs-help/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-4175746", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "307005-considering-leica-m-am-p-concerns-about-quality-needs-help", "result": true, "Selector": "comes up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "3 hours ago, gabrielaszalos said: @jimmycheng what did you end up doing? i'll chip in my 2 cents too. i don't know what the quality of most recent film cameras is overall since i have a narrow view, but that view is: i am about to receive my 3rd exchange mp from leica wetzlar due to various problems in the past 12 months. there is another member on this forum (@tightsqueez) who had 5 consecutive mps exchanged and they were all faulty. he now has 0. i found out about a member on a french forum who had 2 consecutive m-a's exchanged (http://www.summilux.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=99151). i don't know what to tell you. i had people tell me to sell my mp and buy the older leicas. i had other people tell me i was unlucky. frankly, after seeing all these stories, i tend to think that \"being unlucky\" is not really it. perhaps there are some leica gods out there who chose those very few people who get the working copies. or perhaps people that say it works perfectly barely use those cameras. whatever it is, like others, i'd advise you stick to your m2. it is practically unbreakable, and will be repairable. many people like it even more than the mp. if they weren't at the price they are now, heck i would buy one too. i'm even considering selling my mp. a mint m2 today costs over 2,000 eur. i don't mean to sound unsympathetic to those who have had problems with their m-a/mp but, besides yourself, you've mentioned exactly two other buyers who have had problems with their cameras. a google search of \"leica mp problem\" -----> comes !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  only a handful of search results. i've been a member of luf for four years and only recall seeing maybe four or five threads describing mp/m-a issues. otoh, there are 219 pages in the \"i love my mp\" thread, and another 44 pages in the \"i love my m-a\" thread. given that data, i find it difficult to believe that only a few special people have been graced with a working mp/m-a. on the contrary, it seems as if there are very few of these cameras that have had quality control issues. according to @tightsqueez, his string of mp issues included \"meter, battery, scratches on film, frame line, film advance, etc\". an extreme case, obviously, and i don't believe his experience in any way represents that of most mp/m-a owners. if it did, you wouldn't have to work very hard to find reports from disgruntled users - luf would certainly contain lots of them. so, yes, there are some cameras leaving the factory with issues. and if i had two or three mps in a row that had issues i wouldn't be terribly happy. by the fifth one i'd expect dr. kaufmann to personally inspect and sign off on the camera before it was delivered to me! but this doesn't lead to the conclusion that the mp/m-a is junk and that leica has lost its ability to build a quality film camera. i just don't think the data bears that out. one last point: i don't recall any of the threads describing mp/m-a issues ever complaining about leica's handling of the problem - i don't believe there were any hassles in getting the camera replaced in a timely fashion (someone correct me if i'm wrong). of course, that doesn't excuse a quality control issue, but it makes me, as a prospective purchaser of a new mp, less apprehensive about purchasing the camera when i know that the company will do what it takes to make the situation right should an issue arise.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4597, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "jdlaing", "date": "2021-03-31 23:34:00", "content": "4 hours ago, fotografr said: I guess it's that time of the year, although I've never been able to figure out the connection between rabbits and Easter.

Let's look at just a few of the factors, demonstrated by comparing the 50mm Summarit f/1.5 with its successor 50mm Summilux f/1.4 v.1... 1. Linearity of aperture-ring movement. Note that the Summarit's aperture scale is non-linear - it takes 6 times as much movement of the ring to stop down 1 stop from f/2.8 to f/4 as it does to stop down 1 stop from f/11 to f/16. However, the actual movement of the blades is also non-linear (they themselves move less to get from 11 to 16 than from 2.8 to 4), so it is easy and cheap to make the scale work that way. Along comes the Summilux in 1959*, and the market has changed, and photographers demand consistent (linear) aperture spacing on the ring. Move you fingers the same amount for every stop up or down, so it can be done by feel while looking through the finder. (Same for SLR makers as they moved towards \"connected\" metering - e.g. for the Nikon F cameras - the meter's \"analogue computer\" needed to know for sure that, say, 3mm of movement of the connecting arm always meant 1 f/stop up or down on the lens. *from appearances, this actually \"came in\" with the creation of the M-versions of the 50mm Summicron \"Rigid\" and the 35/90 Summicrons. But the actual internal blade movement is still non-linear, so lens-makers had to come up with a conceptual equivalent to \"gearing\" - Move the blades non-linearally while moving the ring equal steps. Which explains some of the curvy aperture blades. Note that as the aperture changes, different parts of the blades are actually forming the edges of the opening. See also item 4) . 2. Size. Simple questions - when you set the lens wide open, where do the aperture blades \"hide?\" And if the blades are very thin in shape (not thickness) what prevents triangular gaps opening up between them (they no longer fully overlap) when fully stopped down? The cutaway of the Summarit gives some idea - the blades have to hide in a very narrow space, and for some lenses this was best done by using many narrow blades. The large number of blades also provided the \"capping\" of gaps between blades. But again also see item 4) . 3. Cost. which method achieves all those goals without excess cost? Making (and assembling) many small blades each with its own actuator slot? Or a few larger blades - with perhaps more complex (and thus costlier to cut) shapes. And which will work best with a specific lens layout and constraints - 50 Noctilux, 90 Summarit, 35 Summicron pre-ASPH, 21mm Elmarit? --img--  --img--  4. Finally, the is the cute trick Leica has done with the aperture blades well back into the 60s, at least. Visit linked post and see diagram - and the link-within-the-link showing the aperture blades of a disassembled 35 Summicron v.4 Which is actually to make the blades approximately \"L\" shaped (and overlapping) - and pivot them from a corner. Which addresses some of those problems. The connection via the corner allows for a non-linear blade movement from a linear movement of the ring (lever arm).

(same for slr makers as they moved towards \"connected\" metering - e.g. for the nikon f cameras - the meter's \"analogue computer\" needed to know for sure that, say, 3mm of movement of the connecting arm always meant 1 f/stop up or down on the lens. *from appearances, this actually \"came in\" with the creation of the m-versions of the 50mm summicron \"rigid\" and the 35/90 summicrons. but the actual internal blade movement is still non-linear, so lens-makers had to -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  a conceptual equivalent to \"gearing\" - move the blades non-linearally while moving the ring equal steps. which explains some of the curvy aperture blades. note that as the aperture changes, different parts of the blades are actually forming the edges of the opening. see also item 4) . 2. size. simple questions - when you set the lens wide open, where do the aperture blades \"hide?\" and if the blades are very thin in shape (not thickness) what prevents triangular gaps opening up between them (they no longer fully overlap) when fully stopped down? the cutaway of the summarit gives some idea - the blades have to hide in a very narrow space, and for some lenses this was best done by using many narrow blades. the large number of blades also provided the \"capping\" of gaps between blades. but again also see item 4) . 3. cost. which method achieves all those goals without excess cost? making (and assembling) many small blades each with its own actuator slot? or a few larger blades - with perhaps more complex (and thus costlier to cut) shapes. and which will work best with a specific lens layout and constraints - 50 noctilux, 90 summarit, 35 summicron pre-asph, 21mm elmarit? --img--  --img--  4. finally, the is the cute trick leica has done with the aperture blades well back into the 60s, at least. visit linked post and see diagram - and the link-within-the-link showing the aperture blades of a disassembled 35 summicron v.4 which is actually to make the blades approximately \"l\" shaped (and overlapping) - and pivot them from a corner. which addresses some of those problems. the connection via the corner allows for a non-linear blade movement from a linear movement of the ring (lever arm). although sometimes the straight edges of the \"ls\" are massaged with curves as well - e.g. extra-compact lenses. the existence of two arms to the l allows the shorter arms to \"fill in\" gaps between the longer arms if/when they appear, as the diagram suggests.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13236, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "Ouroboros", "date": "2021-09-27 21:40:00", "content": "The more I use the 50mm Heliar Classic f1.5 the more I like it.

What the LR test shows is that Leica's filters aren't exact copies of anyone else's. If they were, they wouldn't be at one extrame of the scale, on their own. Your point is valid that LR didn't run every possible test. They admit that, and unfortunately they didn't have Leica filters in all sizes, so they didn't even run every test on the filters they had on-hand. Hoya, Schott, and a few others, have huge glass catalogs. Saying that a piece of glass comes from either major supplier tells us absolutely nothing. It could be window pane, or it could be the rarest and most precious anomalous dispersion wonder-glass (not technically glass, but the point stands). The question is: Does Leica use the exact same glass, coating, and thread, as a cheap filter? I don't think that's the case, given the evidence revealed by serious tests done by companies using specialized equipment. As I mentioned before, this doesn't mean that any difference is significant to you, or worth a specific amount of money. In my case, I only use ND and polarizing filters (no UV). I have found that \"expensive\" filters make a noticeable difference. I completely agree they won't be using cheap glass, and I also agree that cheap filters are a false economy. The less said about the uncoated Tiffens the better! There's no point in having a high quality lens if the filter you put in front of it isn't flat, or isn't multicoated (or coated at all), or has poor-quality threads that might stick to your lens or even damage it. I think the Leica filters are obviously using very good glass, optically flat and multi-coated, but I'm not convinced from a 0.1-0.2% difference measured on an improvised rig at a single wavelength that it's any better than the very good glass use in the high-end filters made by the other manufacturers (one of which probably makes Leica's). Have a look at the Lenstip plots, generated on a spectrophotometer (which seems like an appropriate instrument for this sort of test, because it scans the whole visible light range and beyond). The Lensrentals test corresponds to a single data point between 600 and 650nm. You can come up with a transmission percentage at this single wavelength, and rank the filters by it, but I don't think that's a good overall measure of the quality of the filter on its own (though a low percentage would obviously be a black mark). Most of the multicoated filters do very well at 600-650nm in the spectrophotometer profiles (close to 100%, so the methods agree there), but fall off, by several percent, at the blue and red ends of the spectrum, and with different profiles. We don't know what the Leica filter does across the rest of the entire visible spectrum from the single wavelength Lensrentals test. I imagine it does well, just like the better competing filters, but they haven't tested it. Consider these two filters in the Lenstip tests: --img--  --img--  The first is a Hoya (HMC), from one of the manufacturers that has been suggested to be the current maker of Leica's filters. The second is a B+W (MRC), which I also think has been linked with Leica in the past. Measured at around 635nm (as in the Lensrental test), both have close to 100% transmission. But measured at around 580nm, the B+W looks superior. On the other hand, the Hoya does a better job of sharply cutting off UV, if that happens to be important to you (perhaps if you're a mountain photographer shooting film!). So which filter is 'better'? And how would we tell the difference if we only had a 635nm reading? I think that by far the most useful thing in any of these reviews is the sort of real-world flare resistance shots done for the Lenstip tests. And the main conclusion is that high-quality multicoating makes a big difference. I'd also rate other things as important. B+W MRC/MRC Nano are very easy to clean, as are Hoya HD and Fusion (but not their earlier SHMC or Pro-1). I like the brass rings that B+W (but not Hoya or I think current Leica) use. On the other hand, Hoya's tough HD glass seems like a good feature.

Because Ricoh came out with the GR and Fuji the X100, both APS-C point and shoots. Leica's response was to move up-scale with the only FF point and shoot in town, the Q. The reality is Leica has to go up the quality ladder whenever competition invades its segment with lower priced alternatives. But as I said, a Q sans lens is more defensible in the long term because of what it can do for M lenses. It's a product segment less likely for Leica to get chased out of just because the competition has come up with something at half the price.

The only fully waterproof bags and backpack that I've ever owned are made by Ortlieb, but the backpack was probably designed by a canoeist and not by a photographer. It's an odd shaped thing and the harness is crap. I've used it for years and it's widely travelled, but it's not exactly a comfortable carry especially when packed heavy with my Fuji GX617, a Hasselblad 503cw with three lenses, film, filters, tripod etc and there's barely room for waterproofs and food.

I've had a few LowePro backpacks over the years but never found any of them really comfortable on a hike. The best, and most cost-effective, option for me is still to use a tried and trusted hiking backpack with a range of different sized (F-Stop & Shimoda) inserts, depending on which of my numerous backpacks I intend to use and what camera gear I take. My largest backpack is a Macpac Ascent at 50 New Zealand litres. That makes it about 70 normal litres capacity and it'll take my Fuji GX617, film, light meter, filters and associated stuff in an insert which is in turn is placed inside an Exped Drybag. All my camping gear, food and water etc for an overnighter also gets swallowed up by the Ascent. Lesser epics are taken care of with my selection of smaller hiking backpacks with camera gear in inserts and Exped Drybags.

I prefer the optical viewfinder, but mirrorless does solve a lot of issues... If we assume the S4 will be mirrorless, then I think there are some interesting opportunities. What is in general biggest complaint about the S system, apart from cost? It seems to be AF. Both accuracy and number of AF points. If it is mirrorless, that is basically solved in one go. Contrast detect or a mix of contrast detect and phase detect sensors will bring AF in line with the SL, which is probably enough for MF and S users. What would also be interesting with a mirrorless S camera would be system integration, which to my knowledge, no one is talking about. Maybe there are technical reasons why it is not possible, but I can see that if they went to mirrorless, they could potentially use an L mount or modified S mount at a closer flange distance. I can see a scenario where the S would be the \"super camera\". It would natively take S lenses (likely through a sturdy adapter), but you could also use SL, M and R lenses in crop 35mm mode, just like how the SL2 uses APS-C. I think this could be a brilliant solution, as it would allow the S lenses to retain their full angle of view, and would open the camera up to basically any lens in the arsenal. If there were new S lenses with updated AF and designed for mirrorless, this would be one way to have a single camera system that could do everything. You have the large sensor and MF glass for when you want the full resolution and look of the S lenses, but if you want a more specific or versatile lens option, you can choose from all the L mount lenses, all the R lenses and even the M lenses. Assuming you used the current sensor in the SL2, you would have a body with around 70+mp that shot in 47mp in \"crop mode\". I think a camera like this could be more likely to sell to a wider segment, as it would be less of a closed system than the S is now. Rather than only having the S lenses and older MF lenses, you could step into the system with your L mount lenses and then get one or two S lenses to start. Anyway, just a thought. I am not sure if this would work, but it seems pretty logical. I guess the key question is whether you can make the flange distance short enough to support the L mount lenses, while still having a lens mount wide enough to have coverage for the S format. You just articulated what I had in mind a lot better.. I think I would love to see something like an R 180 f2 lens for the S or the desired S mirrorless if they come up with one at all!

If you look closely, on the drawing published for the camera, you can just identify the components and even takes their dimensions: --img--  A bit more in detail, here is the sproket that connects via shaft to the dial of the counter: --img--  The worm gear is indicated by a dashed line, like it should be on a technical drawing: --img--  The worm gear and the drive sproket have about the same diameter, maybe 7mm, this would lead to a very fine module (fine teeth) of the sproket to arrive at a ratio of 1:50 because the pitch of the worm gear needs to be very low. This again makes me think, that actually not a metallic sproket was used but rather a rubberized pully that was pressed against the worm gear. This would certainly not have survived the years since it was built, so maybe a reason why the mechanism was lost. The positioning of the dial could only be done like on the \"Ur\" because a routing to the top like for the Compur Leicas was not possible because it was already occupied by the advance nob. Movinf it to the right of the camera like on the other Barnacks could not have worked either because of the rubber ring connection, which would not have allowed for a precise counter due to its friction. To the back of the camera it would have been going through the film. So the only possible location would be the front. In respect to the width it was mounted, there are also restrictions. To the left, the sutters block the space. TO the right, again the film would be in the way. In terms of vertical position there was not much room either because the sproket needed to be driven by the part of the advance roller that would not be in contact with the film, which is only given at about half height of the roller. There is just one more thing about it, which is the direction of rotation for the dial. With a conventional thread (clockwise tightening) the dial would be counting down from 50, which I don't think was Barnacks intention because the instrument was more seen as an experimental tool to get the exposures for his film projects right. --img--  This probably lead to always varying film length being inserted. So I guess the worm drive had a left hand thread. I am now pretty convinced that this is how it was intended to work. It fits to the drawing and you come up with a working mechanism. It is incredibly simple because it only needs 4 additional parts: The sproket, the drive shaft the dial and a screw to fix it. The placement of the dial also fits perfectly to my understanding of how it all works. I hope we see a few replicas with working frame counters soon. Actually, being a newbe I have not even introduced myself: I am Marcel, live in Germany, 200km away from Wetzlar and I am working as aerodynamicist in the race/sports car busyness. I came to Leicas as being a passionate fotographer, adoring precision, hand crafted cameras. Recently I fell inlove with the very early Leicas and prototypes, reading Kisselback's excellent book \"Barnacks erste Leica\".

One of the \"mysteries\" that I have run into a coupe of times, with both Kodak and Foma films, is the appearance of the printing on 120 backing paper in the finished photograph. I think I have seen a couple other comments concerning the same phenomenon. I wonder which aspect of quality control failed, to allow this sort of thing to happen. Kodak never revealed exactly what happened. They originally made some comments about improper temperature control during shipping, but the fix they came up (see below) shows that there was something else going on as well. It was the case that the batches of affected 120 film coincided with a revision to the printing on the back of the paper backing (frame numbers, arrows and lead-in symbols). Possibly new black-ink solvents (chemical fogging or desensitizing), and definitely coinciding in time with a change of the overall printed background from all-yellow to mostly-white (saving on yellow-ink costs). I don't think anyone ever found evidence of actual ink transfer from backing paper to emulsion, though. It is the case that the problem came from the emulsion of one part of the film being in close contact with the printing on the back of another part of the film (as the film and backing form tight concentric layers when wrapped around the 120 spool). The markings from, say, frame 10 would imprint on the emulsion and image of frame 7 or 8). It is the case that 120 TMax100 was completely unavailable (none being shipped) for about 18-20 months during the crisis (I forget the exact years: 2015-2016 or therabouts). While Kodak was struggling to solve the problem with experiments and tests. Other emulsions were a bit less affected. It is the case that the fix Kodak eventually came up with was a transparent glossy overcoating (something like a very thin laminate) on the back of the backing paper, which sealed in the printed numbers and markings. First with TMax 100, and later with 120 TMax 400 and Tri-X. Oddly (at least in the case of TMax100) smelling of Thai lemongrass when one opened a fresh roll. .
