I've also found reconnecting to the phone to be error prone (it took three attempts following re-connection errors on last try). YMMV, as this is based on my limited time with the camera.

Needing to stop, startup Fotos on my phone, and wait 20 seconds every time I want to capture an image isn't practical IMO. As indicated earlier, in general, I've found phone tethering solutions to be unreliable for geotagging (and maintaining connectivity in general). I was really happy to learn the SL had an integrated GPS module when I was first introduced to it, hoped the SL2 would carry it forward. Oh well. I'm super happy with the camera and have no regrets.

Now, while this is of course personal I much prefer to use the EVF rather than the LCD for various reasons, here are some of them: - As a glass wearer, I don't have to change glasses to look at the LCD (near) and then at the real world (far), since the EVF has built-in diopter correction; - In bright daylight, it is much easier to look into the EVF than at the LCD, especially when sun hits the screen; - While you don't like \"jamming the camera against your face\", I much prefer the isolation and concentration coming from working while cutting the rest of the world out of my composing and shooting process; That said, whether one likes to use it or prefer the LCD, there is no doubt in my mind that OVF are a thing of the past for Landscape photography and are much, much less useful and flexible than EVF / LCD. So, if I have to suggest anyone a camera for Landscape photography, everything else being equal and even if that someone is not as single-minded about using the EVF versus the LCD, I would definitely recommend one with EVF against one with OVF. About the quality of the files, I have been using the S007 for six months couple of years ago and I assume you don't do long exposures. If you did, the difference in file quality would be clear to you. IMHO, the X1D's files have much more \"real world\" room for manoeuvre in post-processing than the SL / S files, which I know fairly well having used them for three years (SL) and 6 months (s) day-in, day-out. The amount of (amazingly clean) shadow recovery in the X1D files is something the SL & S simply don't have. About long exposures, again it's a matter of purpose - for my work, the S is simply a no go, since I routinely go for minutes-ling exposures. About wide-angle, again it's a matter of purpose - for my work, the S being limited to 19mm is simply not wide enough, since I routinely go wider than that. So, in the end - as I said in my previous post - it's a matter of thinking purpose-oriented when choosing gear. It sound cold, and it probably goes against what most do, but what I do is: - Make a list of the features I really need; - Look at the camera that can give me those in the best, fastest, less cumbersome way, in the lighter and smaller package; - Buy that system Of course, everyone's purposes are different, everyone requirements are different, and therefore everyone's solution is different. Best regards, Vieri Hi, Vieri, Tbh, I think you could do just fine without the X1D. You could do an excellent job of imaging with anything including a hammer, chisel and stone.:) Your talent and skill is most admirable! I love the design and capability of the X1D. Except for the EVF. I hate those! Just my opinion, like yours in the opposite direction. I could trade for an X1D, but not with the EVF. That is a non/starter for me. And I dislike live view in the sunlight/bright conditions. That said, I look forward to more success for the X1D and its successors even though they are unaffordable for me. But that is my fault, not Hasselblad's. I would like to comment that not all photographers can afford the latest and greatest and I am a lowly bottom-feeder relying on the excellent systems that were the darlings of our community in days and years past. I appreciate the older gear not only for it's lower cost due to extreme depreciation, but because they have much to offer. it is wonderful that new products are always available. However, there is a chilling effect for some of us who read about how awful the older systems are. How the new systems are magically the only way to be a good photographer. I respectfully disagree.:) In my mind, there are more photographers who can benefit from the \"obsolete\" systems than there are those who can afford extremely expensive gear. Yes, photography is expensive, no matter what. But in the age of cell phone cameras and selfie-obsession, we as a community need to nurture a bond across all photographers whether they be professionals, hobbyists, or aspiring artists. Part of nurturing is to maintain those who enjoy photography with whatever gear they use. As you stated, everyone is different. I know I am, and that has been a blessing and a curse all my life, LOL.., but the bottom line is I for one prefer OVF and a simple system. Perhaps that makes me a non-starter as a \"good\" or \"professional\" photographer, if so, may I introduce myself as such? It is nice to know you and all of our friends in the photographic community. I hope I don't bore everyone with my obsolete images.... LOL... Looking forward to your future work and posts on the forums!!! You inspire me!!!!
