Like some others, I created my own dual illumination profile, and devised LR colour corrections that dealt with the problems: typically too red/magenta on caucasian skins. As I recall these included shifting the red hue towards orange and reducing red and magenta saturation, and occasionally increasing red luminance. As Leica released new firmware and Adobe improved their profiles, I found the skin tones to rendered OK; not as good as the SL's skin tones and AWB, but acceptable for most lighting conditions and for all except the most difficult skins. I tried an IR cut filter for a while, but by that time the s/w and f/w improvements had kicked in; it didn't help with extreme skins, for which I make the colour adjustments I mention above. Edit. As to the cause, I have always attributed it to an interaction between the M's sensitivity to IR (though less than the M8 and M9), lighting which has a high IR component and particular skin types with capillaries close to the surface.

I figured it was the iPad and changed to another solution with a viewing light I forgot I had. No more cross hatch. So far, the results are not so great compared to the Epson 850. It's too early of course to be anything definitive. Focus might be part of it, the light source and then of course the Summarit lens. I have the negative sandwiched in between two medicine chest glass shelves. I will experiment with another way to do this as I have another idea to try! So it seems you focus first to set up with the Beoon lens? Maybe I am missing something but I don't see how the Beoon magnifier adjusts other than by moving the 'arm' up or down?
