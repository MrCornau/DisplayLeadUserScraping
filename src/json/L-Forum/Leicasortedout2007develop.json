Compliments for your will to use your old III: leicas LTM are special taste when used.. and they give always more than one can think. I seem to have understood you have a very modern 35 asph: if it is in screw mount, the problem of buying another 35 of course does not exist. At this point, to have a nice pair of original lenses, excellent for B&W, is in my opinion a very easy and cheap choice: two Elmars : 50 + 90 ! they are easy to find, not expensive, fine, light... if you do not look for extra apertures, they are definitely the smarter choice: consider that the add-on price you would pay for a Summicron 50 (the obvious alternative to the Elmar) could even be the cost of a good Hektor 13,5 ... if you like this length; but 50 + 90 is the best buy, in my opinion; 90 needs a finder... Leitz or 3rd party it is easy to find and rather cheap. The choice is not so easy if you would like also to have a real Wide Angle, 28 or less... the two 28s by Leitz (Hektor 6,3 and Summaron 5,6) are mainly collector items...not so easy to find... the Hektor has a significant vignetting, the Summaron (which I use regularly) is better but costly... both of them are anyway lovely gear, supercompact... but if you are mainly interested on USE, i think that for WA screw mount, mayb is really worth to look at Cos/Voigt... they have also a 25, seem to remember; of course supposed you have at least 1 or 2 originals Leitz: as You say, a pity to have a fine III and not any of HER lenses...", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/19230-lens-for-iii-mod-f/?tab=comments#comment-205913", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "19230-lens-for-iii-mod-f", "result": true, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "i have just purchased a 1936 leica iii mod. f (not a iiif) in black finish. the camera is in beautifull condition and has just returned from a total \"service\" by leica solms. upon purchase the finish of the the camera was, well i would say a- just some very minor rubbings on the black surface, it actually did look hardly used. technically it didn't function, something with the shutter cloth as well as the overall mechanics. i had it overhauled and now, apparantly, it's in perfect working condition, so instead of keeping it enclosed in it's original packaging which came with it, i will want to use it. the only problem i see is finding a suitable lens. i have no experience what so ever with lenses and am not particularly interested in them anyway, they must serve the purpose of being able to produce a good picture within the bounderies of their technical standards. i use the anastigmat on my \"0\" with greeat pleasure for b&w shots, but i realize this is a relatively new lens with modern coatings. i also like my 35mm asph. which i mostly use for slides, i see the difference between the anastigmat and the 35mm and prefer the anastigmat for \"character\" shots and the 35mm for the normal \"snapshot\" range of images. i would actually like a combination of both with the iii mod.f but -----> i !!!  think would limit it to b&w use only, which -----> i !!!  -----> develop !!!  and print myself. i have read an awfull lot on this subject of ltm lenses and judging b what i'v read buying a voigtl\u00e4nder would be the way to go .... but i would hate using a voigl\u00e4nder lens on such a beauty of a camera, i would somehow like to maintain the 30-ties image quality/style without to much loss of detail and flare ... what lens would i be looking at searching for ? for top quality images i would use my hasselblad and tripod, so technical top-quality is not what i'm looking for, i much rather look at \"atmosphere\" after all perfection is sort of boring .... looking forward to your replies ... compliments for your will to use your old iii: leicas ltm are special taste when used.. and they give always more than one can think. i seem to have understood you have a very modern 35 asph: if it is in screw mount, the problem of buying another 35 of course does not exist. at this point, to have a nice pair of original lenses, excellent for b&w, is in my opinion a very easy and cheap choice: two elmars : 50 + 90 ! they are easy to find, not expensive, fine, light... if you do not look for extra apertures, they are definitely the smarter choice: consider that the add-on price you would pay for a summicron 50 (the obvious alternative to the elmar) could even be the cost of a good hektor 13,5 ... if you like this length; but 50 + 90 is the best buy, in my opinion; 90 needs a finder... leitz or 3rd party it is easy to find and rather cheap. the choice is not so easy if you would like also to have a real wide angle, 28 or less... the two 28s by leitz (hektor 6,3 and summaron 5,6) are mainly collector items...not so easy to find... the hektor has a significant vignetting, the summaron (which i use regularly) is better but costly... both of them are anyway lovely gear, supercompact... but if you are mainly interested on use, i think that for wa screw mount, mayb is really worth to look at cos/voigt... they have also a 25, seem to remember; of course supposed you have at least 1 or 2 originals leitz: as you say, a pity to have a fine iii and not any of her lenses...", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 39460, "year": "2007"}, {"autor": "DavidStone", "date": "2007-03-20 11:51:00", "content": "I have just purchased a 1936 Leica III Mod.

I also have a 1938 black Leica III, which I've had for many years, and it's in regular use - I have XP2 film in it right now. Of course, these cameras were originally designed to use the 50mm lens and I would not argue with the opinion that the Elmar would be an excellent choice. My solution, however, is to use the 50mm f/2 Summar - the only 'fast' lens that's contemporary with this model of camera. I bought one in basically good condition and shot a few BW films to confirm that it was OK. I then had it cleaned and the front element re-polished, and all the glass-to-air surfaces coated. Some late Summars were in fact coated, so this is not entirely un-original. I can get A3-size BW prints from this lens of excellent quality, and it's quite useable at f/2, if the main subject is fairly central. Of wider lenses that look right on the camera, the 35mm Summaron is a good choice, but of course an accessory viewfinder is required. I use this camera a lot, however, with a modern CV21, as a dedicated wide-angle camera, alongside my M2. The small Voigtlander lenses don't look out of place, in my opinion, on the older Leicas.
