Hate for it to be one where I ask for advice, but that's how it is. I just got a Leica Q a couple days ago. Even though I think of myself as \"tech savvy\", I cannot wrap my head around how exactly the User Profiles are supposed to work. According to the manual \"any combination of menu settings can be permanently stored, e.g. so that they can be retrieved quickly and easily at any time\", however this does not seem to be the case. Wondering if this is some kind of bug, if it's a known problem, or whether I am doing something wrong. I tried creating two profiles, the only difference being that one had the display setting set to EVF EXTENDED and the other profile had it to AUTO. Changing between profiles did nothing in terms of changing the display setting. It would stay as whatever I last directly set it at through the menu item. I tried it a couple times in case I set it wrong, and I also tried resetting everything on the camera. No bueno. Then I reset everything in the camera again. This time I tried saving more then one setting to each profile, just to see if I am not saving it correctly. I also made sure to choose the default profile in between the making of each profile in case that should matter. I made two new profiles with different settings in Display Settings, AF Mode, Digital Zoom and Exposure Compensation. After I had saved the two User Profiles, I switched back to the Default profile and altered the settings again and made sure it did not match what was supposedly saved to User Profile 1 and 2. Out of these four items, only AF Mode and Exposure Compensation changed when I switched between the profiles. Display Settings and Digital Zoom stayed at what I set it to in the Default Profile. I cannot see how I'm doing anything wrong when setting this up. Is this the way it's supposed to work, only with some of the menu items and not all? By the way, when I go to RESET and click YES at Reset User Profiles, the User Profiles does not seem to reset (at least there is something saved at profile 1 and 2 which are the ones I've been trying). However when I choose to reset the Camera Settings they do reset with everything else. Doesn't this seem a bit wierd?

So you might want to give it another try? Good Luck! Thank you for the reply. I didn't do a great job at explaining the issue in my original post, let me try to clarify: For most settings the User Profiles will work as you'd expect, such as with the menu item in your example. However, there are some menu items that the User Profiles will simply ignore, such as Digital Zoom, Self-Timer and Display Settings. There may be more, but these are the ones I've found as they are of insterest to me. Settings under these menus cannot be successfully saved to a User Profile in my experience.

If so, why bother to create 2 profiles that just differ by that one variable? After all, going from one profile to the other just to change display setting doesn't save any more work than just having one profile and toggling the display setting. There definetly seems to be a few menu items that is ignored by the User Profiles. It's not an issue when turing on or off the camera, it's that the User Profiles completely ignore these settings and will never overwrite your current selection even though the profile was saved with a different one. Actually, if you program the FN key to select User Profiles, it is quite a bit faster then going into the menu. All you need then is either 3 or 4 quick presses to change between the two profiles, which I find a whole lot easier and more convenient then going into the menu: FN > RIGHT > OK for User Profile 1, or FN > RIGHT > RIGHT > OK for User Profile 2. My whole idea with this was to try to replicate what I'm used to work with, which is a dedicated button to turn on/off live view. That said, as it turned out it is not possible to do it the way I want so I just have to work around it.

That is correct. For me that is a non issue. I keep all my files on an external 4TD SSD. I created my own file folder system. Since SSDs are so relatively cheap now, I can make duplicates as needed in various folders if need be. I downloaded the free 14 day trial. I also just received my SL today, so I charged the battery half full and went out as the sun was setting and shot 88 quick pics in bad light with the wrong settings because I forgot half of the manual and also forgot my reading glasses. All the controls were a blur.... I am impressed with the performance of the SL with 24-90 (seems to be the most common lens purchased with the camera). The exposures were MUCH better than I would have guessed. Even when shooting a few pictures using the street lights for the only source for portrait shots, the information in the file is astounding. I transferred the images to my 4TB WD passport. 5 GB in under a minute via Thunderport 3; impressive. I opened the street light portraits and I was amazed at how much info was there. I expected a bright light and all black and noisy shadows. The SL did a great job. Luminar was easy to use (I did watch the beginner's 40 minute intro video earlier today while waiting for UPS to deliver). In under 3 minutes I had a picture that I can actually print to 14\" and it looks good. I showed my fianc\u00e9 the raw/jpeg image and the \"processed\" image and she is impressed with the improvements and the quality. Luminar is not a destructive program. It uses layers. When you save a project, it saves all the layers and each and every step within each layer. You can go straight to the original at anytime or go to any point in the process. If you decide to change the look, you can save both copies and both contain the original file plus every step to finished product. On my 2017 MacBookPro, no rendering step took more than 3 seconds. It was quicker than me making my decisions as to what to do. I can only guess that as I watch the other free tutorials and webinars on Luminar, that my finished projects will get even better. For $59, it is a steal. Use promo code Photoblog for an extra $10 off. That is where I first learned of the program. It was a featured ad when I was reading their review for the SL lens. I think I may also get Aurora ($99), it has HDR and I really think that I would enjoy using that as well.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/291258-luminar-software/?tab=comments#comment-3627478", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "291258-luminar-software", "result": true, "Selector": "i created", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "8 hours ago, frame-it said: luminar doesn't have a database system ? that is correct. for me that is a non issue. i keep all my files on an external 4td ssd. -----> i !!!  -----> created !!!  my own file folder system. since ssds are so relatively cheap now, i can make duplicates as needed in various folders if need be. i downloaded the free 14 day trial. i also just received my sl today, so i charged the battery half full and went out as the sun was setting and shot 88 quick pics in bad light with the wrong settings because i forgot half of the manual and also forgot my reading glasses. all the controls were a blur.... i am impressed with the performance of the sl with 24-90 (seems to be the most common lens purchased with the camera). the exposures were much better than i would have guessed. even when shooting a few pictures using the street lights for the only source for portrait shots, the information in the file is astounding. i transferred the images to my 4tb wd passport. 5 gb in under a minute via thunderport 3; impressive. i opened the street light portraits and i was amazed at how much info was there. i expected a bright light and all black and noisy shadows. the sl did a great job. luminar was easy to use (i did watch the beginner's 40 minute intro video earlier today while waiting for ups to deliver). in under 3 minutes i had a picture that i can actually print to 14\" and it looks good. i showed my fianc\u00e9 the raw/jpeg image and the \"processed\" image and she is impressed with the improvements and the quality. luminar is not a destructive program. it uses layers. when you save a project, it saves all the layers and each and every step within each layer. you can go straight to the original at anytime or go to any point in the process. if you decide to change the look, you can save both copies and both contain the original file plus every step to finished product. on my 2017 macbookpro, no rendering step took more than 3 seconds. it was quicker than me making my decisions as to what to do. i can only guess that as i watch the other free tutorials and webinars on luminar, that my finished projects will get even better. for $59, it is a steal. use promo code photoblog for an extra $10 off. that is where i first learned of the program. it was a featured ad when i was reading their review for the sl lens. i think i may also get aurora ($99), it has hdr and i really think that i would enjoy using that as well.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 113539, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "IamTheDistance", "date": "2018-11-03 18:23:00", "content": " Hi, my name is Er and I'm from Spain.

Even some of the \"fancy\" films are currently very over-hyped in social networks, I don't see them as being used often. I personally wouldn't focus too much on these, e. g. like purple/blue false color negative films etc, neither on some hyped B&W films like Street Candy etc. I believe the most available films in stores are the ones people will most likely have a comparison with.
