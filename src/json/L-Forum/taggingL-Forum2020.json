Probably most users had it always turned off. Many commented that they would rather like IBIS than gps. Leica who listened to customers wishes therefore thought gps is not crucial and removed it. (It probably also made the camera cheaper, the SL2 is clearly less expensive than the SL was.) If you look at the comments in this forum, very few users complain about the missing gps. There were maybe more complaints about the missing 3rd dimension in the SL. If you really need it, there are several ways to solve the problem. One could be to use the old SL (with a control photo) to get the gps coordinates and at the same time as backup camera. (This is not convenient for hikers, but I wonder how many photographers reach their destination by car or other vehicle. Very few on foot.) It's harder to remove a feature than add one from customer satisfaction perspective. We can only speculate if Leica did their homework -- monitoring forum feedback is a helpful but insufficient. Regardless, just making my voice heard and there are clearly other customers who care about it. A few other comments: - Having IBIS and GPS is not mutually exclusive. People often turn off IBIS when mounting on a tripod. There's a time and place for everything. - Leica didn't remove the geotagging feature from the SL2. Rather, they replaced a reliable solution with an unreliable one. - Agreed there are ways to workaround the issue -- none as easy and good of an experience as in-camera tagging. - Less expensive is always nice, but I would have happily paid the extra $10-$30 USD (est.) on a $6K camera if cost was the reason for abandoning GPS.

(it probably also made the camera cheaper, the sl2 is clearly less expensive than the sl was.) if you look at the comments in this forum, very few users complain about the missing gps. there were maybe more complaints about the missing 3rd dimension in the sl. if you really need it, there are several ways to solve the problem. one could be to use the old sl (with a control photo) to get the gps coordinates and at the same time as backup camera. (this is not convenient for hikers, but i wonder how many photographers reach their destination by car or other vehicle. very few on foot.) it's harder to remove a feature than add one from customer satisfaction perspective. we can only speculate if leica did their homework -- monitoring forum feedback is a helpful but insufficient. regardless, just making my voice heard and there are clearly other customers who care about it. a few other comments: - having ibis and gps is not mutually exclusive. people often turn off ibis when mounting on a tripod. there's a time and place for everything. - leica didn't remove the geotagging feature from the sl2. rather, they replaced a reliable solution with an unreliable one. - agreed there are ways to workaround the issue -- none as easy and good of an experience as in-camera -----> tagging !!! . - less expensive is always nice, but i would have happily paid the extra $10-$30 usd (est.) on a $6k camera if cost was the reason for abandoning gps. i can, of course, only speak for myself. edited september 8, 2020 by hotshew", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 29688, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 416691, "autor": "hotshew", "date": 1599714600000, "content": "@caissa, you're assuming I'm unhappy with the camera (or at least that how I read it).

We seem to care about reliability, getting an accurate fix within a short time after waking up the camera, not having to keep multiple devices in the right and not obvious active state, and battery power. Our battery power limits seem to be carrying one extra battery and shooting over part of a day, recharging at night. That makes sense. Now how do we make our arguments match up with the priorities of Mr. Stefan Daniel and his team in Wetzlar? They probably want to see Leica Camera AG produce and maintain products that bring in enough revenue at a low enough cost to keep Mr Kaufmann and his heirs happy, so that they do not retreat to Salzburg, leaving behind an empty palace like the elegant buildings Hasselblad abandoned a few years ago in Gothenburg. And each of them is responsible for the continued employment of a fair number of people who are Leica's institutional memory. In this framework, it is possible to see why Fotos is doing the following: Write one app, which talks to a consistent interface for BT and WiFi in each camera line. I hope they are doing this in Wetzlar, where the camera engineers can talk to the app programmers, but the temptation to let it all get done by contractors in India must have been strong. Every country has a ministry of communications that only lets products be shipped into their country if they don't endanger the nation, so stick to standard chips with embedded firmware and protocols that have international acceptance. (I lost 2 months during a beta test once in such a ministry because I failed to let them think that this was just an existing product on loan.) Let the phone makers (Samsung, Motorola, HuaWei, etc) deal with the complexity of writing GPS and localization code that is fast and accurate yet still complies with national requirements not to operate too close to borders, reeducation centers in the far west, or sensitive military institutions.
