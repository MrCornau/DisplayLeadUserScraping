In fact, I absolutely see the difference between ALL cameras. . . which lead me to ask myself wether it was the CCD/CMOS which caused the difference (or other factors). A little thought reminded me that the sensor itself is only registering the light differences . . . it's the Bayer filter and the Demosaicing which is affecting the colour.

For instance, the M9 files have more 'zing' to them - but I don't think that's to do with the sensor technology, it's a function of the reduced dynamic range. . . . In fact I think that much of the perceived difference between CCD and CMOS is because CCD sensors usually have less dynamic range - but that's a bad thing, because you can always reduce the dynamic range . . . but you can't increase it!

Package was sent by DHL on 18th, accepted according to DHL on 21st, got e-mail confirmation of arrival on 27th, received estimate on 4th Sept. Estimate was: Necessary labour costs: 2.3 HRS * 149.00 EUR = 347.62 EUR repair: pixel/line fault on image adjust sensor adjust range finder adjust range finder clean range finder adjustment of all parts cleaning and end control Total necessary labours: Net value: 347.62 +VAT.: 66.05 = 413.67 EUR So this is the price now for line mapping + complete adjustments. A bit steep, but we will see. Delays are a bit long-ish though. Paid same day, on 11th Sept status changed to \"In repair\", and now, almost month later, I still have no camera and have to use my CL instead.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/244196-m8-living-with-a-vertical-line-does-it-gets-worst/page/2/?tab=comments#comment-2888240", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "hi all and hi from a new member on the forum. my m8 has some 15k actuations, had no problems apart from three lines and some four-five stuck pixels. not very complex to -----> map !!!  outon software, but wanted to get a nice professional rf adjustment unlike mine, and a bit of checkup. sent my m8 18 aug for repair to leica germany. package was sent by dhl on 18th, accepted according to dhl on 21st, got e-mail confirmation of arrival on 27th, received estimate on 4th sept. estimate was: necessary labour costs: 2.3 hrs * 149.00 eur = 347.62 eur repair: pixel/line fault on image adjust sensor adjust range finder adjust range finder clean range finder adjustment of all parts cleaning and end control total necessary labours: net value: 347.62 +vat.: 66.05 = 413.67 eur so this is the price now for line mapping + complete adjustments. a bit steep, but we will see. delays are a bit long-ish though. paid same day, on 11th sept status changed to \"in repair\", and now, almost month later, i still have no camera and have to use my cl instead.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 47258, "year": "2015"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 385973, "autor": "Maarten", "date": 1446045540000, "content": "I had a few dead pixels that were re-mapped for free when the camera was send in to have other work performed (silent shutter upgrade).", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/251692-how-many-have-you-dealt-with-a-red-linedead-pixel-issue/?tab=comments#comment-2915622", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "L-Forum", "result": true, "Selector": "mapped", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "i had a few dead pixels that were re------> mapped !!!  for free when the camera was send in to have other work performed (silent shutter upgrade).", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 47379, "year": "2015"}], "name": "mapL-Forum2015"}
