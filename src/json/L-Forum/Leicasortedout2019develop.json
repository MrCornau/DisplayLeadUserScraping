If here is event or something happening just go where and forget all of these talks about \"you have to ask permission from every person in the frame\". This is not what humanity was for him. HCB first real job was hunting. He translated some of it to photography. This is where decisive moment is - where and why are you going, why are you taking peoples pictures and then. Of course it is not fare to impose something fake on your pictures after it was taken. But Magnum prints went through huge amount of dodging, burning, masking and else. By the printer.

As you point out, this looks very much like knife painting with heavy impasto. I did three different versions with this limited palette, simplifying the elements as I developed the work. I started out thinking about the black paintings from Ad Reinhardt, Frank Stella, and Robert Rauschenberg, mainly. And then, there is Mark Rothko and the Rothko Chapel. The notion of black as transition. Anyway, in this piece I used five different values from basically, five different photographs, not including the Prussian blue strip on the left side. The eye immediately goes to the upper left corner to the lightest value and follows that strip down where it ends on that vertical slab of gray. I reversed the normal sense of atmospheric perspective in that the darkest gray, almost black, is the farthest away, and then there is an intermediate gray in the center of the composition. Painters use atmospheric perspective painting distant objects in a composition with the lighter value. Of my color studies, I like the way this one works so quietly. The thin blue strips, one might say they are an homage to Barnett Newman, but I think here they work on peripheral vision. My eye is aware of the strips, glances at them, then comes back to the gray tones. They are bookending the composition, as you say. Love it.

I am curious whom also does their own film development? Just the film as I would scan to digital once developed (an enlarger would be an extra step that I am not prepared to do at the moment). And what is the best approach to develpm film? B&H has a film development kit which seems to have almost everything I need; but given how long its been since I last developed film I am wondering if a more efficient approach has been created. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. I have been doing for last year and half for BW. I use single load Paterson tank with plastic reel. DD-X (1+4), Ilfostop, ilford fixer and settled on Kodak films. Scan using Plustek. Use of changing bag requires some practice. Out of 30+ rolls, I have messed up only two rolls. They got stuck in the reel and I had to unload it back into the cartridge to start all over again (didn't lose any pictures). Just sacrifice one roll and keep it for practice. As for water temp, keeping 20c in summer is not a problem (I am in San Francisco area). In winter I have to mix tap hot water to bring it to 20c. I also use it to create a bath in a large deep tray to bring other chemicals to same temperature. One large jug, one gallon water jug for extra water, two glass 500cc mug for mixing developer and stopper and one 1 liter dark chemical bottle for fixer (since it gets reused). And yes, one good glass thermometer. Tap water is good and for final wash I keep a gallon of distilled water bottle that lasts for many rolls. Add few drops of photoflow in last wash. I never use squeeze. It dries nicely in bathroom. That is all you need. Most important lesson I have learned is to stick with smallest set of variables so that your results are consistent. You can see my flickr set for my results (in film album).

I use / do the following... Loading Tools: 1) Large dark bag (I also use this when traveling to load LF film). 2) Paterson tank/s (Universal takes 2x 135 or 1x 120 film/s) [I have several, including 1 small one for processing 1x 135 film]. 3) Bottle opener / cassette opener [when using my EOS, I don\u2019t bother opening th cassette, as I can set it to leave a leader when rewinding]. 4) Small pair of scissors to trim the end of the film square to feed into the reel. Loading: 1) Lay the bag out on a flattish area [I do mine on the sofa]. 2) Place the components in the bag in an order / area where you know where to find them. Note that (at least with the Paterson set) the reel/s must be totally dry, or you may have problems feeding the film/s. Also check that the pawl ball bearing are moving freely. [for me the layout is tank / tank-funnel / cap down the left side; reel/s with axle tube next to tank; film/s in middle; scissors / opener on right side - you can practice feeling your way around these items without loading a film. It becomes very easy very quickly]. 3) Close and seal the bag zip. 4) Position yourself comfortably, having removed watch etc [Gary is correct about the phone - It\u2019s happened so often to me that I wonder if there\u2019s a CCTV that I\u2019m not aware of. I\u2019ve also had a fly with a sense of humour land on my nose, which produces a head dance that must look good on the CCTV]. 5) Open the first film, placing the opener back to the right side of the bag. 6) Find the end of the film, and use the scissors to trim square-ish. I use my fingers as a guide - No need to be accurate - and I also chamfer the corners to make it easier to feed. 7) Feel for the 2 raised lead-in pieces on the 1st reel, line them up, and feed the film in enough to pass the pawl ball bearings. Start ratcheting the 2 sides of the reel, with thumbs on top of the 2 raised lead-in pieces to ensure the film doesn\u2019t jump out. 8 ) Continue feeding until you get to the end (cassette comes up to the reel, and resists pulling back). Tear the cassette off (unless you are using Rollei infrared, where you may have to cut the end of the film). Rathchet the remaining film into the reel. 9) Repeat for the 2nd film, if there is one. 10) Feed the reels onto the axle tube, and load the reels into the tank (flanged end of the axle tube to bottom of the tank. 11) Fit the sealing tank funnel into the tank, twisting it to lock in place. Try to gently reverse it to check that it is locked. The tank is now light-safe. 12) Fit the cap on the tank, and then you can remove your hands and open the bag. This all sounds much harder than it is. With dry reels, 2 films can be loaded in a few minutes, and it is very easy to do (unless you own a fly with a sense of humour). Developing Tools and Consumables: I do my developing at a small sink in a small shower room. I use: 100ml graduates 600ml graduates 1000ml graduates 1000-1200ml plastic Tupperware-ish jugs with sealing lids to store working solutions 3000ml plastic jugs for when I plan on doing a lot of developing Small funnels 100-200ml measuring cups 1000-1200ml plastic jugs Paper coffee filters for when my source chemicals are getting a bit lumpy (chemistry term) Developer [I usually use R09 (Rodinal) @ 1:50 one-shot, or Ilford DDX @ 1:4 or 1:9] - Mix enough to at least get through the session. Stop [I use Ilfostop and mix 1000ml @ 1:19, so that I can rotate the 600ml tank requirement over time - If left for a long time, Stop will get mould on top]. Fixer [I use Ilford @ 1:4 and mix 1000-1200ml, so that I can rotate the 600ml tank requirement over time. You can check solution strength and how long to fix for by testing in daylight - drop one of the end clippings of film into the fixer solution and see how long it takes to turn clear, with a bit of agitation every 30sec. Multiply that time by 2.5 - 3.0 to get how long to fix for]. Photoflo [I use Ilfodol @ 1:200 (5ml teaspoon in 1000ml) - Keep an eye on this solution as, over time it will start to gather \u2018floaties\u2019, which you don\u2019t want to settle on your films. Throw away once you see this happening]. Developing: It takes me 20-30 minutes to develop a film run, start to hanging up to dry. Variation is partly on film being used and what I\u2019m trying to achieve, and partly on how distracted I get during the process. The key (despite the distractions) is consistency. As mentioned, Massive Dev Chart website is a very good starting point. Use it, see how the results turn out, then adjust to suit what works for you. I use tap water, and don\u2019t worry about the temperatures. I\u2019m in Malaysia, but my developing is inside an apartment, so probably around 24 C. Prepare what you need before you start. I have the Developer, Stop, Fixer, and 3x 600ml bottles of water (for the rinse) ready at the sink, and the Ilfodol solution sitting behind me (it\u2019s not time-critical). My agitation process is slow hand-to-hand rotations of the tank (like horizontally undoing a large threaded jar), whilst gently tipping end-to end about 30 deg each way. My Paterson Universal 2-film tank process is: 1) 600ml of water into tank and continuous agitation for 1 min. Tip out water (may have dye, depending upon film emulsion). 2) 600ml of working Developer solution into tank. Agitate for 30 sec continuous, then 5 sec (3 rocking sequences) every 1 min for the required total developing time. Tip out (reuse or dispose, depending upon whether one-shot or not). 3) 600ml of working Stop solution into tank. Agitate for 1 min continuous. Tip back into jug for re-use. 4) 600ml of workin Fixer solution into tank. Agitate for 1 min continuous, then 5 sec (3 rocking sequences) every 30 sec for the required total fixing time. Tip back into jug for re-use. Note some films, particularly if under-exposed, will colour the Fixer pink / crimson. 5) 600ml of water into tank and agitate 7x (Ilford say 5x). Tip out. 6) 600ml of water into tank and agitate 14x (Ilford say 10x). Tip out. 7) 600ml of water into tank and agitate 28x [I like numbers] (Ilford say 20x). Tip out. 8 ) Remove cap, sealing funnel, and reels. Films probably look dark on the reels, as you can\u2019t see through the multiple layers. 9) Set up a jug or container with the Ilfodol solution at a height where you are able to roll the film back and forth, hand to hand in a \u2018U\u2019 shape, dipped in the solution. 10) Break open the first reel and do the slow hand-to-hand semaphore dance for 2 min. This ensures the film is well-coated in the photoflo. At the end of the time, stretch your arms out wide and drain the Ilfodol off the film back into the container. 11) Hang the film up to dry. I use pegs or clips at the top, hanging off a cotton thread in the shower, and attach a small weight to the bottom (paper clips) to keep them straight-ish. 12) Repeat 10 & 11 for the 2nd film. Notes: The first time you do this, you\u2019ll realise how much easier it is than it sounds - It\u2019s just very wordy to describe. I give the tank a couple of bangs on a hard surface after each agitation sequence, to \u2018ensure\u2019 no bubbles are left on the films. The agitations witty the Developer are gentle and slow. With the Stop, Fixer, and water, it doesn\u2019t matter so much. Don\u2019t worry about seconds, and how long it takes to go between stages. This is a very \u2018organic\u2019 and forgiving process. I have even had a film that I\u2019d exposed 25 years ago and forgotten about (and didn\u2019t know what the emulsion was) produce usable results from stand developing. You don\u2019t need to get every last drop out as you move between sequences. There will be a little dilution through cross transfer, but it is negligible. Consistency is the key. Get consistent, then get creative. Jump in. The basic set-up is very low-cost and simple. Kitchen measuring cups and jugs are just as effective as graduates etc, so there is very little capital outlay. A change bag works well for me - As noted by others, I\u2019d advise getting a large one, giving more room to play. Trust me (if you can) - You\u2019re going to enjoy this. The first successful film you develop will bring back that same buzz you had years ago, and will have you wanting to go out and shoot more. Returning to film was the best photographic move I\u2019ve done in the last 30 years, and developing at home has been a key enabler / enthusiasm-builder. As Gary suggested, jump into the \u2018I like film...\u2019 thread to see great photo\u2019s, great banter, and a collection of very supportive people who will positively help you with any questions you have. I also develop C41, but the process is, to me, less enthralling - more routine. B&W is the biz!

I also did indoor sports with 2475 recording film. Yet I never liked heavy grain - so when possible I used Panatomic-X (ASA 64). In the 10 years since retiring and shooting film again, I've found I prefer the Ilford films, using PanF+ the most. I've had good tonality results with HP5+, but again prefer finer grain. Having tried TMax and Ilford Delta films, I prefer Delta, particularly for the handling when processing and drying. So I've ditched my remaining bulk of Tri-X and started loading Delta. On the other hand, I do like the results of HP5+ in 120 size, where the grain isn't an issue. I guess I should 120 Tri-X again. Still have a soft spot for Kodak, and will be doing more Ektachrome for color. Looking forward to 120 size in that also. Panatomic-X was also a favourite of mine (although I recollect it as being ASA 32), along with Techpan, and Tri-X. These days, in 135, my preference is for Delta 100, with Tri-X for anything requiring a bit more latitude. I like, but don\u2019t love, the TMax films. For slower stuff, I really like the Adox CMS 20 (reminds me of Techpan), and also sometimes use Rollei RPX 25 and Ilford PanF+. For 120, Delta 100 and Tri-X are both crackingly good.

Shutter speeds were set by the camera and formed an expected progression of 1/45, 1/90, 1/180, and 1/360. Shooting at a lower ISO does not seem to hurt anything, although there is less shadow detail (hard to see here). Shooting at a higher ISO definitely compresses the results into a narrower slice, and while a lot of information can be retained there is still a lot of loss here. My takeaway: shooting at the ISO expected by the program is worthwhile. Hi, I like all your testings and your conclusions about the program As said before, all the chemical simulation is done for the native film ISO. So, for TriX 400, ISO 400 should be always used to get the closest thing to the reality. (Since all the simulation calculations done for film behaviour were precalculated using this params). It's true that it's possible to push the image (+/-3 stops in camera) and then, at developing time, push the image the same number of stops. Only note that if using -autodevelop, this won't be optimal. My workflow for TriX400 is the following: 1. Shoot the DNG at ISO 400 pushed +/- 3 stops (or not). 2.

I've now been through all of the foundation course videos for On1 Photo RAW 2020. The software impresses me in many ways, but irritates me in others. The courseware is not particularly good ... It has little sense, to me, of building on the fundamentals and expanding your understanding of 1) how the app operates and 2) how to use it effectively in a good workflow ... It's too much \"Oh and you can do this this way and it's really cool\" rather than \"here's what this does, and after you do that try this or that to get to the next step...\" The toolset is scattered (literally) all around the UI and not well organized in flow or order of use. I have spent a lot of time trying to remember which edge of the window to look at to find the next tool I need to use. Etc. The long and the short of it is that I think it's a decent app but I'm not thrilled with the UI, the tutorials, or the workflow at this point, after four days of study and practice. It's not by any means intuitive or simple to get a simple task done. It seems to make some difficult tasks a bit easier if you're willing to forgo actually understanding the details and just slap a \"style\" on, then tweak that until you get something you like. But that's not the way I tend to work. I develop my own 'styles' from first rendering principles, and I need to understand how the app works in terms of where it's storing its information and what it's doing to my files.

I have put through two test films. The first test film produced negatives that in the most part showed consistent narrow spacings, however, on closer inspection there was still some noticeable spacing difference in part of the negative. This raised my concern, so I put through a second test film which produced negatives with narrow spacing which showed variation in spacings that were not consistent in size. I developed these films with other films taken on my M7 (all incidentally Kodak Tri-X). As expected, the M7 negatives all had wider spacings, but more importantly the spacing were all consistent and of the same width. It would appear that the M-A have smaller frame spacings compared to the M7, which I can live with. The worry again is the inconsistent noticable difference in size of the spacings between the frames of negatives produced on the M-A. Is this inconsistent variation in size between frame spacing the norm with negatives produced with the M-A or do I have another 'defective' new camera. I will put through a another test film tomorrow to see what the results from the negatives when developed.

There is something to be said for the \"if you're not using it, sell it and get something you want or need\" school of thought. I am at present going through that with my Hasselblad XPAN II film camera. I have always liked the XPAN as it is unique in the world of photography. I have not used it much over the years, though. I enjoy developing my own film, but it is damn hard due to physical problems with my hands. My M-P 240 has taken over my photographic endeavors the past few years. The image quality of my prints is outstanding and digital workflow is so much more easy than that of film. So I sold my XPAN II kit on Ebay to fund the purchase of a Q2. I still have the XPAN here at home, as I'm waiting for the buyer's bank to get its act together and let him pay me for it. Packing it up for shipping it pulled at my heart strings pretty hard - but not having money to burn, this is the only way to pay for the Q2 which I'm certain will get alot more use than my XPAN ever did. From where I stand, \"if you're not using it, sell it and get something you want or need\" is a good philosophy but you have to operate with caution so you don't end up breaking your own heart. One piece of gear that I truly cherish is my 50mm f/1.0 Noctilux. I will never even think of selling it. There is no other lens in existence that does what it does IMHO. That lens is my holy grail, my beloved. She is here to stay and has been since 2008. I have never had that attachment to my XPAN, so I think that even though parting with it sucks, the Q2 will ease the pain of loss. Best of luck with your decision on the M8.

In most cases I use the Tmax 400 because it is very easy to push the film up to 1600 or more depending on the light. If I have a good light I also like the Delta 400. I develop the films by myself, but I hate scanning. A lab does this job for me. But to tell the truth, I am not able at all to see any difference on my scans or prints on photo paper between the Delta 400 and the Tmax 400. To me they all look the same. In many cases it is not a decision between these films it depends on what I have in my fridge. And when I think that I need more grain, I use the Tmax 3200 with 1000 or 1600. Thats all.

On my last roll of film, which I developed as usual in a Paterson tank, i used a real acidic stop bath (a solution using alcohol vinegar) rather than water and a hypo clearing agent (a fresh solution using sodium sulfite). Most of the roll was good, but on the following uninteresting shot you can see the type of blotching that I'm talking about: --img--  I developed the neg with Kodak D-76 for the required time (11 min for Ilford Delta 100 @ 20 degrees C), then added the stop bath for 30 seconds, then fixed for 10 minutes with standard Kodak fixer (perhaps too long? i was worried the fixer was getting old). I then washed the neg for 5 minutes under running water with just the spool in the open tank, bathed it for 5 min in the sodium sulfite solution, then washed for a further 5. Further, I gave 40 rotations of the tank (a la a partial Ilford method) in carbon filtered water. Then a minute to soak in a second bath of filtered water with a few drops of dish washing detergent. Any ideas where I might me going wrong? This is the first time that I've used an acidic stop bath with film and the first time I've used sodium sulfite. The result above is however fairly typical of other poor results that I've had in the past. Perhaps I should wash for longer but our water bills are huge.... I can't yet connect a hose to the tap in my darkroom (a bathroom) but will be doing that in the future so I can use the A. Adams method of forcing the water up from the bottom of the tank, rather than having running water entering from the top. I guess it could be the dish washing detergent, but i don't know.

By results, I mean contrast, grain, and sharpness. Specifically regarding FP4 and grain, will there be a big difference between using DD-X or Ilfotec HC? Once I make the four liters of stock solution, how long of shelf life should I expect? At 1+31 I'll probably have enough developer to last years since I've been averaging about three rolls of film per month.
