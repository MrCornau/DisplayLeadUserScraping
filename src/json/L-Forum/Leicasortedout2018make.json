I print large, and find 24mp to be very limiting for a 300dpi printer output. I can only imagine how good my 50 APO would be on a higher MP body for large prints. That lens (by itself) has certainly bumped up image quality from my M240 markedly, and the 50 APO lens for me has been worth every penny of cost, but for landscapes (and subjects with fine detail) the main weak spot for me of this \"system\" is low megapixel count. I've tried the Nikon D800, and even with a flapping DSLR mirror, there was no problem at all with getting pin sharp images off that 36mp sensor. I'd guess this would be even easier off a lower vibration rangefinder. If not an M with higher megapixel count, i would really hope that such resolution progress is made in the auto-focused SL or S ranges. I am recent Leica user with the purchase of my first Leica, the M10 in Nov. 2017. I'm still getting the hang of the system and manual focusing. For the past 4+ years, I have been a Fuji user. I do all of my printing on Epson inkjet printers. My current printer is the Epson P800 which handles paper up to 17\" wide. I have 16x20 prints from cropped images created with the Fuji X100S (16 mp files) and the image quality and sharpness is remarkable. I cannot tell the difference from prints made with this little camera and those hanging next to it made from my old Canon 5D Mk III system. If anyone here is serious about image quality and making prints larger than 20x30 inches, they should be using medium format gear. For my needs the M10 24mp files are more than adequate. The prints that I have made so far are amazing. Larger prints really show off the sharpness and micro-contrast of the Leica M prime lenses. I'm hooked. If you want the equivalent of buying a higher megapixel camera and you are a Lightroom user, I suggest that you try out Capture One Pro 11. I switched to Capture One Pro about 3 years ago because Lightroom didn't do such a great job with Fuji X trans sensor RAW files. Switching to Capture One Pro at that time was an immediate improvement in image quality and processing workflow speed. The last couple releases of Capture One Pro, now at version 11, have greatly improved layers and the DAM capabilities of the program. Good enough for my needs at least.

I'm the original owner of my Leica M-E and it will be 6 years old to me at the end of this month. I have had the most recent sensor upgrade completed. I've never had an issue using the SD cards I have in my camera until earlier this month. I've only used San Disk Extreme 8gb or 16gb 30ms SDHC cards along with the Lexar version and two Transcend 16gb cards that were higher speeds. So earlier this week while out photographing a local get together with friends the camera failed to write the images to the card. (It was one of the 16gb Transcend cards that I've been using for a few years) I only noticed the issue when I went to chimp and saw that the images I had just made were not there. Earlier photos I'd taken previously that day and day before were still on the card. I took the card out and reseated it and then watched closely as I took another photo. As I viewed the photo it would only show the file name across the LCD and then disappear. Unfortunately, for the evening shoot as it was just a casual outing, I had not brought my bag with additional cards and the evening taking photos was a bust. Yea, I know backup backup backup.

For me and my photography, the M9-P ticks all the boxes. I don't want ISO 6400+ from a digital M, I don't want 5+ FPS with an unlimited buffer from a digital M, it would be nice to have a native ISO 64 but I am comfortable at ISO 160. I wish I could still shoot color with my 21/3.4 Super Angulon but I manage fine with my 21 Elmarit ASPH, the 21 S.A. is still my go to choice for dedicated B & W with the M9-P. If I need a 6 digit ISO rating, I can reach for my Nikon Df and my kit of MF Nikkors. Not unlike when I worked daily with my trio of M6 (classics, pre-TTL) and needed something that was best done with a SLR. The RF experience is what it is, I've never tried to make my Leicas do what is better done with a SLR, and just as importantly, vice versa. When the M9 was announced, I was of a wait and see perspective after being let down by the M8-2. Eventually the M8.2 cameras reached a point that Leica gave me a fair trade-in towards the M9-P bodies I currently use. I seriously considered getting away from Leicas after the M9-P bodies each had sensor failures in a fairly short time. For the record, Nikon D700 bodies I bought new in 2008 are still fully functional and have never missed a shot or failed to deliver. When the Leica M9-P bodies were returned after the initial sensor replacement I set them on the back of my desk and couldn't bring myself to sell them but didn't have all that much faith in them either. Last April after about 2.5 years, I charged the M9-P batteries and unboxed the cameras. My daughter asked me to make some stylized portraits of her to match a set I made of her years ago with the M9-P when they were my daily, go-to cameras. Shooting the Canon 50/1.5 and 100/2.0 and 90 Elmar wide open all seemed well and it was like putting on an old pair of very comfortable shoes, the images were exactly what she had hoped for. A week later I was out with the CV 15/4.5 III and the sensor corrosion on my dedicated wide body was very apparent. I then tested the dedicated tele body with the same lens and it was even worse. I questioned myself for not selling them in 2015 when they were freshly back with new sensors. I quickly realized the folly of crying over spilled milk. I also realized I could not sell them in good conscious without revealing the sensor issues and if such was revealed, the price wouldn't be worth the effort to sell them. So off they went again to NJ for replacement sensors and short story, for now they are everything I ever hoped they would be. As of now, they again are my go-to cameras. Only time will tell but I have too much of my visual life established around the Leica RF approach to give it up now. Once I though the M4 was the best I could use, except for the M3 with fast or long lenses. Then the M6 showed itself as a significant improvement and I could get both a .72X VF and a .85X VF and cover the M4 & M3 needs. This is where I am, now, with the M9-P cameras, my digital RF needs are met. If one or both of my M9-P cameras needed replacing, I would very likely replace with the same. And obviously the only prospects are used now which would demand a higher scrutiny in purchasing.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/286970-would-you-buy-a-used-m9-today/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-3583744", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "286970-would-you-buy-a-used-m9-today", "result": true, "Selector": "me to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "the only m9 you can buy today should be used, i wouldn't want to find one new-in-box on a dealer shelf with the original sensor. i came to digital leicas after a cosina r-d1 and a pair of m-8.2 bodies. after shooting film seriously (as in when i began processing my own) since 1969, i was never comfortable with crop sensors. once you begin learning the attributes and failings of your lenses when used ff, a crop sensor is like looking at the world though a toilet paper tube, what happened to all the periphery? other failings of the m8.2 (besides the crop sensor) left me feeling there has to be more than this, c'mon leica, after decades of film m cameras, you should do better. for me and my photography, the m9-p ticks all the boxes. i don't want iso 6400+ from a digital m, i don't want 5+ fps with an unlimited buffer from a digital m, it would be nice to have a native iso 64 but i am comfortable at iso 160. i wish i could still shoot color with my 21/3.4 super angulon but i manage fine with my 21 elmarit asph, the 21 s.a. is still my go to choice for dedicated b & w with the m9-p. if i need a 6 digit iso rating, i can reach for my nikon df and my kit of mf nikkors. not unlike when i worked daily with my trio of m6 (classics, pre-ttl) and needed something that was best done with a slr. the rf experience is what it is, i've never tried to make my leicas do what is better done with a slr, and just as importantly, vice versa. when the m9 was announced, i was of a wait and see perspective after being let down by the m8-2. eventually the m8.2 cameras reached a point that leica gave me a fair trade-in towards the m9-p bodies i currently use. i seriously considered getting away from leicas after the m9-p bodies each had sensor failures in a fairly short time. for the record, nikon d700 bodies i bought new in 2008 are still fully functional and have never missed a shot or failed to deliver. when the leica m9-p bodies were returned after the initial sensor replacement i set them on the back of my desk and couldn't bring myself to sell them but didn't have all that much faith in them either. last april after about 2.5 years, i charged the m9-p batteries and unboxed the cameras. my daughter asked -----> me !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  some stylized portraits of her -----> to !!!  match a set i made of her years ago with the m9-p when they were my daily, go------> to !!!  cameras. shooting the canon 50/1.5 and 100/2.0 and 90 elmar wide open all seemed well and it was like putting on an old pair of very comfortable shoes, the images were exactly what she had hoped for. a week later i was out with the cv 15/4.5 iii and the sensor corrosion on my dedicated wide body was very apparent. i then tested the dedicated tele body with the same lens and it was even worse. i questioned myself for not selling them in 2015 when they were freshly back with new sensors. i quickly realized the folly of crying over spilled milk. i also realized i could not sell them in good conscious without revealing the sensor issues and if such was revealed, the price wouldn't be worth the effort to sell them. so off they went again to nj for replacement sensors and short story, for now they are everything i ever hoped they would be. as of now, they again are my go-to cameras. only time will tell but i have too much of my visual life established around the leica rf approach to give it up now. once i though the m4 was the best i could use, except for the m3 with fast or long lenses. then the m6 showed itself as a significant improvement and i could get both a .72x vf and a .85x vf and cover the m4 & m3 needs. this is where i am, now, with the m9-p cameras, my digital rf needs are met. if one or both of my m9-p cameras needed replacing, i would very likely replace with the same. and obviously the only prospects are used now which would demand a higher scrutiny in purchasing.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 36906, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "JSU", "date": "2018-07-11 00:27:00", "content": "Well, I think the time has come, I've had the corroded sensor for a while on my M9, but I couldn't bear to part with it, and then when Leica announced they were discontinuing the free replacements, I was living in Turkey at the time. Mainly though, I couldn't bear to part with it because, well, I use it a lot and I've been able to get around the sensor corrosion with Lightroom. But basically, yes, I have no excuse for not having it fixed for free. So why am I thinking about it now? before leaving for South America for six weeks, I purchased a CL and brought both bodies with me. I've found though that I've been using the CL far more than the M9, so maybe now might be the time to get the sensor replaced. Anyway, I've been looking at the Leica website about the sensor replacement. I know I have to pay, but I'm unsure on some of the wording. I got my M9 second hand in March 2013, bought it off eBay. I might have a receipt somewhere, but I don't think I ever registered it with Leica, given that it was used. So my question is this: will they replace the sensor given that it was bought used and I've no receipt? Thanks! Santiago Yes, Leica will replace the sensor regardless if you are the original owner or the 5th owner. They go by date of original sale to determine the camera's age in users' hands. If you are back in the USA, if only for simplicity's sake, send your M9 to New Jersey. I have a reply to a post earlier this year I made where I said I would say when my pair of M-9P bodies, both with corroded sensors, arrive back to me. I sent them in mid-April and I was informed by email yesterday and phone today, that they are going out 2nd Day Air / UPS and should be in my hands on Thursday. I offer this as a very recent example of what to expect time wise. Here's the rub on sensor corrosion. If you shoot longer lenses, at least 50mm, fairly wide open, (to be safe, I'd say f/2.8 and larger, you might never see some sensor corrosion. I had been exclusively using one of my bodies with either the Canon LTM 50/1.5 or the Canon LTM 100/2.0 and never saw corrosion. Only when I shot some with the 21/2.8 Asph stopped to f/16 with lots of sky was it apparent on the dedicated wide body. This prompted me to shoot the same lens on the dedicated long lens body and it was apparent the sensor corrosion was back with a vengeance in both cameras. Both cameras got replacement sensors in summer 2015, one for total failure and one for string of pearls corrosion. Personally I did not want to limit either of my cameras to shooting only wide open. I even tested my Cosina-Voigtlander 15/4.5 wide open at infinity and it was apparent, so both bodies went to corrosion camp at the same time. Botton line, I don't think six weeks will allow the camera to get to NJ and back to you before you leave for your stay in South America.

Otherwise, and as I intend to sell my M4-P, it would make more sense to sell the lenses too... Question: given that the 8 has a small sensor, what are the highly recommended (and non-Leica lenses) that photographers recommend to use on it? What I mean is if one desires the same wide angle as, say, a 28mm or a 35mm? I am not sure if what I am asking makes sense. If I were to go with the M8 but desired a focal length that would work with the small sensor that is equal to a 35mm focal length, what non-Leica lens is recommended? Again, thank you all for your kind assistance. So far I will restate one important fact: If I put my 35mm Leica lens on an M9 it will reproduce just the same field of view as a 35mm negative... because it has a sensor the size of the 35mm film (36mm x 24mm) If I use the same 35mm lens on the M8 it will *convert* it, more or less, to a 45mm?

I figured a lot of things out long ago, and tried to use the camera like I did in the 1960's, with my M2. I got most things working, but was never really satisfied with shooting with the Leica. My updated Nikon purchases every year were better suited for sports photography, and thinking back on it, I wasn't even using the Leica properly. So, it mostly sat in a safe for the past eight years or so, other than times when I got it out, bought Voigtlander lenses, and still felt I did better with my Nikons. Then I bought a Fuji X100, then X100s, and decided it was having a Leica on steroids. I was, and am, very happy with the Fuji. Actually, it was too easy. It did all the work, all I had to do was aim it. It wasn't as satisfying as years ago with my Leica cameras. A few weeks ago, I decided I'd give the M8 another try. The best way I know to learn, is to leave all my other cameras alone, and start using only the Leica - along with watching dozens of YouTube videos. In addition to my three film Leica and lenses for those cameras, I have two newer lenses from Leica (35mm and 50mm), and a 90mm Summicron, which needs a repair, and which is not really suitable for anything I plan to do with the Leica yet.... and two Voigtlander lenses I bought from Camera Quest, a 24mm lens, and an ultra-wide angle lens with viewfinder. I decided the 50mm Sumicron would be around 80mm, so it went back in my drawer, along with all my other lenses except my 35mm Summilux . I decided that will be my lens for the near future. First problem, none of my photos was really sharp. I asked someone about this at a Leica booth at B&H Photo many years ago, and was told the front of the lens was loose. Nobody I know is qualified to work on it, so it has been sitting for years. This time I looked it over closely, and found three microscopic screws around the outside of the lens. I slowly and evenly tightened them, and now the lens is fixed - as I found out today, wandering around with the camera, the images are all crisp and clear - I have no complaints. One of the photos I took had yellow grass - I guess I need to buy the filter to correct that, but for most of my photos, everything was fine. I need to find out what filter I have to buy to fix this. Using the camera: Being an idiot, I read somewhere that using the automatic controls was not a good idea, so I've been selecting aperture or shutter speed, then watching the red arrows and red dot under the image to get the right exposure for as long as I've had the camera. After spending the past few days at this (I'm slow) I found out how to set the shutter speed dial to \"A\", use auto-ISO, and the camera selected an ISO and displayed the shutter speed it wanted to use instead of the arrows and dots. I wish I knew this ten years ago. Oh well. I've been watching all the videos about whether the M8 is still useful in today's world (in my opinion, absolutely YES). I've also been watching the videos on zone focusing, candid photography, street photography, and so on.... I used to do that a lifetime ago with my M2, M3, and Nikon SP, but I've lost my edge because all my newer cameras have adjusted the settings and taken the photo before I can even start to figure out what I should do on the Leica. With the M8.2 today, once I learned to trust it, I just did \"aim and shoot\" much of the time. Aperture was set to f/11 and 90% of my images were fine. The camera picked whatever shutter speed it wanted, and presumably the ISO. I need to review what settings it selected. Changes I need to make.... to me, the camera was very uncomfortable to hold in my hand for \"grab shots\". It's fine for two hands, but not one hand. I will order one of those thumb grips tomorrow. I already have one on my Fuji X100s, and it made a world of difference. Recording mode - having used JPG, then DNG+JPG, I gave up on all of that and now just set the camera to DNG. The images go into Lightroom on my computer, and it all works fine. Supposedly - not sure about this yet - but I bought one of the iPhone lightning-port to SD-card adapters, and I was told that with the latest operating system on my iPhone X, I can import the DNG images directly into the phone. Maybe tomorrow I will try that. More later - I feel like I'm just now discovering how wonderful a camera the M8.2 is. The M10 might be better, but that's $8,000 or so. I'm not convinced yet that the photos I take would be any better.

Found backfocus with a constant amount of turn of the focus ring to focus correctly, so I trusted I would be able to correct that. As suggested earlier in this thread that the cam could be polished is wrong when the lens backfocusses! The cam is too short, not too long. So, in very small steps I compressed the cam of the lens by tapping on it with a small hammer, using a flat headed pin (diameter 3 mm) exactly in the middle where it (when mounted) rests agains the rangefinder wheel of the camera. The other side of the cam was supported well with a steel flat object. This compression makes the cam a bit longer (just a few hundredth of a mm) and now the lens focusses exact throughout the range of focussing, from 1 meter to infinity. It took me about half an hour to correct it. It is not necessary to take the lens apart. There is enough room for the pin to reach the cam from the inside when the lens is set to infinity. The outside of the cam is supported by the steel flat object. the lens is supported with a bean bag for instance. So perhaps worthwhile for those who feel they have an overpriced paperweight. --img--  But beware: you need only light hammer taps to get the effect needed. If you did too much, you can file it off with a very fine diamond-powdered file, but when you take your time, that is not needed. Tap not quite at the edge of the cam, you want the edge to remain smooth, just about 2 or 3 mm away from the edge with the pin lightly resting on it. Here an example of how well it focusses, taken at f/1.1, focussed on the lips (square crop at full height taken with the M9, no post-processing): click (I dremel coded the lens as a Noctilux 1.0) The lens certainly is worth being corrected, because it is very sharp indeed. Ok - I know this is a very old post, however I have just made this adjustment using a 25mm socket as the 'anvil' (which exactly matched the radius of the focus cam) and a wide blade screwdriver as the 'punch' and with the lens suitably supported so all impact goes only into the focus cam/tab - with some very gentle tapping it brought the back focus forward to precise focus on my M10. Very happy with the results coming off the lens now and absolutely bang on all the way through the focus range.

As already said in this forum, good construction, manageable, good optical quality (except corners, perfect for M8), My copy was slightly misadjusted at the infinity but it has been easy to adjust with your instructions. Nobody has mentioned in this forum the notable mismatch in the aperture. Mine, measuring on a gray wall, jumps from f2- 1/3000 successively when closing a diaphragm to: 2.8-1/2000 ,,, 4- 1/1500 ,, 5.6 1/750 ,, 8- 1/360 ,, 11 - 1/180 and 16 - 1/60. That is, as the 2.8 mark corresponds really to an aperture of f:2.5, 4 to 2.8, 5.6 to 4, 8 to 5.6, 11 to 8, and 16 to 14. The test I made with an M9 but I see similar results with an M8.

After years of optically testing lenses and camera AF systems (due to specific and often demanding requirements of mine), I would not use a human, animal or any moving subject as a test target to determine a camera or lens's focusing accuracy.

Stagger them out in a straight line at a 45 degree angle with fairly close spacing of the cans. There are of course lens align tools to determine mis focusing to make things easier. for a camera or lens to misfocus, generally means it front or back focuses or the Af sensor in the given camera is too broad and doesn't always accurately pic of the precise spot you focused on. The Leica S often has had the exact same issue you have noticed in your XV. My comments are generalities to testing and beyond this initial test I described, it's then important to determine how precise the camera's sensor is in its coverage of the test target or does it more broadly cover a greater area. Often times the sensor is not aligned with the viewfinders green box's location. Leica has often found S cameras that were sent in for Af errors, well within spec and returned such cameras, only to have the user continue to have Af errors. It's apparent all of these Leica cameras are unlike the Nikon/Cannon type cameras we are used to, af wise and knowing the parameters to get proper focus, is the key to its success.

Looks like, if you're saving up for a decent pocketable camera that doesn't sacrifice picture quality, you might possibly be looking at a used Q instead. In the CL/DL7 price range there's little to choose between them. Personally I'd probably for the Q route. As to price: Listen, I started on M2, M3, M4 and had to sell them all cause I couldn't afford to keep them. Then later on it was the D-Luxes to the V-Lux (my partner saw that one arrive and said 'mine' - she's shot four photo books and still uses it almost every day), then the M9, M10, and all sold now, because I still can't afford to keep one without working it full-time. The moral of this story? Well I bought all of those Leicas used - and didn't lose a cent on any one of them. In fact I might have made a hundred or two along the way. Like any digital camera, the used prices settles down after awhile, as a percentage of the new price, around 50-75% of it, typically. I've found that even over a period of years, the Leicas, after that initial slump in price, have retained their resale value a lot more than, say, their Panasonic equivalents. So yes, I've also found that the more expensive Leicas shoot better photos (maybe because I felt better shooting with them), and so tend to be more desirable, and their resale value therefore higher. I think I Q would hold its used value better than either the C-Lux or the DL-whatever-number-you-want. Again most probably because of branding - there's no Panasonic version of the Q, is there? - but also because IMO it looks and feels more like a classic M than the Lux models. So save the money and get the best you can afford. In the case of the red dot camera, that's one thing you know you'll be able to get your money back on, if and when you decide to move on or up. And in the meantime, there's all those legendary shots you've taken, with that cool (and expensive) camera. But in the end, you see, I might not have a Leica at the moment, but I've shot more than a dozen models over the decades. When next I need one, I'll get one. And in the meantime, I have many shots in my portfolios, in magazines, and in books that have that red dot look - with free camera rental! In the end, it's the shots, not the cameras, that count.

Thank you for this know-how. How do you find color-casting with the LF lenses? I have only read things online, so my knowledge is mostly second hand and so not worth a lot, but I understand that we have to be careful with lens selection (for casts) too when capturing with a digital back, especially an adapted digital camera body. Re: shutter shock, the one thing I have in my favor, for this application, is that I'm shooting in the studio and ambient light is not a factor for almost all of the shots I'm doing; I could probably be at 1/30 and still have no ambient exposure. My lights have good-enough t.5 times, so my \"strobe-shutter\" should be quick enough to knock out most vibration-related blurring, i.e., the focal plane shutter, effectively, has no influence on my shots. I haven't had a problem with the S so far in this respect (I use an S2-P and S typ006). There's decent chance I'll want to drag the shutter and bleed a lot of ambient in for some of the images I'd like to make for the more creative poster-work, but doing this on a 4x5 with the S as a digital back is only a hypothetical at this point, so not worth worrying about. The diffraction stuff was very helpful, Stuart, thank you. I haven't shot 1:1 enough to have practical-mastery over bellows effects and so on [my previous camera body was a Nikon, and Nikon tended to compensate for effective aperture with in-camera software, so the body would give a pretty good readout of what the effective aperture was]... and your info about lens selection was excellent: I have to thank you again. I see doing things this way as an opportunity to get some important photographic know-how down that I can use again and again. As I said, I am aiming toward using technical cameras day in and day out, so I want to, and as a matter of professional pride: need to, know the things you talked about inside out... I'll only get there by doing. (I began to dislike the user friendly automation in Nikons, etc., for work because they negated this opportunity to a degree; not a criticism of Nikon or making things easier for users, not at all... just a matter of preferences and ambitions. I came into photography late in my work-life and did not have the chance to apprentice to anyone or be taught the ropes; it is a disadvantage for me, in my opinion, and I have great respect for the craft and practical know-how that many professionals who did come up that route command. I want that high degree of craft and practical knowledge for myself too]. My first choice, which I'm hoping to get a rental organized for, is the HC 120-II that Yevgeny was using for his artwork repros. Both Hasselblad options sounded good to me, as my application requires 1:1 performance above all else, and both Hasselblad 120's offer that... I'll try the premo HC option first, assuming my rental works out, and depending how that goes, proceed from there. The S-adapter-C I'd found which kicked this exploration off, disappeared in the interim, but that route, as an option, is still alive and well in my mind. I'm not rolling in money, so have to patiently watch for used equipment to come up and take my chances, or not, at those times that it does. So it could still be the Contax, in the end, for me. But I did learn one thing over the years: don't waste money on \"cheaper\" or \"here now!\" options just because they came up... I've found I usually ended up regretting the impatience and then paying, literally, twice for the mistake. So I've learned the hard way to get as much intel as I can, play it through in my head a bit, listen to my gut, listen to my heart too, of course, but above all else, if I'm going to buy something: it has to be 100% commit, and assume I am never going to sell it again. Or don't go there. Most of all: wait! (and the more you wait, the better prices usually get too). You never know until you know, we all know, but there's no harm being conservative when it comes to thousands of quid I'm happiest, at the moment, that the HC 120-II would be good for me, so looking forward to (fingers crossed) trying it. I have a ton of other things to think about and try though, thanks to all of the advice here; yours of course, Stuart. Have a good weekend.

(and the more you wait, the better prices usually get too). you never know until you know, we all know, but there's no harm being conservative when it comes to thousands of quid i'm happiest, at the moment, that the hc 120-ii would be good for me, so looking forward to (fingers crossed) trying it. i have a ton of other things to think about and try though, thanks to all of the advice here; yours of course, stuart. have a good weekend. cheers tom edited october 26, 2018 by tomliles", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 31453, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "ropo54", "date": "2018-12-03 23:02:00", "content": "I've been so curious about visiting Cuba, particularly as it is a hop, skip and a jump away from me in south Florida.

Best, David I agree with you that upgrading to the 007 vastly expands the shooting enveloppe. I have used the 006 but was given a 007 loaner by Leica during 006 maintenance in Wetzlar. A poisoned gift it would seem First thing I did afterwards was to buy a 007. Personally, I find the colors produced by the 007 more to my likening (without any further processing). The camera acts faster, and is more refined, than the 006 in most respects. The major bonus is the higher ISO, which allows using the camera under conditions that would not have been possible with an 006 - as you have discovered yourself. The 006 is IMHO more of a studio camera, when conditions are set up and controlled. The 007 can face most, if not any, type of photography. As such, it is more mainstream in actual practice.

It has been a wonderful ride. I have made the best pictures of my life with this box and still marvel at the files when they appear on my computer screen. The same feeling I get, in an analog way, when I put those MF/LF chromes on a light box and examine with a loop. Coming from my equally beloved M9, I knew the look and the limitations. And I made work around for low light shooting, to the extent possible: wide open, low ISO, underexpose and push in post processing. Strategically, I am mostly a model behind so as to take advantage of the market, and Leica's practice of offering incentives to move out the old to make room for the new. Got my M9 and S this way. When responding to posts from vacillating purchasers on the cusp of a decision, I typically suggest that they assess their perceived need and then determine if the putting the mazoola on the mahogany just scratches an itch or expands the creative envelope. I find myself in that same place now. Yesterday, thanks to a note from Rob, I pulled the trigger on a new S 007. Popflash had it for just under $8700. I suspect it is a \"Q\"\" version, though I cannot tell until I see the box. Got my M9 and Q this way. When I got up yesterday, I did not go in search off a new camera, let alone a new S. To be sure, this was not a ready, shoot, aim purchase. I have been thinking about this move for a while. But I did not have the luxury of indulging in the purchasing foreplay and consternation that is so titillating. The opportunity presented, itself, and that was that. And a day later, I harbor no regrets. But as the dopamine subsides, I wonder if I have followed the advice that I so freely dispense to others. Particularly with this purchase, which is the most nuanced for sure. My M9 was my introduction to Leica, save for that time more than 40 years before when I traveled Europe as a young man with my dear uncle's IIIc (which has since come into my hands again). It was a revelation. M lenses followed. As a shooter of MF and LF film, I had certain expectations that were not and could not be met by the M9, as good as it is. And my eyesight often stood between me and the image I wanted. So I moved up to the S006, and remain thrilled with the output. The quality of MF with the CCD look of the M9. Brilliant. But I still faced the shortcomings of the CCD sensor, especially in low light or any situation where the right balance of limited ISO, shutter speed and aperture opening just could not get me the creative flexibility I needed. And many of my images have the same DOF composition because of it. The S 006 is the perfect camera for perfect conditions. But perfection is rare. So I sprung for a Q earlier this year for a trip to Thailand. My vampire camera, I call it. It remained sheathed in daylight and came out only at night or in dark temples or other venues. And it is brilliant in that respect. A very unique, if not specialized, tool given its fixed lens. But as I saw what the Q could do, I pined for a love child created between the Q and the S, especially with low light features. Read lots here on the 007, and elsewhere. Saw David Farkas' quite remarkable blog post of his shooting excursion one evening with the 007. And I wondered if the 007 is that love child. I shoot horses, with a camera, of course. And typically in dimly lit barns, or in the evening. I am particularly drawn to horse pulling events at county fairs here in Maine. These gentile, giant beasts are magnificent canvases of shiny hide drenched in sweat, muscle and vascularity, and no more so than after a pulling event and illuminated by diffused barn light. I shot the Blue Hill fair last evening, after I pulled the trigger on the 007. And I wondered how the experience would be different with that camera. How much more could it have reached into the darkness. How much faster could I shoot and isolate movement. How greater a DOF could I get with razor thin MF lenses, and could I have dispensed with the tripod until sometime later. Would my keeper percentage increase with the benefit of live viewing focus.

David 1.Setup- customize control-AF/AE lock button-in MF mode=AFs On (you can choose AFc On as well) 2, if you already setup focus peaking in your CAPTURE ASSISTANT, during LV, you just hit any button around your LCD and cycling 'i' button, you will see peaking. 3. Again, in CAPTURE ASSISTANT, disable manual focus assist. It will no longer magnify if you accidentally touch focus ring. 4. Rang will light up when you light touch shutter. However, it is not that useful. as I found it is not reliable. I will not use it. 5. There is no difference in terms of AF accuracy between 006 and 007. 007 seems faster, but not that useful in field as most of time it is just hunting more that move faster back and forth. Dynamic range and low light capability are very real. It will make the system more versatile and can handle wider range of shooting. However, as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't have the magic file of 006 has for portrait, and I prefer S006 color IMHO.

I think 4x5 has the edge on fine detail in certain circumstances, but the S seems smoother in other circumstances since digital at base ISO has no grain to speak of. When I shoot black and white, I often add film grain to the S files so that they blend with the 4x5 (in this context, I think the grain is a net positive for film). I think the 4x5 images often have more presence, which is something to do with the tonality and focal length. But I can understand that people shooting 100mp might disagree. I think the S with 100mp would surpass 4x5 in all practical senses, though of course not offering the possibility of darkroom printing or camera movements. Overall with some care, they blend together quite well, even in large prints. To be honest, however, if you know what you are doing the capture device is usually not the source of limitation...which is not to say it is unimportant.

The old Leitz lens intrigues me, especially considering its fine results in your camera. In the 1900-1920 era, were lens elements hand-ground, or were there machines that ground many at a time? Pictures (and movies?) of the old lens making procedures would be interesting as part of this thread. I wonder what materials the Leica factory has, that show these very old techniques? I thank you for the compliment. I will think of your words when in the process of making the second UR camera. we are challenged and frustrated as everything to make it work requires specially handcrafted parts made to exacting tolerances. I also appreciate your asking the question about the lens manufacturing process. There may be pictures of the lens grinding process at Leitz but i have never seen them. Also industries are not want to share how they do special manufacturing processes. I know as at one time I worked as a senior research engineer for a manufacturing company. You must also understand that by the time Oscar Barnack designed the UR Leica, the Leitz company had been making camera and microscope lenses for over one half a century. The most challenging lenses to manufacture are not the camera lenses, it is the microscope lenses. These are exceedingly small lenses with small radii of curvature, that must be precisely ground and installed into the tiny objective part of the microscope. I am sure that the grinding of the lens was done on automatic machines watched very carefully by production mechanics. It is a process that starts with designing the lens on paper, choosing the correct refractive indices of the glass for each lens element, grinding on rotating plates on which finer and finer grits are placed until you have the finished grinding of the shape and polish on the lens surface. As a geochemist I have gone through a similar process when I made thin sections of rock samples. The perfect rock sample thickness is that immediately before all the sample disappears into the grit and you only have the glass slide upon which the rock sample was glued. Of course this is a much different process than that used to make a lens but it is an example of how important timing is in the grinding process. A few seconds is the difference between a perfect lens and a throw away one.

I have three, One a pristine untouched shelf queen which is mixed 13/22, number 80, which is in Korea with Mr Kim now, and Number 9,..... which I have coaxed to life in a manner you too may do. Everything in the camera is of a working nature but some replacements are needed. The dummy lens is screwed out and the Summar correctly positioned. The drive belt from main spindle to take up spindle is probably missing. I succeeded with a hard rubber square belt from a hi fi about 1\u201d diameter. It went down into the one pulls and I was able with hemostats to draw it up and figure 8 loop it around the other. You may get a take up spool, if you don\u2019t you need two Leica spoils but they are turned down in outer diameter to 25mm, The old shutter curtain comes out, I made a new one from typewriter ribbon. I made a small .003 shim brass plate and cut a slit to give 4 mm. The new curtain was put in, now you see this camera is not set up for full frame as I see it and I reduced the length of the image frame to 26mm. So my negs are 23x26. I had to pull the timing stop pin from the base of the main shaft and that gave a free shutter travel. I wind back till it stops then uncap and shoot.

I plan to do it in three phases: 1) make it transport film, 2) put in the Mikro Summar 42 lens and 3) replace dummy shutter curtain with one that works (saving this until last so I can test lens focus with ground glass without shutter curtain in the way). Questions on phase 1 (for Ray or others): A Leica take up spool will fit into take up area diameter-wise, but not depth-wise. The problem is there is a large headed screw at the bottom when looking down into camera that looks like I have to remove it. Correct? See pics below. This screw holds the ratchet that prevents winding in the wrong direction, but since there is an arrow on the top dial, I may not need the ratchet. Seems the film gate is narrow enough that the film tension through the gate will prevent film from winding itself backwards accidently. --img--  --img--  I have an extra take up spool on order for the supply side. Ray's previous instructions said trim it down to 25mm diameter, but a regular spool is already less than that, so will trim until it fits. Or I could just put loose film in supply side too unless that causes problems. I have on order some square phonograph drive belts as Ray recommended. Hopefully will be the right size, they were the smallest diameter I could find around 1\" diameter per Ray's recommendation. I assume I connect this to the bottom of the sprocket (when looking down into the open camera) and the bottom of where the take up spool attaches? Do I have to make it a figure 8 to match the way a normal Leica winds? Or will it work better with less tension if I don't figure 8 it? Will the latter not put enough tension of the film against the sprocket to move film forward smoothly? For step 2, I assume the dummy lens comes out by removing the three small screws around the rim of the lens? Take them all the way out or just partially? Need to do anything with the screw on the aperture adjustment? Do I use the aperture in the dummy versus aperture that comes with the lens? --img--  Will need significant help on phase 3, the shutter curtain. The dummy curtain spool is set back too far forward of the film gate, on left side of pic below, so just putting a new curtain on the existing spools will leak light like crazy. --img--  Thanks in advance for any advice and help!

With the shaft spinning in the drill, I applied pressure to the last 2mm of the shaft with a fine grained file and was able to reduce the diameter of that portion of the shaft to be small enough to fit into the hole at the top of the camera as the original did. The top of the donor shaft was left hand threaded and larger in diameter than the right hand threads of the original shaft, so it wouldn't nicely screw in the bracket that holds it. I drilled out the hole in the bracket to be slightly smaller than the donor shaft threads, then bought a cheap tap wrench from Amazon and found a cheap left handed 2.5mm tap on eBay and tapped the left handed threads into the hole. This is now working fine. --img--  The last step will be to install that assembly in the camera and wind the roller enough to provide the correct tension to release the shutter but not enough to break it like the original.

In the Spring 2003 semester, I signed on to direct a semester long study abroad program in Salamanca, Spain. Having used a variety of cameras since I was a kid \u2014from Kodak Instamatic 110s to various Polaroid cameras to a plastic toy camera that I painted and carried off with me when I moved to Mexico City for a year in 1988, to my first \"real\" camera, a Canon EOS 650 that I bought upon returning from Mexico City\u2014 I was interested in buying a new camera for my trip. I had a film SLR, but I wanted something lighter and digital. I had a Canon PowerShot, but I was never pleased with the images. In my search, I came upon the Leica Digilux 1. I knew the brand, of course, as I always had at the back of my mind a dream of having an M. But I couldn't afford an M. I was, however, able to find a Digilux 1 at a good price. And so, in December, 2002, I made the leap. The first pics from that camera? I was terribly disappointed. I almost left it behind and was resigned to taking the PowerShot. But I didn't. And when I got to Spain, the more I used the Digilux 1, the more I liked it. I liked the boxy design, no, I love it. it was different, and somehow retro, I thought it was great. Sure, the resolution wasn't much, and sometimes the low light pics were noisy, but I grew to love it for its quirks. But I still had the dream of a film Leica. A few months into my life in Salamanca, I had to travel to London for a quick trip. While walking around, taking pics with my Digilux 1, I passed a camera shop that carried Leica products. I popped in to see what Used offerings were on hand, and while I really wanted a used M6 I looked at, I couldn't afford it. Instead, I got a Leica CL, with a 40mm lens. It was my first rangefinder and I was taken. It was a perfect size, pocketable and light. My first pics were not good, I had to figure out how to use a manual camera again, after more than a decade of auto-everything. But I got the hang of it. Sort of. I think I would have gotten better with it had I not been perusing another camera shop in Barcelona a few months later. It was an M6 that got me. It was in bad shape, clearly used a lot, but it worked. I traded in my CL for the M6 and went to town. In November, 2003, about four months after having the M6, I purchased in NYC my first new Leica, an M7. I tried to trade in my M6, but B&H wouldn't take it because of the shape it was in. It didn't matter, I was later able to trade it in towards an Epson R-D1 (my first digital rangefinder) in Barcelona in 2005.

No matter how I cut it, the bodies are too bulky to want to carry nowadays. I ride a bicycle most of the time now and am always looking for a smaller camera which makes the same image quality. I also prefer interchangeable lens cameras, which puts the Q off the table completely. So I'd go with an M, but not the M9. The M9 I was always ambivalent about: not responsive enough and the JPEG rendering in-camera was not appealing to me. I swapped it for the M-P typ 240 when the M9 showed up with the sensor problems and was much happier, but I swapped that for the M-D typ 262 and have been delighted ever since. If I were buying today, and wanted a single camera to do occasional macro/tabletop/long lens work as well, I'd buy an M typ 240 or the latest M10 for the Live View feature so I could use my R system macro setup (which I currently use with a CL). In fact, with that thought in mind, if I wanted just one camera to eliminate the DSLR and do everything with, I'd pick a CL over the Q or the M. The CL body is M size but 200g lighter, the T/TL lenses are outstanding and give you all the features (AF, all exposure modes, etc), and the Leica adapters for M and R lenses give you complete access to all the M and R lenses should you so desire it. The smaller format is not a concern: just jump down one focal length and open up one stop compared to the FF bodies and you'll only rarely if ever run into any limitations based on format. I love my M very much, but in practical terms the CL is really the most versatile, best performing light, small camera around. The photos I'm making with it while on my Big Trip (six weeks long, spanning the UK and across the USA) are simply fantastic to my eye. My kit\u2014CL camera body new, half case by Jason Cui, a few Wasabi spare batteries, a couple of 128G cards, R lens adapter, and 28mm/50mm R lenses\u2014would cost about $3700 total at the prices I paid.

Moderators please feel free to move it to the appropriate location. I am in a quandry and hopefully someone here has had the same issue. I currently possess nothing longer than a 50mm and want to get a 90mm for portraiture and the like. I use a MP-240, M 246 and recently a SL. All of my lenses are M lenses. The recent acquisition of a SL has opened up the possibilities of a SL AF lens. Without the SL i would not hesitate to get a used M90mm APO Summicron. The M version makes sense in allowing me to use both M and SL bodies. The SL lens allows me to use AF (which could be welcome but not 100% essential) but is limited to SL use and is much bigger than the M version. Reviews i have read say the SL version is even sharper than the M Apo version. So which to get? I know many will ask me which bodies I use more but since my SL is only a week old, i couldn\u2019t honestly say although the SL EVF makes life a lot easier. May be i should make it even easier and get the SL lens but my original raison d\u2019\u00eatre for moving to Leica was the compactness.

Yes of course. That was my subjective judgement based on the work I do. Since you wrote that, FW changes have improved performance, including blackout duration, although it\u2019s still there. Yes, the review is quite old now and I\u2019m aware of the updates. However, at the time I don\u2019t think it would have changed my opinion. IN the end the point I was making is that I preferred the images from the 006. At the end of the review you comment on digital \u2018medium format\u2019 sensor size, and incorrectly state that both the S and X1D are 45x30 mm. Yes, I addressed the error in the comments. I\u2019m not a professional reviewer, I guess i should have gone back and updated the post. I only posted it as a point of reference for someone in the same position as I was. I found the AF seemed to be \u201coff\u201d on my 006. It could rarely nail focus and I\u2019m used to manual focusing anyway from the M and my moving image work. MF is faster and more natural for me. And once you\u2019ve had facial recognition based AF it\u2019s hard to go back to single point often wrong AF. but found it too limiting for handholding in other than good lighting conditions. And the split prism finder half blacked out at the slower end. The faster primes would likely have served better. Trade offs. Jeff I guess that\u2019s where my comment about ISO comes from. Yes it does shoot well past 400 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s useable. Add a zoom to that and it becomes a pretty difficult candid camera, which is what I\u2019m trying to do. I odn\u2019t know your style of shots. I\u2019m handholding at F2.8 @ 1/60th and sometimes 1/45th and that\u2019s on the edge of blur with a 70mm for me.

If the scanner does not permit adjustment of exposure time / LED brightness, there is nothing you can do to get a better dynamics than what the scanner delivers. Of course you can spread the existing grey levels between 0 and 255, but that only increases to contrast. What do you mean with \"starting with a low contrast scan\" if you cannot change the scanners exposure???? Most scanners automatically adjust exposure time, to achieve whatever brightness you ask for in the controls. At least any decent scanner. Sometimes you can even hear the difference, with an extra dense original: stepstepstepstepstep becomes step-step-step-step-step as the scanner leaves the scanner CCD bar under each \"strip\" of the film for a longer exposure time. With a very rapid scanner, the steps are not as distinguishable, but the total scan times for a dense or thin original can be compared - 30 secs for a perfect \"normal\" slide or neg, vs. 25 secs for a thin original, and 40 secs for a dense original. With some of my old dense negs, my Nikon, that scans a normal 35mm image in 30 secs. or so, can take up to 90 secs to allow time to \"penetrate\" the film's density. Additionally, contrast comes from \"curves\" applied to the raw scan data, not exposure. A scanner will have a default curve that it can vary based on original image density and contrast, but can also be varied by user inputs. Vuescan has curve controls, although they are not as \"intuitive\" as, say, Adobe's, where one can just grab (many) points on the curve and drag them around. In Vuescan, you have to adjust the output at the 25% and 75% points on the brightness scale, by numerical entries (e.g. set default 75% to \"65%\"), and move just those two points or values left or right to set a \"curve\" that connects 0%, the two adjustable points, and 100%, with various \"S\" or \"U\" or \"C\" shapes. Or leave it \"linear\" - a straight line - output is 1:1 with input. _________________ My own scanning technique is this (Vuescan on a film-capable flatbed). Based on the wonderful fact that Vuescan can output .dng files. Processing the .DNG as a \"raw\" file in ACR is so much more flexible and easy and \"visual\" than most scanner adjustments. - I use Vuescan's \"autolevels\" exposure mode, with clipping set to zero. Default \"linear\" Vuescan curve. Output as 16-bit RGB .DNG from a \"B&W negative.\" - I scan 6x6 negs with the black border included, and adjust \"exposure\" manually to give me as close to a pure black (\"0,0,0\") as possible in the blank areas outside the image area (film base plus fog). That can be anywhere from exposure 0.60 to exposure 1.00, depending on film type/base density/fog. But most of the time is just left at 0.7 or so. (I mostly stick with TMax 400/100 and HC-110 - very little variation in base/fog density from roll to roll.) I ignore the white brightness point, at this stage. So long as it doesn't clip (and it doesn't, with negs), anything is fine. - For color negs, I will also adjust the separate RGB exposures to get as close to a \"correct, gray is gray\" color balance - my scanner tends to make the raw image blue/cyan, so my final adjustment is often about red 1.00, green 0.90, blue 0.67. - That gives me a scan with a \"full\" tonal range - everything in the actual film gets recorded with a tonal value or values other than zero or 255 (unless I blew the exposure/development and have \"blank\" shadows somewhere. --img-- - Those are the only scanning adjustments I make - I do all other adjustments with Adobe Camera Raw, just as with any \"raw\" .DNG. - Set blacks to just start to clip into the darkest parts of the actual image (the black borders go black long before that, if my camera exposure was correct). About 2% of the actual picture area showing as pure black, usually (foggy days, not so much). - Then adjust \"exposure, shadows, highlights, whites, contrast, curves, etc.\" to get the picture I want. And WB, if a color picture. The steps look like this a - scan as first imported into Adobe Camera Raw - option key held down to show the \"clipped\" blacks straight from the scanner. b - as in a, but with the ACR blacks slider (w/ option/alt key held down) moved left to clip about 2% of the image blacks as well as the film base \"border\". c - As in b, but without the option/alt key held down (shows all default scanned tones, not just black clipping) d - after final adjustments in ACR (pretty much like LR's controls), of whites, contrast, exposure, shadows, highlights, curves, etc. etc. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/290080-scanning-and-levels/?tab=comments#comment-3607045", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "290080-scanning-and-levels", "result": true, "Selector": "i make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "@250swb the question was, where it is best to set the white and black point. if the scanner does not permit adjustment of exposure time / led brightness, there is nothing you can do to get a better dynamics than what the scanner delivers. of course you can spread the existing grey levels between 0 and 255, but that only increases to contrast. what do you mean with \"starting with a low contrast scan\" if you cannot change the scanners exposure???? most scanners automatically adjust exposure time, to achieve whatever brightness you ask for in the controls. at least any decent scanner. sometimes you can even hear the difference, with an extra dense original: stepstepstepstepstep becomes step-step-step-step-step as the scanner leaves the scanner ccd bar under each \"strip\" of the film for a longer exposure time. with a very rapid scanner, the steps are not as distinguishable, but the total scan times for a dense or thin original can be compared - 30 secs for a perfect \"normal\" slide or neg, vs. 25 secs for a thin original, and 40 secs for a dense original. with some of my old dense negs, my nikon, that scans a normal 35mm image in 30 secs. or so, can take up to 90 secs to allow time to \"penetrate\" the film's density. additionally, contrast comes from \"curves\" applied to the raw scan data, not exposure. a scanner will have a default curve that it can vary based on original image density and contrast, but can also be varied by user inputs. vuescan has curve controls, although they are not as \"intuitive\" as, say, adobe's, where one can just grab (many) points on the curve and drag them around. in vuescan, you have to adjust the output at the 25% and 75% points on the brightness scale, by numerical entries (e.g. set default 75% to \"65%\"), and move just those two points or values left or right to set a \"curve\" that connects 0%, the two adjustable points, and 100%, with various \"s\" or \"u\" or \"c\" shapes. or leave it \"linear\" - a straight line - output is 1:1 with input. _________________ my own scanning technique is this (vuescan on a film-capable flatbed). based on the wonderful fact that vuescan can output .dng files. processing the .dng as a \"raw\" file in acr is so much more flexible and easy and \"visual\" than most scanner adjustments. - i use vuescan's \"autolevels\" exposure mode, with clipping set to zero. default \"linear\" vuescan curve. output as 16-bit rgb .dng from a \"b&w negative.\" - i scan 6x6 negs with the black border included, and adjust \"exposure\" manually to give me as close to a pure black (\"0,0,0\") as possible in the blank areas outside the image area (film base plus fog). that can be anywhere from exposure 0.60 to exposure 1.00, depending on film type/base density/fog. but most of the time is just left at 0.7 or so.

Thank you Martin, I know and I've already do the procedure for digital negatives for my exhibition in the Rangefinder Gallery at Tamarkin Camera in Chicago, 15 of my pictures was made frrom Digital Negatives, size 8x12\" contact prints o Ilford FB paper, but I've not liked very much the system, the response of the curves is not the same, I have mesured with a densitometer the different areas and the extremes Zones 0 and I, and IX and X shall be avoid, even a little bit more. Consequently the negative has a shorter dynamic range, using PS % of reflections you can identify reflexion with zones and it is more easy to adjust, even so many of the negatives was made 2 or 3 times to adjust them on the good values. The second problem is that printers print points and don't translate with exactitude the greys gradation, finally you shall do a Negative for every size you want to print.

After having set up my existing enlargers for large format (4x5\") and small format negatives printing, I planned to use the 23C for medium format size negatives (6x7 cm) since I also had a Schneider-Kreuznach 80/5.6 enlarger lens. What I was missing is the fitting negative holder for 6x7 cm - I checked online and found a few horrendously expensive used negative holders (the new ones from Beseler were even more expensive). I checked in my clutter box where I kept other scavenged darkroom material, and I found an Omega-enlarger based 6x7 cm negative holder. Glad I didn't buy any of the overpriced Beseler ones - because actually the Omega one fits in portrait mode nicely into the 23C enlarger. Of course there is a little gap between closed upper bellow unit and the holder, but I found it is not an issue at all (no light leaks out to an extent that it would endanger the printing process during exposure). I didn't find it described online anywhere that Omega negative holders can be used in certain Beseler enlargers! The Schneider-Kreuznach 80/5.8 lens also handles the 6x7 cm negative size well with sharp corners when stopped down a bit (I normally use my enlarger lenses at f/11).

Not sure what you mean as \"speed loss\". The diluted amounts are quite normal in development processes and lead especially in the Xtol case to better highlight effects.

For me, that means that using routines or filters is essential for anyone interested in regular forum participation. As for the view count, I beg to differ, because I believe it can be an important and useful element in using LUF. One example, say you've started a thread and have only a few responses but see that there are a lot a views: you might get the thread moving by making a post to that effect. I've done that, and have seen other such \"reminder posts\" that get a thread moving with wider participation. The reverse is also true: if you see that your thread has little viewership then the game ain't worth the candle and you just give up on it.

In either case, low or high view count can be useful to know \u2014 but having to go and track down the view count for one's thread in the basic forum view is too cumbersome to do regularly.

Next week I'll make a big update to the forum software. We are moving from IPBoard version 3.4.9 to 4.3.6 - everyone with some software knowledge will recognize that this is a big step.

PHP version: The current version is based on a PHP version which runs out. Mobile version: The new version brings a much better mobile experience Features and usability: The new version brings a modern interface and great features making contributions much easier What to do\u2026 Stay calm and carry on.

More keepers with the digital and it isn't just that I am older and wiser. My hat is off to those of you who can work without that little screen.

After a few years, I bought into the S system which has spoiled me thoroughly. You get the look of M9 CCD files with a density of color, tonal range and depth that is seductive in a larger format. I made the move because, as a shooter of film MF and LF printed large, I was looking for a digital equivalent, which the S provides in spades. I have the 70mm which stay on my camera most of the time. It best reflects the way I see the world. Also the 35mm (a 28mm FF equivalent).Both are brilliant. Leica did its parsimonious customers a favor with its smart adapters for Contax and Hasselblad lenses. I bought the Zeiss 35mm, 120mm and 240mm with Mutar 1.4x , all for about $2500, The Contax 35mm is a splendid piece of glass and the equal to the Leica - not the same but an equivalent, though a stop slower. The 120mm macro ($800+/-) is just brilliant. I have no need to spend 4-5x more for the Leica version. The 240mm is OK but not up to its siblings. Still at about $250.... If not for the low light limitations, I would regard the 006 form factor as ideal. It feels just right in the hand - perfect in fact. The most form fitting body I have ever held - camera, that is. I like a big camera that does not feel like a big camera. That would be the S. Feels more natural than the M9 or Q even with the attached grip. Be advised that the S lenses have dodgy motor parts which can disable the AF. My 35mm crapped out and was repaired, gratis, in Germany and returned to me in the US within two weeks. My 70mm now needs the same attention. Problem is finding the right time to dispossess myself from it. And I have the split level screen which makes manual focusing a breeze, even for us glasses wearers. I could not be more enthusiastic about this camera, and most important, the images it makes. I just don't get it, frankly. The S 006 is simply the best deal on the used market that I have ever seen. Good luck with your choice - it is an embarrassment of riches.

It is relatively easy to unload the UR in the dark but not always so easy to correctly load the camera in the dark. I have done this for a few years now and put through my two URs over 160 rolls of film (usually 36 exposure) and know about this difficulty firsthand. Sometimes the film does not feed correctly and with this camera there is no rewind knob available to check that the film is feeding correctly. What I have learned to do is after loading the film, I wind a few frames onto the take up spool and feel the film feeding spool at the same time. If I feel the feeding spool move as I wind the film, I know that the film is moving through the camera correctly. I then screw the bottom plate onto the camera. I have learned to do this after taking at least 50 pictures and still there is no rattle when I shake the camera. I had this problem at the Leica gathering in Wetzlar and lost a number of important pictures. Luckily I had three URs with me and was able to get the pictures with them. I have also learned to always have my dark bag with me on long trips to check that the film is feeding correctly. I also wish to correct my prior statement about rewinding the film back into the cassette.

It is relatively easy to unload the UR in the dark but not always so easy to correctly load the camera in the dark. I have done this for a few years now and put through my two URs over 160 rolls of film (usually 36 exposure) and know about this difficulty firsthand. Sometimes the film does not feed correctly and with this camera there is no rewind knob available to check that the film is feeding correctly. What I have learned to do is after loading the film, I wind a few frames onto the take up spool and feel the film feeding spool at the same time. If I feel the feeding spool move as I wind the film, I know that the film is moving through the camera correctly. I then screw the bottom plate onto the camera. I have learned to do this after taking at least 50 pictures and still there is no rattle when I shake the camera. I had this problem at the Leica gathering in Wetzlar and lost a number of important pictures. Luckily I had three URs with me and was able to get the pictures with them. I have also learned to always have my dark bag with me on long trips to check that the film is feeding correctly. I also wish to correct my prior statement about rewinding the film back into the cassette.

George, As I mentioned in a post above, Igorcamera often has Tessina cassettes for sale.

Unlike other lenses I have tried where I was fiddling about with the various extension tubes to get focus (and usually failing), I could focus immediately with all three of the standard tubes in on the Componon and that gave perfect 1:1 reproduction with my SL. The other lens I tried with very similar results was a Rodenstock Rodagon 50/2,8. I could not tell which I had taken with the Rodagon apart from the focal length, which was slightly shorter than the Componon and as it was 2\u00bd times the price, I went with the Componon S. The only other comment I would make is that on Agfa Precisa reversal film, which is a warm rendering film to begin with (it has a pale brown warming substrate under the Fuji Provia emulsion), the rendition of the Componon is slightly over warm. I take my images on the BEOON with the SL at a fixed 5600\u00baK colour temperature, so it is easy enough to adjust the DNG's in PP. Wilson PS I had originally hoped that the Zeiss ZM Planar 50 would be a really good lens on the BEEON. I could not get it to work at all. It must be due to the position of its exit pupil. After having found the Componon, I see little point in experimenting further.
