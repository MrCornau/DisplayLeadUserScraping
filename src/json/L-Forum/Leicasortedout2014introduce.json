Describing this in terms of one component outresolving the other, while technically incorrect, gets the point across. Well, we ought to be much more careful with the language and first define the terms used. Statement 1: Lenses don't outresolve sensors, and sensors don't outresolve lenses. Statement 2: Better lenses are better on any sensor and better sensors are better behind any lens. When I use the term outresolve - a term that I introduced as OP in the first post, namely \"I am interested in quantitatively comparing the resolution of Leica lenses with the resolution of digital sensors. So, I would like to know how one can determine whether a given lens outresolves a given sensor and vice versa, or whether the resolution of lens and sensor are comparable.\" - I assumed that one can determine the resolution of a sensor and a lens, compare them and see which one is larger. For example the Sony sensor in the Nikon D800/E or Sony A7R has about 100 line pairs per mm (lppm) resolution, whereas the APO-R 280/4 has about 500 lppm. So, one clearly is larger than the other and I tried to characterize any such comparison by using the term outresolve. Of course, the fact that the sensor resolution is different from the lens resolution can have consequences. Furthermore, I do not see Statement 1 connected to Statement 2. These statements ought to be examined independently. Of course in Statement 1 I have no insight how 01af defines that term outresolves. In Statement 2 the term better is ambiguous and needs to be clearly defined. That statement deserves closer scrutiny with regards to its validity and limitations - after properly defining the term better first. So, I guess we may disagree.

Let me introduce ourself and tell a little story about us. Back in the nineties I moved to Berlin ( I really felt in love with the city) and established there my art studio. One year after I met a lovely japanese girl and we felt in love. She was an artist too and soon we started to collaborate in some art projects. We were both passionate about photography. At that time we had a Hasselblad and a Leica m6. We had a lot of fun taking photos together in such an amazing place at those exciting times. We got married and we moved to Japan. We lived with my wife\u00b4s parents. They own a farm in a beautiful place close to the sea. One of the buildings of the farm was empty and we set up there our studio. We spent two wonderful years there making art in a traditional japanese building in contact with really amazing people. Then we moved (again) to France. This time we chose a quiet valley in the Pyrenees. We rented a house to a lovely old lady who was our neighbor. She taught us french cooking and we spent together beautiful nights close to the chimney. Now we live in Madrid in an old house who belonged to a spanish painter. It has a splendid studio with incredible light. The passion about photography is still there. The Hassy too is still there. I love making art but lately I had to spend a lot of time in the studio and I felt I was missing contact with people. So we decided to start a street photo project. Now after working in the studio I go out with my Monochrome and summilux 35 mm. Every time I meet different people and besides the amazing files from the MM I can enjoy conversations and social interaction. Therefore this new activity got me even more hooked on photography. My apologies for my poor english and I hope I can learn a lot from the members of this forum.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/224912-greetings-from-madrid/?tab=comments#comment-2564988", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "224912-greetings-from-madrid", "result": true, "Selector": "me introduce", "selectorShort": "introduce", "MarkedSent": " hallo to everyone, we are a contemporary artist couple living in madrid. let -----> me !!!  -----> introduce !!!  ourself and tell a little story about us. back in the nineties i moved to berlin ( i really felt in love with the city) and established there my art studio. one year after i met a lovely japanese girl and we felt in love. she was an artist too and soon we started to collaborate in some art projects. we were both passionate about photography. at that time we had a hasselblad and a leica m6. we had a lot of fun taking photos together in such an amazing place at those exciting times. we got married and we moved to japan. we lived with my wife\u00b4s parents. they own a farm in a beautiful place close to the sea. one of the buildings of the farm was empty and we set up there our studio. we spent two wonderful years there making art in a traditional japanese building in contact with really amazing people. then we moved (again) to france. this time we chose a quiet valley in the pyrenees. we rented a house to a lovely old lady who was our neighbor. she taught us french cooking and we spent together beautiful nights close to the chimney. now we live in madrid in an old house who belonged to a spanish painter. it has a splendid studio with incredible light. the passion about photography is still there. the hassy too is still there. i love making art but lately i had to spend a lot of time in the studio and i felt i was missing contact with people. so we decided to start a street photo project. now after working in the studio i go out with my monochrome and summilux 35 mm. every time i meet different people and besides the amazing files from the mm i can enjoy conversations and social interaction. therefore this new activity got me even more hooked on photography. my apologies for my poor english and i hope i can learn a lot from the members of this forum.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 115382, "year": "2014"}, {"autor": "rgeorge911", "date": "2014-09-09 19:24:00", "content": " Hi All, I'm Reed, and I thought I'd introduce two other LHSA social networking sites (in addition to this forum and lhsa.org web page) (LHSA - The International Leica Society - Home) First, we have the LHSA Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/leica.society?ref=ts&fref=ts Second, the LHSA Google+ community (200 members): https://plus.google.com/app/basic/communities/117710662564340206713?cbp=1rgsbs0rywcrb&sview=59&cid=5&soc-app=115&soc-platform=1&spath=%2Fapp%2Fbasic%2Fcommunities&sparm=cbp%3Dg203z4yy3doe%26sview%3D2%26cid%3D5%26soc-app%3D115%26soc-platform%3D1 Please read, contribute, and enjoy all of these options for sharing the Leica experience!
