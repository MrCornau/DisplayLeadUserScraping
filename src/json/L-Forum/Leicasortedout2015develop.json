Instead, I'd like to know which do you like better? Sorry, I must have exhausted you with my comment. I simply didn't want to fuel the fire over the CCD vs. CMOS debate, simply state that I do see a difference. And I do see a difference in a tiny little degraded JPEG posted online viewed on my laptop. I would certainly see it on the original file on my calibrated Eizo display. So since you want to know what that perceived difference is for me, here it goes: the bottom photograph looks more flat, the mid tones are less separated, so solid objects are not as clearly differentiated from each other (branches to sky, grass from the curb, side of the curb from top of curb etc.). There is a steeper contrast curve in the mid tones in the top photograph (film has an even steeper mid tone curve). The bottom photograph looks more linear in contrast. You could try to apply \"clarity\" in LR, which does look more artificial though. So for this reason, I like the top photograph better. But the difference is subtle, so if I didn't have a direct comparison, I could live with either one. the reason I chose not to get the M240 is that not knowing which photographs I was working with, I was applying a lot more tweaking to the M240 files than the M9 files. This may be due to a preference I have developed over many years of using the M9. So I hope I didn't exhaust you even more with this answer, but I prefer the top image, and I don't care which camera it was made with.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/240288-400-leica-photographers-agree-we-love-ccd/page/3/?tab=comments#comment-2754557", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "240288-400-leica-photographers-agree-we-love-ccd", "result": true, "Selector": "i have developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "sigh. i didn't ask to you say which picture came from which camera. instead, i'd like to know which do you like better? sorry, i must have exhausted you with my comment. i simply didn't want to fuel the fire over the ccd vs. cmos debate, simply state that i do see a difference. and i do see a difference in a tiny little degraded jpeg posted online viewed on my laptop. i would certainly see it on the original file on my calibrated eizo display. so since you want to know what that perceived difference is for me, here it goes: the bottom photograph looks more flat, the mid tones are less separated, so solid objects are not as clearly differentiated from each other (branches to sky, grass from the curb, side of the curb from top of curb etc.). there is a steeper contrast curve in the mid tones in the top photograph (film has an even steeper mid tone curve). the bottom photograph looks more linear in contrast. you could try to apply \"clarity\" in lr, which does look more artificial though. so for this reason, i like the top photograph better. but the difference is subtle, so if i didn't have a direct comparison, i could live with either one. the reason i chose not to get the m240 is that not knowing which photographs i was working with, i was applying a lot more tweaking to the m240 files than the m9 files. this may be due to a preference -----> i !!!  -----> have !!!  -----> developed !!!  over many years of using the m9. so i hope i didn't exhaust you even more with this answer, but i prefer the top image, and i don't care which camera it was made with.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 39340, "year": "2015"}, {"autor": "Doc Henry", "date": "2015-06-12 12:47:00", "content": "Dave , just to tell you I develop in my home lab pictures on Ilford paper (silver) and I appreciate with great pleasure enlargement of some mountain landscapes pictures I shot recently ... some pictures are better reproduced in paper than in scanner (for posting in Leica Forum) specially for the deep black http://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/205842-i-like-filmopen-thread/?p=2830703 I enjoy my Focomat enlarger versus inkjet printer through my computer.The \"silver\" paper gives an undeniable plus and without appeal to the images printed on inkjet , really sharper and with deep black and gray scale Best Henry Edited June 12, 2015 by Doc Henry", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/245097-irwin-puts-on-film-vs-digital-and-printing/?tab=comments#comment-2833087", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "245097-irwin-puts-on-film-vs-digital-and-printing", "result": true, "Selector": "i develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "dave , just to tell you -----> i !!!  -----> develop !!!  in my home lab pictures on ilford paper (silver) and -----> i !!!  appreciate with great pleasure enlargement of some mountain landscapes pictures -----> i !!!  shot recently ... some pictures are better reproduced in paper than in scanner (for posting in leica forum) specially for the deep black http://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/205842-i-like-filmopen-thread/?p=2830703 i enjoy my focomat enlarger versus inkjet printer through my computer.the \"silver\" paper gives an undeniable plus and without appeal to the images printed on inkjet , really sharper and with deep black and gray scale best henry edited june 12, 2015 by doc henry", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 93863, "year": "2015"}, {"autor": "pico", "date": "2015-09-17 14:13:00", "content": "In small tanks, stand development is complete at ~40 minutes.

I have read of people actually removing the lens coatings from their lens front element due to obsessive over-cleaning. That does not help your image quality, even if your front & rear lens elements are surgically sterile. My usual lens cleaning regimen is to use a Giotto rocket blower bulb to blow dust off my front element. This usually is sufficient. If I have a stubborn dust particle, I will knock it loose with a horse hair lens brush and then use the blower. Once in a great while, I will get a rain drop on my front element that dries and leaves a water spot. for this, I use a microfiber cloth with photographic lens cleaner spray applied to the cloth. My two microfiber cloths that I use on my M lenses are stored in a ziplock bag and are used only on my camera lenses. I have a second lens cloth that I carry in my pocket, which is for cleaning my glasses. This cloth is never used on a camera lens. I wash my camera lens cleaning cloths by hand using a bit of laundry detergent in a clean bowl, rinse multiple times, then wring them out and hang them on a plastic coat hanger to air dry in a dust free area, just the same as if I were hanging just developed rolls of film to dry. Of course, the wash and rinse water is either distilled water or purified bottled drinking water. Maybe I'm a bit obsessive with the cloths I use on my megadollar Leica M lenses, but then again I have never scratched a lens element by careless cleaning. --img--  I have not used a UV filter for lens protection until I began experimenting with this practice very recently. If I discover that a high quality UV filter like B+W or Heliopan does not degrade image quality, I may begin shooting with UV filters on my lenses all the time. At present, I only put a UV filter on a lens if I am photographing in a very windy, dry & dusty place where dirt and dust are in the air, or in a situation where I am in very close proximity to people, as in photographing at an event like a music festival, sports event, etc. I have never had a lens front element damaged due to not using a UV filter in 35+ years of photography.

As loading to the wireless drive takes place, review the shots via iPad wirelessly using the WD app Shortlist candidates as usual by electing to \"Open in Photos\", which will launch the camera roll so that the JPEG will be saved Likewise, if I would like to develop any of the candidate shots, open the DNG in PhotoGene This allows me to achieve 2 more capabilities: Reduce the time-to-load dramatically by not loading the candidates to the iPad camera roll, and Make backups at the same time. But that's the \"theory\". Will post the reality findings next week.

Also, if I always develop 2 rolls at once....if I develop 1 roll do I have to use half of the solutions or can I stick to the normal 600ml? The dilution mistake should produce lower contrast negatives - but not nothing. For the quantity, your instructions from the tank should tell you how much developer you need for 1 roll. Or just test it out with empty reels. Philipp's point is worth considering - if you use 1/2 the developer and by mistake put the sigle roll of film in the top of the tank, you will certainly have problems. As you agitate during development, some solution will get onto the film, but the effect would be difficult to predict. Not only the developer, but the fixer. But you clearly are making some variety of mistake - developing 1 roll in a 2 roll tank is no problem, and there should be no tricks. Common sense rules.
