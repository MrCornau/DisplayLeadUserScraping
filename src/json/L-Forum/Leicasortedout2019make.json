Yesterday I visited Sony's product presentation at a Munich camera store. My girl friend was looking for a replacement of her heavy Canon 5D Mkii.

I agree. Best of both worlds and two very unique and complementary shooting experiences and tools. The very good thing about Leica prices is they FORCE me to make Leica purchasing decisions very carefully and very slowly. The M10 is already such a great Rangefinder, I can wait some time for the right financial opportunity to come along. Personally, I have a few questions about the M10-P conversion program and waiting to hear back from OP and other people's experiences. For, instance, I would not be keen to allow Leica to keep the old very valuable M10 parts unless they gave me a significant credit toward the conversion price. Or some other form of payment. Also, when might the next gen M camera come along? I'm just learning the Leica way with all these intermediary features added to base M10 but not sure when to expect a new model and wouldn't want to go with the M10-P or the conversion if the next gen is on the horizon.

If you remember your other post on your projects (in Barnack's), I like them very much. In the Don McCullin video you posted, one of the significant features of his picture-process is that he engages with his subjects almost every time. They instantly cease to be anonymous, even if we don't always learn their names. I apologize that the pix below are not Leica (albeit rangefinder, Mamiya 6, made a couple of weeks ago) - Like McCullin, I shoot film in medium-format these days, and that is what I was using on this day. (By very odd coincidence, this series was taken about 30 meters from my previous-page 2007 PrideFest series). Also like McCullin, I try to engage with my subjects. I spent 10 minutes sitting on the sidewalk talking with Brandy face-to-face, learning how she came to be in Denver, what her life has been like, found out she was an activist fighting aganst Denver's \"urban camping ban\" (a bureaucratic attempt to drive the homeless off the streets at night). But I'll let her tell some of it in her own words (see below pictures). In the case of a project, the occasional anonymous picture absorbs context from the rest of the project. We learn something about the faceless person outside the Arndale Centre because you photographed him(?), and because (s)he is included in your project on the dispossesed (otherwise, frankly, (s)he could be a hung-over college student). It was famously said that the difference between Cartier-Bresson's pictures and Gene Smith's pictures was that in C-B's pictures we learn a lot about \"the human condition at large\" while in Smith's we learn a lot about the actual person in the picture. As with most such generalizations, that's wrong about half the time, but it still illustrates a certain dichotomy in reportage work. Personally, I like to break the class stereotype of \"the masses\" precisely by forcing the viewer to encounter each one as a complete individual with a story, not as just a symbol. It's harder to ignore a three-dimensional person than it is to ignore a faceless \"them.\" Meeting Brandy, the McCullin video, this thread in general, and your own projects have all combined to make me think about how I can expand her story into a more complete project (or several). So many subjects, so little time.... --img--  \"No, I can't play this (ukelele). I'm trying to learn though. It was given to me by the wife of a friend of mine - he got killed when he was pushed off a freight car in a fight. It reminds me of him, so I keep it. We knew each other for years on the roads. I grew up in Florida - I've been in Denver a couple of years. Mostly I stay with friends I make - I don't like the shelters. I'd rather do my own thing. I like the streets; there's more freedom, but with this camping ban, it makes it hard to be free. That's why I'm helping fight it.

(by very odd coincidence, this series was taken about 30 meters from my previous-page 2007 pridefest series). also like mccullin, i try to engage with my subjects. i spent 10 minutes sitting on the sidewalk talking with brandy face-to-face, learning how she came to be in denver, what her life has been like, found out she was an activist fighting aganst denver's \"urban camping ban\" (a bureaucratic attempt to drive the homeless off the streets at night). but i'll let her tell some of it in her own words (see below pictures). in the case of a project, the occasional anonymous picture absorbs context from the rest of the project. we learn something about the faceless person outside the arndale centre because you photographed him(?), and because (s)he is included in your project on the dispossesed (otherwise, frankly, (s)he could be a hung-over college student). it was famously said that the difference between cartier-bresson's pictures and gene smith's pictures was that in c-b's pictures we learn a lot about \"the human condition at large\" while in smith's we learn a lot about the actual person in the picture. as with most such generalizations, that's wrong about half the time, but it still illustrates a certain dichotomy in reportage work. personally, i like to break the class stereotype of \"the masses\" precisely by forcing the viewer to encounter each one as a complete individual with a story, not as just a symbol. it's harder to ignore a three-dimensional person than it is to ignore a faceless \"them.\" meeting brandy, the mccullin video, this thread in general, and your own projects have all combined to make me think about how i can expand her story into a more complete project (or several). so many subjects, so little time.... --img--  \"no, i can't play this (ukelele). i'm trying to learn though. it was given to me by the wife of a friend of mine - he got killed when he was pushed off a freight car in a fight. it reminds me of him, so i keep it. we knew each other for years on the roads. i grew up in florida - i've been in denver a couple of years. mostly -----> i !!!  stay with friends -----> i !!!  -----> make !!!  - -----> i !!!  don't like the shelters. i'd rather do my own thing. i like the streets; there's more freedom, but with this camping ban, it makes it hard to be free. that's why i'm helping fight it. the worst thing on the streets is the drugs - the fentanyl, the amphetamines. i've have lost maybe thirty friends to drugs - thirty people (long pause) thirty people, i can't believe it sometimes! i just can't believe it.... my name? brandy.....\" edited october 27, 2019 by adan", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 18972, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "250swb", "date": "2019-10-28 10:34:00", "content": "16 hours ago, adan said: --img--  \"No, I can't play this (ukelele).

The point where reality changes is often very subtle and I think your caption points very much to positively adding to reality and the angst displayed by the subject.

Most people take it that the boy has been wound up by Arbus to the point of extreme frustration and anger by the expression on his face.

It captures photons of light and outputs an analogous number of electrons, which are read out as a charge (CCD) or a voltage (CMOS). Those are measured to produce the brightness values assigned to each pixel of the image. It doesn't matter what ISO is set - the sensor puts out a constant value of electrons based on the inflow of photons received per pixel. 1 photon = 1 electron (more or less) regardless of whether the ISO is set to 200 or 6400. 3) There is (generally speaking) no way to force the sensor to put out a different value - it can't be \"amped up\" with more or less power, for example. But the identical signal it puts out at ISO 200 or ISO 6400 can be \"amped up\" farther down the digital imaging chain. 4) When you change the ISO on a digital camera, you are doing two things: 4A) you are telling the camera processing electronics (not the sensor) to amplify the signal after exposure. Not unlike push-processing film - the weak signal gets multiplied after the fact to produce more brightness than the exposure would normally produce at \"box speed\" (or \"base ISO\"). And 4B ) you are telling the metering system to compensate for that amplification (which in turn tells you reduce the exposure via shutter and aperture). As jkcampbell2's example shows, there is not much difference between the camera amplifying the signal (by setting the ISO dial to 3200) or the photographer amplifying the signal in Photoshop/ACR/LR later on. It's all just computer math - a brightest pixel value of 15 gets multiplied 2^4x (16x) to 240, along with a certain loss of quality (grain with film, noise with a digital signal). However..... 1 hour ago, jaapv said: Yes, and the point is that cranking up the ISO doesn\u2019t alter the exposure (amount of light falling on the sensor). To do that you must change the only the two exposure parameters: shutter time and aperture. ...or use a neutral density or other filter. Or add light to the scene, with anything from car headlights to a flash to a full Hollywood lighting setup. Or simply chose a brighter or darker scene to begin with. All of those also determine the amount of light falling on the sensor or film. There are not \"only two exposure parameters\" - and never really have been. Box Brownies and similar came with a fixed shutter speed (\"Instantaneous\" - somewhere around 1/30th sec). Many came with a fixed aperture (f/11 or so). About the only thing you could change was the ISO used - generally something in the ISO 125 range like Verichrome Pan, but eventually faster (and slower) films. Nevertheless, billions of family snapshots were made with such devices. The fact that one can get a \"bad exposure\" by using the wrong ISO, or the wrong filter - just as easily as using the wrong shutter speed or aperture - shows that ISO is just as much a determinant of correct exposure as the others. Exposure is not just the amount of light falling on the sensor - it is the correct final range of tones in the finished picture. I want to make a picture. I want to use a specific shutter speed (for motion control, not just exposure and amount of light). I want to use a specific aperture (for DoF control, not just exposure and amount of light). ISO becomes another variable I can use, just like changing the lighting, or adding an ND filter, to make the exposure correct. I can walk around all day with a camera set to a fixed ISO (with film cameras, I have to). And vary the aperture and shutter speed to get a correct exposure. Or set the camera to \"A\" and let it vary the shutter speed (with a fixed aperture - the old photojournalists' mantra, \"f/5.6 and be there\"). But these days, I can also walk around all day with a camera set to a fixed aperture and shutter speed (say, f/4 and 1/2000th sec.). And let the camera automatically vary the ISO to get correct exposures everywhere I go. ISO has a more limited range (8 stops with the M10 Auto ISO, from 200 to 50000), while using auto-shutter gives me at least 12 stops (1/4000-1 sec) and 19 stops if I use shutter and aperture together. But that's just a question of degree - doesn't change the underlying principle.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/300975-iso-woes/page/4/?tab=comments#comment-3819568", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "300975-iso-woes", "result": true, "Selector": "i want to make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "1) it looks like we scared off the original poster - we still don't know what his \"iso woes\" were. 2) a digital sensor is a pretty simple analog device. it captures photons of light and outputs an analogous number of electrons, which are read out as a charge (ccd) or a voltage (cmos). those are measured to produce the brightness values assigned to each pixel of the image. it doesn't matter what iso is set - the sensor puts out a constant value of electrons based on the inflow of photons received per pixel. 1 photon = 1 electron (more or less) regardless of whether the iso is set to 200 or 6400. 3) there is (generally speaking) no way to force the sensor to put out a different value - it can't be \"amped up\" with more or less power, for example. but the identical signal it puts out at iso 200 or iso 6400 can be \"amped up\" farther down the digital imaging chain. 4) when you change the iso on a digital camera, you are doing two things: 4a) you are telling the camera processing electronics (not the sensor) to amplify the signal after exposure. not unlike push-processing film - the weak signal gets multiplied after the fact to produce more brightness than the exposure would normally produce at \"box speed\" (or \"base iso\"). and 4b ) you are telling the metering system to compensate for that amplification (which in turn tells you reduce the exposure via shutter and aperture). as jkcampbell2's example shows, there is not much difference between the camera amplifying the signal (by setting the iso dial to 3200) or the photographer amplifying the signal in photoshop/acr/lr later on. it's all just computer math - a brightest pixel value of 15 gets multiplied 2^4x (16x) to 240, along with a certain loss of quality (grain with film, noise with a digital signal). however..... 1 hour ago, jaapv said: yes, and the point is that cranking up the iso doesn\u2019t alter the exposure (amount of light falling on the sensor). to do that you must change the only the two exposure parameters: shutter time and aperture. ...or use a neutral density or other filter. or add light to the scene, with anything from car headlights to a flash to a full hollywood lighting setup. or simply chose a brighter or darker scene to begin with. all of those also determine the amount of light falling on the sensor or film. there are not \"only two exposure parameters\" - and never really have been. box brownies and similar came with a fixed shutter speed (\"instantaneous\" - somewhere around 1/30th sec). many came with a fixed aperture (f/11 or so). about the only thing you could change was the iso used - generally something in the iso 125 range like verichrome pan, but eventually faster (and slower) films. nevertheless, billions of family snapshots were made with such devices. the fact that one can get a \"bad exposure\" by using the wrong iso, or the wrong filter - just as easily as using the wrong shutter speed or aperture - shows that iso is just as much a determinant of correct exposure as the others. exposure is not just the amount of light falling on the sensor - it is the correct final range of tones in the finished picture. -----> i !!!  -----> want !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> make !!!  a picture. i want to use a specific shutter speed (for motion control, not just exposure and amount of light). i want to use a specific aperture (for dof control, not just exposure and amount of light). iso becomes another variable i can use, just like changing the lighting, or adding an nd filter, to make the exposure correct. i can walk around all day with a camera set to a fixed iso (with film cameras, i have to). and vary the aperture and shutter speed to get a correct exposure. or set the camera to \"a\" and let it vary the shutter speed (with a fixed aperture - the old photojournalists' mantra, \"f/5.6 and be there\"). but these days, i can also walk around all day with a camera set to a fixed aperture and shutter speed (say, f/4 and 1/2000th sec.). and let the camera automatically vary the iso to get correct exposures everywhere i go. iso has a more limited range (8 stops with the m10 auto iso, from 200 to 50000), while using auto-shutter gives me at least 12 stops (1/4000-1 sec) and 19 stops if i use shutter and aperture together. but that's just a question of degree - doesn't change the underlying principle.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 19409, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Gibbo", "date": "2019-04-24 17:56:00", "content": "My M240 needs recalibrating.

Forty years ago I would have been accompanied by a lensman, but in today's world the man with the notebook is expected to take his own pics. That orange-jacket photo showed a potential future nightmare - the presidents of Boeing and Scruggs Airways pose in front of the Boeing 767 at next month's Paris Air Show to announce an order to 50 aircraft, and decide to do this wearing orange high-vis jackets with the Boeing (or Scruggs) logo. All the other journalists get a useable photo (just as the other photographers on last week's outing seem to have had no problem with the orange jacket), but I get one that makes it look like the poor guys had been attacked by yellow-paint-wielding protestors. That's the sort of misfortune that would earn this poor freelance the sort of interview with a magazine editor in which coffee is not served. Back in the film era, I would load my camera with whatever seemed the best film for the job, and my only decision on image processing was whether to get this done by Joe's Basement or Metro Imaging. (I preferred Metro because when I went to buy film, the counter staff could advise of the best emulsion to use for the task in hand - told that I heading off to an event organised by the Israeli ministry of defence, they regaled me with a sad tale of how an expensive fashion shoot in the Egyptian desert needed to be entirely restaged some weeks later using a different film type because the colour balance from the first attempt had been uncorrectably cool.) In today's digital age, shooting in JPEG and relying on the camera get the exposure and colour-balance reasonably right is the basic modus operandi for a journalist, and this way of working has rather influenced my 'off-duty' approach to digital photography. Sergei Gorshkov, commander in chief of the Soviet Navy from 1956 to 1985, is reported to have a plaque on the wall of his office that read \"Better is the enemy of good enough\". Following this maxim, I set my M9, Digilux 3 and D-Lux Typ 109 cameras to produce both JPEG and raw files. Wherever possible I treat the JPEG as a ready-to-use 'good enough' image, leaving the raw file as the 'In case of emergency, break the glass' solution for photos that need significant manipulation. The 'as shot' white balance from the camera is almost invariably better the 'auto' version that the software offers. If this white balance is unacceptable, the only correction I normally make would be to 'pick' on something that is neutral or near-neutral - as a journalist it was often relatively easy to make sure than a piece of white paper or even my black-covered reporter's notebook had been included in the photo. With the Leica M-D, there is no JPEG output, so Capture One and RawTherapee have become the equivalent of Joe's Basement and Metro Imaging - I use Irfanview to scan through the raw files and delete the obvious failures, then pass the others through one of these programs in order to generate JPEG versions. If one program has problems with one or more specific pics, the other will probably do a better job. Perhaps I'm a bit of a digital philistine, but the reason that I moved to the M-D was the desire to escape from modes and menus, and return to the simplicity of film-era shooting. So I must confess to having as much desire to explore the many 'bells & whistles' of Capture One or RawTherapee (curves, tints, et al,) as I have of learning how to operate an E-6 processing machine. I've posted below the results of running the orange-jacket pic through RawTherapee, and making some initial corrections. The software has made a reasonable job of rendering the overexposed jacket and the burned-out hand, but the whites (such as the woman's shoes) show some magenta contamination. So the pic still needs some further work. The blacks are still not zero, reflecting the fact that in the real world, the darkest tones are rarely pure black. --img-- ", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/297417-out-of-gamut-problem-with-an-m-d-image/?tab=comments#comment-3744655", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "297417-out-of-gamut-problem-with-an-m-d-image", "result": true, "Selector": "i should have made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "as i said yesterday, the image i posted was not intended to be a corrected version, but to show the 'yellow-paint' problem as seen in the out-of-the-camera image. so the exposure had been only roughly corrected, and no attempt was made to set the optimum white balance. -----> i !!!  -----> should !!!  -----> have !!!  -----> made !!!  this clear in my original posting. i didn't upload the original dng because our forum has a file size limitation. i curious as to why this false yellow colour had been generated. hours of experimentation with capture one have shown that it could not be removed by changing the exposure, camera profile, or colour balance. i'm a journalist. forty years ago i would have been accompanied by a lensman, but in today's world the man with the notebook is expected to take his own pics. that orange-jacket photo showed a potential future nightmare - the presidents of boeing and scruggs airways pose in front of the boeing 767 at next month's paris air show to announce an order to 50 aircraft, and decide to do this wearing orange high-vis jackets with the boeing (or scruggs) logo. all the other journalists get a useable photo (just as the other photographers on last week's outing seem to have had no problem with the orange jacket), but i get one that makes it look like the poor guys had been attacked by yellow-paint-wielding protestors. that's the sort of misfortune that would earn this poor freelance the sort of interview with a magazine editor in which coffee is not served. back in the film era, i would load my camera with whatever seemed the best film for the job, and my only decision on image processing was whether to get this done by joe's basement or metro imaging.

I'm kind of used to it now. The files it puts out make it all worthwhile. I'll keep using that camera for as long as I can. An M10 Monochrom however, with better reliability, better handling, thinner body shell, faster speed, vastly improved viewfinder, LCD, battery life, and shutter sound, plus a 41MP sensor.

Then again I should imagine you have your own personal team of gnomes from Solms following you around with a shiny Leica support van, re-setting your bodies like a tennis pro has rackets tensioned ? No? --img--  I know this is not for everyone and that's not what I'm saying - my aim in posting is to share the work I have done and the successes I have had with my own adjustments. It is very nice to know how to tweak one's own camera very quickly if necessary. It is nice to remove the 'aura' from the rangefinder mechanism in one's own mind and kind of feel at one with it. That's all. So Jamie - this is the explanation I posted a little while back along with a couple of pics for you to look at. As adil says you need to take a sample of shots from every lens (and body if possible) you have to make sure you're calibrating it right. You will need a 2.5mm allen key and a small screwdriver which you should grind a very slight angle on so that as you fit the screwdriver into the head on the focus throw pivot (A) on the diagram it allows a nice flat drive. A) is the focus throw adjustment. If you look at the pic you can see that the screw retains an eccentric cam. If you loosen the screw you can rotate the cam (as denoted by the pink and blue arrows) freely. As you do so, the length of the arm itself changes. By moving the cam counter-clockwise (as in pink arrow) you INCREASE the total available focus throw. By moving the cam clockwise (as in blue arrow) you DECREASE the total available focus throw. --img--  is the infinity adjustment as we know. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key counter clockwise (as in green arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity further away - and this 'references everything forward of that. If you rotate the 2.5mm hex key clockwise (as in yellow arrow) you move the point at which the rangefinder 'sees' infinity closer to you - and this 'references everything forward of that. Right - so they are the two adjustments you have available to you. From my playing about the best way to set it up is this. 1) Infinity is very important. Step 1 is to look at something with lots of contrast a long way off (a star does seem to work very well but today I've been using a clock tower in the far distance and that's fine too) and then adjust the roller (--img--  so that this perfectly coincides. Don't accept the nonesense I was spouting before about it not mattering. It really matters that you can 100% converge the object at infinity. 2) Now, take a photo at a big aperture of something close to you - like 0.8 meters or similar. I found text to be excellent. Note whether you now have front focus or back focus. If you have front focus (like I did - big time!) then your focus throw is too short; ie your arm is too long, so when the lens rotates you're not pushing the rangefinder enough. So you need to shorten the arm by loosening (A) and twisting the cam slightly anti-clockwise. (If you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) Now, recheck infinity. It will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. But this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) Repeat step 2. You will see that the focus point has altered. Whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general I made positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) When you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. On my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) I did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. When my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range.

(if you have backfocus then it's obviously the inverse and you need to go clockwise to lengthen the arm and reduce your focus throw). 3) now, recheck infinity. it will now be wrong, because you have now moved the arm and so the roller wheel has also moved. but this is not a problem - just recorrect infinity as in 1) above to compensate for the altered focus throw. 4) repeat step 2. you will see that the focus point has altered. whether it has moved too little or too much will calibrate your hand/eye as to how much you need to make the adjustments but in general -----> i !!!  -----> made !!!  positive, but not excessive tweaks each time. 5) when you are happy with the infinity and close settings you want to shoot some images off that are at various distances just to make sure that everything is right. on my setup which consists of all current model lenses (not sure if this is relevent) i did not have to compensate with any kind of compromise here. when my infinity setting is right and the focus throw is perfect the transgression from near to far is linear and my lenses are sharp right the way through the range. i suppose that if this were not the case or if your lenses varied then you'd need to get them recalibrated, or maybe accept a compromise setting. hope that's helpful. have fun --img--  --img--  thank you for detailed info, after weeks of googling, i find this post very helpful i'm using 262 for a year and starting to notice at infinity focus the building which is like 5-6 km away (focus at infinity) has a little separation this image before & after some very slightly adjustment on the roller b will translate this into thais and share with some folks if you have a green light --img-- /applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png\"> salute --img--  edited march 25, 2019 by natnbook edit the images", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 30906, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "rivi1969", "date": "2019-09-12 16:47:00", "content": "16 hours ago, Charadis said: Ze package iz on ze vay --img--  --img--  Good to now your camera finally will arrive today, I haven't even heard from this guy yet and I made the bank transfer last Thursday, I am starting to regret getting into all this business.

Just to give some background about myself as I am new to Leica forum. I am from Malaysia, which to me, this is a place that every difficult to find a good condition Leica, even there is, the price will be sky high. For my understanding, the only better place to look for used camera in Asia is Japan although their price are not cheap, but at least they are honest enough to explain the condition of the camera before we can make purchase decision. However, if you can provide a better place that I can obtain a Leica at reasonable price and that online shop is reliable and willing to offer international shipping, I am totally find with it. I have been shooting DSLR for 10 years, and started with digital, currently (still) shooting with Canon EOS 1D Mark IV, 6D and owned few good glass such as 16-35mm f/4, 70-200mm f/2.8, 24-105 f/4 and few primes. Photography is just my hobby, and mainly in street photography and travel photography. For the gears I owned, I think I can shoot fast if I want, but I wish to experience the Leica rangefinder camera, and I noticed that, this is not a \"run-and-gun\" camera. Camera is just a tool for me to take picture, a better camera won't help for me to take good picture! The experience is important to me, I believe the Leica should able to bring a very good experience to enjoy the photography. From the Map Camera, a GOOD used M9 cost around usd4,800, a good M240 is around USD5,050 which even cheaper than a M9-P, and an used M10 cost around USD6,300.

I'm new to M-mount lenses and have been shooting them on my Nikon Z6 and Z7 cameras by way of a Yeenon branded adapter (with helicoid). I'm shooting primarily Cosina Voigtlander stuff (21/1.8, 35/1.7, 40/1.4 SC, 50/1.5) and a few old L39 Nikkors. I've just begun experimenting with ND filters on these lenses and was totally perplexed when I began seeing some light leaks appearing in my images. My first thought was the adapter. While I wasn't using the close-focusing mechanism, a built-in helicoid that extends the lens a bit further and significantly decreases the minimum focusing distance, I thought perhaps that was coming into play. More moving parts, more gaps, more chance of light making it through. Furthermore, the CV 35/1.7, the lens I was using at the time, and the Yeenon adapter are chrome plated brass. Tons of reflective surfaces all around. Maybe light was reflecting off of the sensor glass, onto the back of the adapter and lens, and then back to the sensor again? This thread however, gives me great relief on one hand, that I'm not alone. But also frustrates me that the mount can allow for this. I have yet to test the hairband solution, though having read through this, I anticipate it will prove the point. I will be sure to update after I test it, for further reinforcement.

I get what your saying about the Leicas being based on a design that has produced cameras that has outlived and out-performed most of its contemporaries. What a beautiful deigned camera that has stood the test of time. And that\u2019s what made me decide to buy the M-A. And I also get what your saying about a camera designed back in the 1920s, might have been technologically advanced then but the same design may may throw up a few quirks compared to a \u2018modern\u2019 designed camera. The problem is not in the M-A having narrower spacings between the frames of the negatives, which is far smaller in width compared to the M7, but more importantly it is the inconsistency of the spacings where the spacings vsry significantly in width. There does not appear to be a common pattern where this occurs. It can occur anywhere on the negatives. I will continue to use the M-A and see if it \u201cgrows\u201d out if this problem. But I doubt it, as I adopted the same approach with the first M-A and it continued with the same problem. But thank you again for you thoughts and comments. It is much appreciated.

For the last trip I had the 1dx and the 5DSr with me. Both lenses (100-400mm and the 2.8/300mm) have been the Mark II versions. As I might to go back to Africa next year, I asked myself what gear to take with me. So I made a simple experiment in the garden. My target was to get a reasonable sharp picture on an 27\u00b4\u00b4 5k iMac with crop that would get from an 800mm lens without cropping. In the race was: Leica SL with the 90-280mm 5DSr with the 100-400mm II 5DSr with the 2.8/300mm II with 2*converter 5DSr with the Tamron 150-600mm All lensed shot wide open from a tripod. The Leica picture was not really acceptable, because I had to crop it down to 4MPx. The Tamron was okay, but took no advantage from the 600mm. The winner was the 5DSr with the 100-400mm. The 2.8/300mm was close (this combo needs to be stopped down). The reason to tell this is that a high resolution sensor with an excellent lens allows to have less weight with you.

I wanted to make a photograph of the memorial there to see how the ultrawide lens would work, but I couldn't help a little beauty shot of my bicycle parked on the corner. --img--  Now this next is really what I stopped for: I've often tried to get a good photograph of the memorial but it's difficult because the ideal place to stand is right in the middle of a busy intersection. The ultrawide lens allowed me to be closer and still capture the whole thing, albeit not with my usual square crop but with the full format, then crop to a long 16:9 proportion.

This Executive Order led to the forced removal and incarceration of some 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast, who had to abandon their jobs, their homes, and their lives to be sent to one of ten concentration camps scattered in desolate, remote regions of the country. No Japanese Americans were ever charged, much less convicted, of espionage or sabotage against the United States. Yet they were targeted, rounded up, and imprisoned for years, simply for having the \"face of the enemy.\" Every February, the Japanese American community commemorates Executive Order 9066 as a reminder of the impact the incarceration experience has had on our families, our community, and our country. It is an opportunity to educate others on the fragility of civil liberties in times of crisis, and the importance of remaining vigilant in protecting the rights and freedoms of all. This has some personal significance to me: One of my good friends from college days spent some twenty-plus years of her life working with the effort to obtain some compensation and restitution for the losses of her mother and father, and the whole Japanese-American community by extension, which were only finalized a little over a decade ago, half a century later.

But if it's truly an 18mm focal length at the set marking, it will have the exact same FoV as the Tri-Elmar-M 16-18-21mm at the same focal length. Using the V10 on the CL is like using any other M-mount adapted lens: exposure modes are limited to Manual and Aperture priority AE, and you must focus the lens manually. You set aperture and focus on the lens using the lens' controls. (Of course, the DoF of a 10mm lens is so great that I normally just set f/8 and about 10 feet on the scale, and forget about it.) With such a short focal length, camera stability is critical for good sharpness so I push to keep the exposure time short: 1/100 second or less.

Using the V10 on the CL is like using any other M-mount adapted lens: exposure modes are limited to Manual and Aperture priority AE, and you must focus the lens manually. You set aperture and focus on the lens using the lens' controls. (Of course, the DoF of a 10mm lens is so great that I normally just set f/8 and about 10 feet on the scale, and forget about it.) With such a short focal length, camera stability is critical for good sharpness so I push to keep the exposure time short: 1/100 second or less. A tripod is a big gain in sharpness with these short lenses but I've been concentrating on hand-held work ... I used a tripod for these example photos and set focus based upon the easily measured distance from the bicycle helmet to the camera.

I use only the WATE wide-angle and 28mm and up. These lenses have until now worked well on many different sensors. And I would be very surprised if the S1R would be the only (negative) exception. Panasonic has probably no need to compromise their sensor to make it work with them. And yes, probably the SL2 will be the best solution. But maybe it still has mandatory LENR and it is certainly not the most economic solution. \ud83d\ude0e. But if you worry about S lenses then the cost is certainly no problem. Well, unfortunately my experience has not been quite so good as yours. The Leica M lenses I use most are the 35mm and 50mm Summilux ASPH, and both were quite bad on the Sony cameras. By bad I mean sharp in the center, but with poor edge and corner performance even when stopped down past 5.6. The 75mm Summicron was also not great. The only lens that seemed to perform very well was the 135mm Tele-Elmar. I have not tried the Nikon or Canon mirrorless. I am pretty demanding of lens performance as I tend to print rather large, and I found that, at least with the Sony's, it was better for me to stick with the native lenses. As for the S lenses, I made a big investment in them in 2011 or 2012, and since then I have used the same camera, so the math did work reasonably well for me. That said, they are worth a small fraction of what they cost because the S system has been so slow in adapting to the market. Cost of a Panasonic or even a SL2 might not be such a big deal, especially if I sell some equipment, but dropping 20,000 plus dollars on an S3 (if that is what it will cost) is most certainly not a \"no problem\" kind of purchase. Again, the Panasonics seemed like they could be the silver bullet, working nearly natively with M, L and S lenses, but as I said before, unfortunately it does not seem like that is quite as true as I had hoped.

I made the same experience. The thicker filter stack of most other brands definitely have a detrimental effect on IQ. Therefore M lenses seem to perform better on Leica M and maybe Nikon Z.

I have been gathering user feedback on the S1R to determine if I should buy it or just wait for SL2 ( the performance of S1R will be very close to SL2 minus the wonderful minimalist buttons shown on SL and S Leicas. Like you I specifically compare the AF performance of the S1R against commonly regarded good AF capability of the Sony A7Rlll. However I am specific looking for AF tracking performance on Leica SL lenses only. I do so because I already have a good feel on what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not from using those lenses on my SL. So like I said earlier I\u2019m looking for improvements on AF tracking especially on 90-280 VE. I did not find any let down in AF performance on the rest of my SL lenses using them on my SL. I am especially satisfied with the Face recognition on SL when it comes to AF performance. A word of caution on judging AF performance of 3rd party non L mount developed lenses on Panasonic developed DFD AF ( for Lumix & Leicas). Due to the lack of lens specific data stored in cameras, the AF performance will certainly be slow and it will hunt ( character of CDAF before algorithm enhancement). Read reviews and feedback with a pinch of salt. Judge if author is firstly familiar with camera. Handling a camera for a few hours and write a review will certainly vary from a Long term test of spending a few weeks in minimum to understand and learn the camera. Follow by looking at the type of pictures the author poses to determine if your questions on the camera is well experienced and articulated by author. I specifically hate those writers who take a few shots of non moving objects and slap on a general comment that says \u2018look elsewhere for sports and action photography as a lack of PDAF\u2019. These guys are just plain lazy and add no value in writing that. In judging AF performance reviews, I prefer looking into YouTube vids that compare S1R over A7Rlll for stills. You will find the performance of stills AF tracking of S1R performing on par against A7Rlll in a few reviews after firmware 1.0. To me comments are subjective and \u2018what you see\u2019 is objective. Happy searching. I largely agree with you. I generally dismiss any full-on review that was conducted within a week of camera release assuming they didn\u2019t have a prototype they worked with months prior to launch. That\u2019s one of my issues - there are plenty of reviews between April 2-10th and I doubt there was enough time to properly and fully evaluate unless the goal is to write a rolling review. Like you, I probably have zero plans to adapt non native lenses unless I plan on manually focusing them nearly exclusively. I\u2019ve done it before with mixed results if depending on AF. I think this gave early Sony cameras bad names where people never once tried some of the excellent native lenses. I can manually focus pretty quickly so it\u2019s not a big deal to do on any modern mirrorless. I\u2019ve watched many Youtube videos and they\u2019re all over the place because people have different levels of acceptable.

Does the R8 & R9 content cover design, construction and usage of these (to a similar depth as Eastland's Compendium)? Keith, I don't know Eastland's book, so I can't make actual comparisons. On the R8, the text in Long's book is a descriptive tour around the camera, describing the features and what is where.

The 2X Extender makes the 80mm F/1.4 into a 160 mm F/2.8 according to Leica's website (there is a list of lenses that the APO-extender works with on the website under the APO Extender). This is not the APO-extender but an older one. ... I find the result a bit milky and hard to get real sharp. I also did some tests with the 50mm F/2.0 which I will post a bit later. The 2x Extender-R isn't quite as good optically as the APO version is, but it will return excellent results depending on the primary lens it is being used with AND the aperture that you're using. The R80/1.4 is likely not the best lens to use with it, particularly wide open ... Ultra-fast lenses like that are rarely at their best wide open. Here are a couple of sample photos I made with it using the CL body and two different lenses: Leica CL + Elmarit-R 135mm + 2x Extender-R ISO 800 @ f/4 @ 1/4k The R135+extender makes a good 3D macro setup. That's at about 5.5 foot distance and near wide open for limited DoF. Note that the model is 1:43 scale and is about 4 inches long. This next little test shows how it looks going from wide open to two stops down with the R180/4 (Elmar-R): Leica CL + Elmar-R 180mm f/4 + 2x Extender-R (wide open aperture) (two stops down) I think the 2x Extender-R is quite a nice performer if you take into account its limitations, and it only cost me $60.

I find the OOC files less appealing, but that has the upside that I am forced to make them what I want, instead of just admiring the beautiful Leica S rendition and staying close to that. But still, an X1D and three lenses weighs less than an S(007) and 24mm lens (my workhorse). I wish there was a 24mm XCD, but I'm getting used to 21mm and 30mm.

The problem is not always being very unsharp, it is uneven sharpness...having something going from incredibly sharp on center to slightly unsharp on the edge...in a way, the extremely high performance on center is working against you because it makes you notice the less than perfect performance at the edges. I know for my 30-90mm lens at least, that there is no aperture at which I can get critically sharp edges when longer than about 65mm. It is not a matter of focus, although I do find the focusing pattern of the wide angle lenses to be consistently short in a lot of compositions. Anyway, you can have a look at two pictures that show the issue I occasionally have. They are full sized jpegs though, so I need to use a dropbox link. I should say that in general these photos are sharp, but this kind of sharpness can be troublesome in very large prints, which I occasionally make. In general, however, I like the lens and can work around these issues.

Considering getting rid of my S body and three lenses for the SL2 - as I am also an SL owner and have invested in the L Mount system also across Lumix and Sigma (as of Sunday I also have the Sigma fp). So I have a great deal more L mount lenses and adapters than I do most anything else. I also have a Pentax 645Z as a medium format backup to my S, and that is larger or the same resolution as the SL2 at 50MP. Here is what I think... If you want a fast mirrorless camera with high resolution up to 3200 ISO (more on this later), you want to use a WIDE variety of lenses including RF lenses that are \"almost\" as good as on an M, and you want to print large or do some streaming video at 4-5K with IBIS handheld but with an external monitor (no flippy screen), then the SL2 is your camera. Not the equally high MP S1R, not the original SL, not the FP, not the S1H - the SL2. It's \"good enough\" for all of that, if not best in class... for what it is. But that ISN'T what the S system is. Leica made the S as a competitor to Hasselblad when Dr. Kaufman couldn't buy it more or less. It was, like many things in Leica's history, a first of its kind - a sort of hybrid DSLR and Medium Format product that had the same crop factor as 35MM film and a larger sensor. The S STILL remains UNIQUE on the landscape of Medium Format digital cameras for a few reasons. Its philosophy is rather different than the Sony, Fuji, and yes now even Leica 2019 market. Up until very recently, Leica unlike all of its competitors, was exceptionally conservative with its technology choices - preferring to optimize quality over \"features\" and made very unique offerings that were \"luxury-like\", but still very reliable to the small group of people that would use them. Think of Apple before essentially beat the shit out of Microsoft, those of us in design and photography still used them, but you wouldn't see the Apple logo on every single table of every single coffeehouse in every single town across the world. We knew that we were paying for the logo, but what that meant was we were also paying for the \"better\" experience - which was proven later when everyone wanted one. When Apple decided to make a successful line of laptops for pros and everyone and then the iPhone and iPad. Leica, for better or for worse, is on that path with its L mount line. The S... well it's a \"Mac Pro\". You pay a premium, the device has a shelf life, isnt really modular (neither is the Fuji GX series) and well, you get a solid camera that you can use for years that performs what its CORE value is in the way it was designed. The S isnt a system for everyone. It's not meant to be. Now, from what I have heard on who this system is aimed at - the pro or hobbyist with deep pockets that could afford a say Hassy or a Phase One system - that market is not exactly suffering. The IQ of the current S when put up against higher MP backs of its same generation like the Phase IQ 50 or the Sony designed 50MP because of the lenses if not market competitive, on the IQ front is equal if not better. How do I know? Because the folks in my group of working pros and I have shot the same things with their systems and I get a very unique look with my S - Both the CCD and CMOS varieties. The lenses, as has been said here, are not the technically *perfect* L mount Leica variety - but they are absolutely UNIQUE on the market. No there isnt OIS, but there is a leaf style shutter, no there isn't APOCHROMATIC perfection - but do you ALWAYS want a perfect clean image, every single time (?), no the AF isn't the fastest - but with that optical VF you can hit your focus unless you just can't see. It's handling is great. its menu system is FAST. Is it as fast as a mirrorless? No. Is it as fast as a DSLR? No. Does it matter to most of its customers? No, not at all. We who want an S know what we are getting into with the S. I'm a photographer, I'm not personally competing with some engineers at some camera company. I'm making images. Thats all I want to *focus* on. Now, that said. I think its absolutely essential that you know what you want out of your camera system (s). I personally want a M to be like the M10, but don't hate the M240/M246. I don't know if I want more than 24 MP on a Full Frame sensor. I like having high ISO options instead of fast glass. I like to get my focus fast. I like the \"just right\" MP of a 24MP sensor on a FF camera. I like the SL typ 601 because it has that style of sensor and I can use more than just the L mount lenses and feel like I have an optimized sensor. I think that the 47 MP sensor may even be BETTER for M lenses, for some applications, but I like going the ISO 6400 and beyond with the \"smaller cameras\". But do I need or want high resolution on a FF when I have a larger sensor camera or cameras for that? Maybe if the SL were my ONLY precision SLR, I may want the higher MP. maybe if I needed or wanted some of its features. I also don't rely or even like autofocus that much, on ANY camera... so the SL is a different tool for me. I want to use my existing lenses. I have what I need. I am interested but not quite ready to upgrade (but I may do it anyway, we will see). The M is the perfect FF camera for the type of work I like to do with an M, and the SL has always been used as the Swiss-German Army Knife for everything else with a fast shutter when I needed that. Owning a Leica has meant that you don't HAVE to update your body when a new one comes out, only if you WANT to. How many original SL's will stay in use? How many S2/S typ 006 are still being used? What you have is the best of its class at the time and onward. Hell, I even still shoot the M8, M9, original Monochrom if the look requires it. We will update when we update, get what we need when it seems like we need it. Its an illusion that we need anything else to make what we make in 2019. That said... The S... well, the S is my *money shot*. I have gotten images out of the S I could NEVER get with any other system. That was worth the price of admission, and also worth the depreciation, which has been incredibly fast. Because 37MP has been good since 2009, and will be good until I decide to upgrade to 64/100/whatever, its fine for MOST things, and my lenses will still be some of the best in the business until we move entirely to computational photography (and when that happens, I am happy to have my *legacy* Leica tech). We had issues with AF in the S lenses for some time, I think mostly that has been addressed since like 2017. The S3 update looks to be a good one, and although there are \"technical\" details being perfected in Wetzlar, I don't mind waiting. Hell, I may not even update for some time.

Last thought: Do we always need the latest tech to get the best images? I don't think so, I just think we need the best for what it is and for how we want to shoot.

'm -----> making !!!  images. thats all i want to *focus* on. now, that said. i think its absolutely essential that you know what you want out of your camera system (s). i personally want a m to be like the m10, but don't hate the m240/m246. i don't know if i want more than 24 mp on a full frame sensor. i like having high iso options instead of fast glass. i like to get my focus fast. i like the \"just right\" mp of a 24mp sensor on a ff camera. i like the sl typ 601 because it has that style of sensor and i can use more than just the l mount lenses and feel like i have an optimized sensor. i think that the 47 mp sensor may even be better for m lenses, for some applications, but i like going the iso 6400 and beyond with the \"smaller cameras\". but do i need or want high resolution on a ff when i have a larger sensor camera or cameras for that? maybe if the sl were my only precision slr, i may want the higher mp. maybe if i needed or wanted some of its features. i also don't rely or even like autofocus that much, on any camera... so the sl is a different tool for me. i want to use my existing lenses. i have what i need. i am interested but not quite ready to upgrade (but i may do it anyway, we will see). the m is the perfect ff camera for the type of work i like to do with an m, and the sl has always been used as the swiss-german army knife for everything else with a fast shutter when i needed that. owning a leica has meant that you don't have to update your body when a new one comes out, only if you want to. how many original sl's will stay in use? how many s2/s typ 006 are still being used? what you have is the best of its class at the time and onward. hell, i even still shoot the m8, m9, original monochrom if the look requires it. we will update when we update, get what we need when it seems like we need it. its an illusion that we need anything else to make what we make in 2019. that said... the s... well, the s is my *money shot*. i have gotten images out of the s i could never get with any other system. that was worth the price of admission, and also worth the depreciation, which has been incredibly fast. because 37mp has been good since 2009, and will be good until i decide to upgrade to 64/100/whatever, its fine for most things, and my lenses will still be some of the best in the business until we move entirely to computational photography (and when that happens, i am happy to have my *legacy* leica tech). we had issues with af in the s lenses for some time, i think mostly that has been addressed since like 2017. the s3 update looks to be a good one, and although there are \"technical\" details being perfected in wetzlar, i don't mind waiting. hell, i may not even update for some time. and if i get the sl2, well i might go ahead and get that s adapter l too, because i like my s lenses that much. i used it on the sl 2 and the af was excellent. it will crop in but maybe that's ok. last thought: do we always need the latest tech to get the best images? i don't think so, i just think we need the best for what it is and for how we want to shoot. you can choose to keep up with it, or you can just make the best images you can with the best equipment you have.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 29488, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Jan1985", "date": "2019-11-15 22:01:00", "content": "You are totally right.

Right, can we just be like the old days and *know* our systems to the point to where we accept their very minimal imperfections and MAYBE even utilize them? For someone choosing over an SL2 and a S typ 007, I would say - rent or borrow BOTH and shoot them BOTH and see which one has the IMAGE QUALITY you want. You can evidently pick up an S on the used market for about what you would spend on a SL2 and 24-90 L, maybe even less. Get the 70 (50 equivalent) and you have a system that isnt THAT heavy and you have medium format quality in a Leica. All this said, if full frame is fine for what you do, you are totally imbedded in the Leica ecosystem of lenses (or even M mount) then the SL2 is a no brainer. But if you want to have something you won't mid keep using as a primary camera for a decade... the S is one of those cameras. I support Leica going forward, but I also know that we got something badass for what it was at the time. The best of the tech at the price point. Oh, and as for the VIDEO on the S typ 007, I know a lot of people *scoffed* at the specs at first. I will refute that. I shot some close up scenes with it AS IS, hand held in 4K. Some of the best footage I had. I also used TWO SL1s on that same shoot. This was a year or so ago. I just took the unused footage and made a little montage story and I have to say, it holds up. Contrasty, and maybe not what a video editor wants all the time, but its a *look* and in that it is A-OK. I more look forward to what the S3 can do with full frame video with its LARGE sensor and lenses than the FF SL2, with 100MPS and all of the current bevy of functions. Not that I wouldn't be happy with it. If people really want that fully functioning professional cinematic video they likely won't choose an SL2, they will go for the S1H if they want to stick with L mount glass. I don't like the Lumix S1H color science, although for professional settings it is the only Mirrorless that is spec at Netflix. It might be a better option for people that want that. For a cinematographer that wants a directors viewfinder and on set camera, I think the SL2 is a fine hybrid video camera! I just wish it did RAW so it could be usable in a number of settings - even DNG RAW, 12bit like the Sigma fp.. but, hey there are firmware updates, no? I never liked L log, but I *DO* LOVE the color science of Leica...

I invested very heavily in the system for my business, including selling a full Nikon setup, film cameras from Hasselblad and Rollei as well as every bit and piece I could part with to get in. While I am still happy with the cameras, I am disappointed that the promise of the S system never really came through quite as it was sold at the time. The professional service and turnaround times have mostly been forgotten. I called the S service hotline at Leica Germany the other day and asked about a few things regarding the camera and the customer service rep said he did not know much about the technical aspects of the S system. This is their own pro hotline... We are going on more than ten years without a resolution bump (the announced by delayed S3 does not count until you can actually buy it), and we have not had a major new lens or accessory for six years. There are no teleconverters, no long lenses, no wide angle tilt shifts, no compact primes, no integrated flash transmitters etc. It is a testament to the strength of the cameras and lenses that they are even still competitive at all, given how little apparent development Leica has given to them in the last few years. I find the \"speculation\" as you put it is an important part of planning my future equipment for my business....will the S3 be a refresh for the system, or the last hurrah as they move forward with a different style of cameras like the SL. It seems pretty clear to me that the future is with the SL system, but we will of course see. I am hedging my bets and will most likely get an SL2 and see how well it serves my needs. At least I will be able to use the lenses. P.S. The great street prices are also not so great if you bought your cameras new and at or near retail price. That is another consideration...if you got in the S system early, it is extremely hard to get out without taking a brutal loss on every component. If the S gets revitalized, than hopefully some of those values will climb a bit. Stuart, I wish Leica would read your post, it summed up the S system well. As an amateur I am now putting my S system on hold, every few uses results in another repair issue with sensors and lenses. I'll wait to see what the future brings before making any further decisions. The M system has been reliable for me, the mechanical lenses are welcome respite from all the electronics. I wonder if Leica feels the system is mature with the inclusion of adapters from Hasselblad, Mamiya and others. There were several lenses in the original lineup that were never introduced but the Hasselblad H lenses could be used with almost native functionality. I am not making excuses for Leica, rather trying to make sense of this completely ignored system and their thinking. Several years ago the T system had very depressed lens prices, Leica also appeared to be ignoring it. The TL2/CL introductions brought the lens values up quckly.

I think this is primarily a function of lens focal length and tonality. I think the same advantages that applied in the days of film still apply today. You might be able to take tech pan in a 35mm camera and make an extremely sharp, grainless negative, but it still does not have the feel of an image from a larger format. When I bought into the Leica S, I sold a Leica R kit and a Nikon DSLR kit, as well as some MF film gear to cover the cost. The s2 was far beyond anything 35mm offered at the time, and I loved the color and capabilities it had. It was like nothing I had shot before on digital. I am still using basically the same camera 8 years later, though I bumped up to the 006 after the 007 came out. Aside from the results, the lenses and ergonomics are much better than anything else that was available when I bought them. The combination of reliable focus (for me, though I know others do not agree), perfect weather sealing, easily handling in the dark and with even mittens, as well as the well thought out interface and beautiful viewfinder mean that it is hard to take much pleasure out of using 35mm mirrorless cameras, all of which feel in some way compromised to me compared to the S. Even the GFX felt clunky to me in comparison. These days, lens makers have really upped their game, and I feel like some of the lenses available now match or exceed some of the S lenses...for example the SL lenses of course, as well as the lenses for the GFX, X1D and things like the Sigma Art lenses (which I have not used, but have some incredible MTF and reviews). Still, I think if the S3 is a big improvement over the S007, then the S system will continue to be one of the best all around camera systems available, albeit at a very high price. I should also note that my perspective on file quality is that of an exhibition printer, and rarely do I ever see anything better than what the S006 can produce. Even Phase One cameras don't seem to look as nice if people just give me the files with default sharpening and less than perfect technique. They are certainly capable of besting the S, but I do not think they look as nice right out of camera. This of course just based on a fairly limited sample group.

My family and I travelled to Tuscany for just over two weeks in May. The S 007 along as my walk-about with the 70, 35 and Contax 120. And that included the 463 step schlep up a very old, claustrophobic and twisted stair case up to the top of the dome. Security is tight. I put my case on the table and pulled out the S with 70mm attached. The guard looked at it, then me, then it and said \"macchina interessante.\" Then he gestured his colleague over. A man of fewer words, the guard, just said \"bella.\" So the newly christened Bella and I made our way towards the heavens. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate to have \"named\" Bella in the Baptistry building. But, the cathedral was a solid alternative. This is my first travel excursion with the 007, having shot the 006 for three years or so. It is a more flexible camera in virtually every respect. Faster, quieter and with a shooting envelope that extends well beyond the practical reach of the 006, which I rarely shot, in color, over 800, and mostly at base ISO. Conversely, I could shoot the 007 all day long at 3200/6400 with outstanding results. The extended shooting range allowed me to capture interior images, especially in churches, that would have been impossible, hand-held, with the 006. Part of it, is the quieter shutter. Definitely a difference. Now, I am still trying to warm up to the cooler sensor qualities vs the 006. To be sure, it presents a more clinical look - rather like what I get from the Q. But the files are extraordinarily malleable. I was amazed to bring back to life duds that needed three additional stops. And one image looked lost through overexposure. And taking two stops out made it presentable. It feels almost like cheating. One thing I prefer with the 006 is how you can set it to A and then adjust the shutter speed or aperture opening using the two dials. At least, that is how I recall doing it (been a while since I fired it up). But in A with the S 007, seems to me that it does not work the same way - and that adjusting one will cause the camera to compensate by automatically changing the other to maintain what it thinks is the right exposure. So I had to go into the Exposure comp, which is a bit of a pain, and I never know how it gets what it gets - ISO vs. shutter vs aperture. Can anyone suggest a workaround so that I can have the camera in A, and then use the two right dials independently. I would typically have the camera in A, shoot, and then adjust manually to taste. I did find that the 007 auto focus seemed to hunt more than the 006, with the 70mm. Have others had that experience? I did discover that my camera does not like the latest Lexar card with the fast transfer speed. Images had all kind of electronic distortion. So I went back to my trusty SanDisk cards which worked flawlessly. All in all, the trip validated my decision to add Bella to the collection. But there will surely be times when the shoot calls for the magic of a CCD sensor. And that is when Bella's sister will come out.

Historically, 37.5mp is enough for medium format. Especially with a larger sensor, it compares very well to 645 and even 6x7 (where the S is finer grained or grainless and its detail is sharper, though it may not have quite as much detail in certain circumstances, and film still enlarges more gracefully in the extreme sizes, based on the difference in rendering). With respect to general use as well, 37.5mp is enough for most users. For example a lot of fashion or portrait photographers might appreciate the look of lenses, color and tonality more than they might in a 35mm camera, while not really worrying much about resolution. They do not often have to print much larger than a magazine spread, or for commercial displays which often have quite a long viewing distance. But when it comes to art photography, landscape work and areas of commercial work that expect larger enlargements, then 37.5 can certainly be increased. 64mp is very welcome in that sense, and indeed, with all else being equal, more resolution tracks with more quality...it means less moire, better tonality, better microcontrast, finer grain, more ability to crop and better color fidelity. All else being equal is the operative phrase here. Of course, the 007, 006 and S2 are great cameras and will continue to be once the S3 is released. It is a bit foolhardy, however, to ignore the fact that there are many less expensive cameras that can outresolve them, outdo them in high ISO performance and so on. Technology keeps moving on and it does not tend to spare Leica and their 4-7 year MF sensor cycle. Yes that is what I noticed.

Not in the way it handles ergonomically, which is all very familiar, but once the S007 is in your hands you feel that this is the second, much more sophisticated iteration. The mirror and the shutter are a lot quieter than the S2-P and they sound like they were made for hundreds of thousands of effortless exposures. I love my S2-P but the mechanics of this newer S007 feel and sound much more reassuring and the same goes for the autofocus which is noticeably faster. Not that I care much for faster autofocus, I'd rather have more accuracy.When it comes to colours, I have a feeling that the out of the box colours from the CCD sensor are more friendly to my eyes than the newer CMOS 007. For instance in my test shots, blue skies have a tendency to be some more cyan-ish on the S007 than the S2-CCD. Maybe that's just my eyes, I don't know. But anyway, there was nothing going on color-wise, that could not be easily corrected or altered to taste in Lightroom, the files are extremely malleable. People on this forum who have experience with the Leica M240 will know what I mean when I talk about the difference between the M240 and the M9 colours. Actually, that is one of my problems with the S007, it's a very good camera and a very good sensor, but it is 5-6 year old sensor technology.I was very pleasantly surprised by how good 3200 ISO is. I am used to the look of the high ISO shots I make with the Sony RX1M2 which I use for reportage work and that camera has the same 42-Mpix full-frame CMOS sensor as the Sony A7R II, but the noise on the Leica S007 looks a whole lot more friendly and grain-like. The noise on the S007 is just so much softer and nicer to look at, not as harsh and contrasty as on a reasonably well sharpened Sony sensor file.As for for the choice between an S3 and an S007, I (try to) sell fine art prints of my work and I'd really like to be able to make larger prints and that's where the 64MP from the S3 will come in very handy, the reason why I am a little bit on the fence right now about which camera to choose. And although I must say that I think I could be very happy with the S007 because it is really a big step up from my S2-P, the extra 26,5 megapixels from an S3 would be nice to play with. And at the moment there are rumors (just rumors I need to emphasize) that the all new S3 will not be as expensive as the first S system cameras when they came to market because of the strong competition from Hasselblad and Fuji, around 10 to 15 thousand. So right now I'm leaning towards waiting for just a little bit longer to find out what the price difference will be.I crossposted my original question (and some of my replies) and I also asked here over at LuLa, not just for laughs, but hoping I\u2019d get some replies from people who are not Leica-biased, so to speak. Unfortunately, the usual suspects (the same people that 2-5 years ago when I used to frequent LuLa more often, in every thread told everyone that medium format was dead and had, since the arrival of the Nikon 850, no significant role to play anymore in 21st century photography) came in and started talking about so called 'Leica jewellery\u2019.Anyway, the outcome was as always: \"no one in his right mind would buy a Leica now that we should all be celebrating the second coming of JC Fujifilm GFX cameras with their 43.8 x 32.9mm sensors and how Fuji glass is such a good investment, especially with the hundred megapixel sensor coming this summer and anyone who chooses otherwise is just not in their right mind, or a complete idiot and doesn't know anything about photography anyway.\" Actually there were some interesting replies there too, but I can understand why there is so little traffic on their medium format sub forum nowadays. Why the hell every other thread about any given medium format equipment has to be turned into a Fuji-thread, I really don't know. Is it really true than that people only look at spec sheets and prices, I wonder? I decided, instead of replying and tell them exactly how I think about their prejudiced responses, to use my energy in a more constructive way for myself by taking a really good look at the Fujis and so I downloaded a dozen files, imported them into Lightroom (I first needed to convert them to DNG) and take a really good look.Man, am I glad I invested in my Leica S system equipment. I know it's all personal, but from what I saw, I must say that I don't like the Fuji lenses with their harsh specular highlights and awful bokeh, I don't like the Fuji colours, and I don't like the files coming from the Sony sensor, which to me is too much of a step back to the quality of the files from my Sony RX1M2, just a little bit bigger. Oh, and I don't care for 4:3, I like to crop and print wide, so there are millions of pixels wasted for me on the 4:3 aspect ratio. Once I started sharpening the Fuji test files and applied my usual Leica S2-P sharpening settings I got the feeling that the images started falling apart and they started looking very brittle to my eye. So I consider this to be a good thing, because although it took me a few hours to find out, I have for now made it clear to myself that I have no interest in the Fuji-hype. So where do I go from here? I don't know, the money will stay in the bank for now and I will look at the Panasonic and the upcoming Leica SL2 options, but I feel that what I really want at the moment is just wait and see how the S3 is going to fare.

But here are my strong preferences, based on my extensive use of the S tethered (and more recently, the SL also): (a) Fix the Tethered Plugin for Lightroom. Leica know it is broken; they even say so on the download page in the owners' area (\"Changing camera user profiles in the camera during tethered connection could lead to a software crash and/ or an image loss! Solution: User profiles should not be changed when the camera is connected to the computer!\"). The plugin allows you to select an import preset but it never applies it. This is a significant impediment - when shooting in a studio, I always shoot tethered and I want me and my team to see how the images are coming out. Not only that, some of the presets apply compression of shadows or highlights and I want to be sure, at the time of capture, that I am not loosing any detail to under or overexposure. If the theme of the shoot is \"high contrast black and white\", for example, I want the images to come up on the screen with a high contrast BW preset applied. If I am shooting a theme with a \"film look\", I want the images to show up with whatever film preset I have decided to use (say Mastin Labs Portra 160). The Leica version of the plugin just does not apply these presets, even if you select them, which is infuriating. I notified Leica about the problem on 2nd February 2017 - they still haven't fixed it. The contact person on the email was Thomas Schmidt. Characteristically, the Fuji version of the plugin, which looks exactly the same, applies all the presets as selected, no problemo. Mr. Schmidt, if you are reading this, can you please explain why the Fuji plugin works and the exactly same-looking Leica plugin doesn't? Apart from this, the Fuji cameras now tether directly in Capture One, which is a faster and more reliable tethering solution than Lightroom. Of course, one can use whatever presets in C1 during tethering with the Fuji cameras, so they come up on the screen with the preset applied. The Leica work-around (using Image Shuttle and setting a hot folder in C1) is not great because, of course,....no prizes for guessing..... it doesn't allow me to apply any import preset...so the files just show on the screen with the \"generic DNG\" profile, and not with the \"Spring Collection preset No. 2\" applied. (b) Use the Lemo connector, same as on the S cameras, also on the SL2. Do not use the stupid generic USB 3 connector that's on the SL. Why? Because, like in all so equipped cameras (including the D850, GFX50S to name just a few) the tether cable just keeps getting loose and forces us to use various \"jerk stoppers\" and other assorted stupid contraptions, just to keep the cable connected. The Lemo connector on the S is a thing of beauty, it just plugs in and stays connected (thank you Leica for using Lemo on the S cameras). So please use the Lemo connector on the SL2. (c) It would be nice to offer some profiles - Phase One provides (offers for sale) various development presets, looks, that can be applied in C1, to get to a more advanced starting point, with grading applied, while shooting. Fuji famously provides the film simulation import presets (Acros with green filter, anyone?). Whereas all we get from Leica is the Adobe looks (we used to get the \"Embedded\" also, whatever that was, but it seems to have disappeared in the most recent versions of Lightroom). Would it be so difficult to give us some nice Agfa APX 100 or RSX presets, for example (to keep it all \"at home\", so to speak)? Staying in Germany, could Leica perhaps collaborate with https://www.basiccolor.de to offer specific presets for various light sources? I forked out the full price for the basiccolor solution and it ended up in a frustration: the profiles generated by the software did not look right, too much red etc. (I am sure I made a mistake somewhere but perhaps Leica could do this right for us, properly, just like Phase One do in their \"Cultural Heritage\" package, where every back comes with a super-precise set of colour profiles). It is not strictly necessary for me, but I would love such an offering from Leica. BTW, there used to be a specific colour profile for the S2 available for download in the owners' area - why not one (or more) for the S, SL...etc.? If Thomas Schmidt and his merry band of pirates want to send me a questionnaire, I will be happy to answer it for them. In the meantime, see my suggestions here.

Ray is an impressive man and this article is worthy reading. Rob =========================================================================================================================== Why I Went to Auschwitz Ray Allen NBA AUG 3 2017 There was a small hole in the kitchen floor that led to a secret crawl space. That image is burned into my memory. The space was maybe five feet long by five feet wide. The owner of the house said, \u201cThey used to fit six people inside there. When the Nazis would come.\u201d His name was Tadeusz Skoczylas, and the house we were in had belonged to his family during World War II. It was a small brick house in the town of Ciepiel\u00f3w, Poland. It had a red roof that had seen better days. The front door was just a few steps off the street. In the backyard were a few barns and other small shacks. I had been in Poland for a few days already, and the horror of the history I had experienced was overwhelming. But this was something different. This was so personal. I\u2019m looking at this tiny space. And I\u2019m imagining six people down there, hiding from death. Six real people. Crawling through that little hole right in front of me. Not that long ago. It wasn\u2019t a history book. It wasn\u2019t a museum. It was right there. --img--  Tadeusz explained that one day in 1942, Nazi soldiers visited the house on a tip. Someone in the village had told them that the family had been harboring Jewish people. There were supposed to be 10 Skoczylas living in the house. On this particular day, the youngest boy in the family was not home when the soldiers came by. The Nazis grew suspicious and began tearing the house apart. They found the hole and the crawl space, but the Jewish people the family had been hiding were not there. They had already moved on. Without saying a word, the Nazis went next door to a neighboring family and took their young son. The punishment for hiding Jews was death for the entire family, and they had a quota to fill. The soldiers took all 10 people out back and executed them right in front of those barns and shacks that are still standing there today. When the little Skoczylas boy returned home, he found his entire family dead. That little boy was Tadeusz\u2019s grandfather. The house stayed in the Skoczylas family, and his grandfather lived in it. Now Tadeusz and his mother live in it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. And as I walked through the rest of the house, this feeling sort of took over me. There was all this history right in front of me. And it was real. I could reach out and touch it. I could feel it between my fingers and smell it in the air. It was a tangible thing. I took that trip just a few months ago. It was my first time in Poland. I went there to learn more about something that had fascinated me since I was a teenager: the Holocaust. I\u2019d read so many books and articles about it, but reading words on a page is not the same thing as seeing things up close. Advertisement Then I visited the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., for the first time. It was 1998, and I was playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. I was in D.C. meeting our owner, Herb Kohl, over the summer. We had some time free time on my last day in the city, and Mr. Kohl suggested we go to the Holocaust Museum on the National Mall. I\u2019ll never forget how I felt after those two hours in there \u2014 I could have spent two days. My immediate feeling was that everyone needs to go there. There was one room in particular, though, that I think about often. It\u2019s filled with photos of Jews from a town in Poland. The pictures line the walls and extend up toward the sky, where light floods in from a window. Almost 90% of the people in the images were sent to their death. Before they were taken to concentration camps or executed, they would leave their prized possessions behind with friends or family. The people of these Jewish communities were pushed to the absolute limit of their human instincts. They just wanted to survive. And from that, the tales of brotherhood and camaraderie are so awe-inspiring. It was a reminder of what the human spirit is capable of \u2014 both for good and evil. --img--  Honestly \u2026 it made me feel sort of irrelevant. Which was a strange thought to have as a young NBA player who was supposed to be on top of the world. I was realizing that there were things outside of my bubble that mattered so much more. I wanted my teammates to feel that as well. So every team I played on after that, whenever we were in D.C. playing the Wizards, I would ask our coach if we had time to go through the museum. Every visit was different, but each guy came out thanking me for taking us there. I could see in their eyes that they had a different perspective on life after that experience. I thought I knew what the Holocaust was, and what it meant. I went to Poland with a few close friends to learn more. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for how deeply the visit would affect me. I had seen so many documentaries and films on Auschwitz, but nothing really prepares you for being there. The first thing I felt when I walked through those iron gates was \u2026 heavy. The air around me felt heavy. I stood on the train tracks where the prisoners of the camp would arrive, and I felt like I could hear the trains coming to a halt. I had to take a breath to center myself. It was so immediate. So overwhelming. We walked through the barracks and gas chambers and what I remember most is what I heard: nothing. I\u2019ve never experienced silence like that. Apart from footsteps, the complete lack of sound was almost jarring. It\u2019s eerie and sobering. You\u2019re standing in these rooms where so much death has taken place and your mind is trying to come to terms with all that\u2019s happened in this space. One question keeps repeating over and over and over in your mind: How can human beings do this to one another? How does somebody process that? You can\u2019t. This is not history. This is humanity. This is now. This is a living lesson for us as a people. After Tadeusz Skoczylas took us through his family\u2019s home, I stood outside for a while by myself, thinking about everything I had experienced. Why do we learn about the Holocaust? Is it just so we can make sure nothing like this ever happens again? Is it because six million people died? Yes, but there\u2019s a bigger reason, I think. Advertisement The Holocaust was about how human beings \u2014 real, normal people like you and me \u2014 treat each other. --img--  When the Skoczylas family was risking their own lives to hide people they barely knew, they weren\u2019t doing it because they practiced the same religion or were the same race. They did it because they were decent, courageous human beings. They were the same as those people crouched in a hole. And they knew that those people didn\u2019t deserve what was being done to them. I asked myself a really tough question: Would I have done the same? Really, would I have done the same? When I returned home to America, I got some very disheartening messages directed toward me on social media regarding my trip. Some people didn\u2019t like the fact that I was going to Poland to raise awareness for the issues that happened there and not using that time or energy to support people in the black community. I was told my ancestors would be ashamed of me. I know there are trolls online and I shouldn\u2019t even pay attention, but that one sort of got to me. Because I understood where they were coming from. I understand that there are plenty of issues in our own country right now, but they were looking at my trip the wrong way. I didn\u2019t go to Poland as a black person, a white person, a Christian person or a Jewish person \u2014 I went as a human being. --img--  It\u2019s easy to say \u201cI went to make sure these things don\u2019t happen again.\u201d But I went to learn about the true reality of what happened during the Holocaust, and what we can take from that. The people who believe that I am not spending my time the way the right way \u2026 well, they\u2019re missing the entire point. We shouldn\u2019t label people as this thing or that thing. Because by doing so, you create these preconceived notions, which is how we get into these horrible situations in the first place. We have to do a better job breaking through ignorance and the close-mindedness and the divisions that are plaguing our society in 2017. I remember being a kid in elementary school, and we all used to have a couple pen pals from around the world. I was so excited to hear back from people in different countries. I wanted to know about how they lived. I was curious about their lives. And I feel like we\u2019ve lost that a little bit. It seems like now, we only see us. We only want to look out for us. Whatever us even means. I think about the Tadeusz family. Who did they define as us? They saw us as every human being, regardless of what they looked like, or what they believed. They thought everyone was worth protecting. And they were willing to die for it. That is something worth remembering, always. --img--  Ray Allen NBA Why I Went to Auschwitz | By Ray Allen.webloc Edited September 29, 2019 by ropo54", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/286989-auschwitz/page/6/?tab=comments#comment-3827832", "origin": "L-forum", "suborigin": "286989-auschwitz", "result": true, "Selector": "we can make", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "apropos of the discussion that has been going back and forth in these last few threads. for those of you know who may not know ray allen, he is a recently retired african-american nba all-star and world champion boston celtics basketball player. while still a rising star in college backbetall, he also played a lead character in one of spike lee's movies, \"he got game\".

Two hours of knowledge and messages. A very personal report. I noticed the event with Peter Karbe too late. It was fully booked, and only thanks to the wonderful Bodo Philipp of Leica Store Berlin and his friendly colleague Benedikt Hartmann of Store Wetzlar, I have slipped in. He was also the one who sent my summary questions from the forum to Peter Karbe and even introduced me to him in the store. He, in turn, had read everything and immediately clarified that he would refuse any answer to future planning. It became not that bad in the end. Karbe is an incredibly nice person. One who lives his work in harmony with his own thinking. He doesn't need a sales approach. Even when he says, \"You've never gotten as much value as with these new lenses.\" It comes as a sober statement. And when he explains that when polishing aspheric lenses, the human skills factor is crucial, because unclean polishing produces onion rings and the whole thing is a quality but also price driver, then we stop whispering. So I try to write down everything I can catch and that I think is interesting in order to be able to reproduce it as close as possible to the spoken word later on, or at least as a sense. He announces hard boring stuff. Expectation management. The digital evolutionary In the first few minutes, he clears up a clich\u00e9 known to Leica enthusiasts (like me): \"We never slept through the digital revolution, but our priority was the Leica M. We adapted the digital technology (above all sensors) to the M and not the other way around. It just took time.\" It is apparently more the electronics than the optics that are the technology drivers of the current progress. And he constantly \u201eevolutionese\u201c them. In other words, we could forget the finest optics that we now get for the SL without mastering all the associated technologies: \"The complexity of the entire process chain was like driving backwards with a number of trailers. To do this, we had to lay new rails. That's why it took so long.\" Something astonishing to our ears when he says that the lenses should have become less sensitive to a higher offset of the individual lenses due to AF. Centering, closing, controlling, reopening, correcting \u2013 for example, the process with M-lenses, that would no longer be possible if everything is adjusted and glued. When asked by the audience about the quality of service with so much complexity: \"Don't worry about that.\" You don't do it if you listen to him. The Optics Challenger Most Leica photographers know his statement that the new generation of lenses can easily manage 100 million pixels. Few people know the derivation except for some of the connoisseurs gathered here. I finally understood it as plausible, though not so deeply that I could explain it in detail. So for all those who, like me, feel good with just some more plausibility: \"With the SL summicrons (also the Summilux SL 50 and also other lenses like the Q lens) we have increased our target by 50%(!) up to 60 lp per mm at 50% contrast. Because it used to be 40 lp before.\" Some manufacturers still work with 30 lp and one (no, I do not name it here) internally with 50. He casually notes that it was the work on the APSC sensor which has already begun to raise the benchmark. When this was finally successful, it was clear that there must be more for the SL system. So that's how it was. Then the explanation for the 100 million pixel statement comes up, the Nyquist frequency for the various pixel values that are now possible. It is 172 lp per mm for 100 MP sensor at 100% contrast. Thus 50% contrast (1/ 2 Nyquist) would be 86 lp. Karbe: \u201cThis is not any problem to our lenses, even in the corners.\u201d And then the superlative: \u201eOur Summicron SL 35 is also our best lens because we had a lot room for 35 mm in that tube.\u201d It handles 204 lp / mm at 50% contrast. Silence in the room. For some people, maybe not so new all this. To me it was quite new \u2013 hard but not boring at all. There are some comments on color defects, CA etc. The lenses are corrected so that the color failure to be corrected on the computer is practical 0. Even I can see that. Finally (thanks from me as an unfortunate S-user to the questioner), the question of S-lenses remains not unanswered. Indeed, they were expected to be 50% for 40 Lp, but: \u201cThere you have less additional magnification. The final picture result is much better at the S.\u201c Thank God. By the way he says, they do only as much as really need to make software corrections of the lenses. As the Leica-JPEG's contrast are not so much too high exaggerated, some tests in magazines are dropping them. I don't care. The sharpness-blur juggler. He also wanted to clarify his view on the sharpness / blur reaction of these SL Crons. The sharp loss of the new SL summicron is about the optical impression of the difference of sharpness and blur. But if you look at how thick the spots are in the background shooting wide open, then a Summilux is still a difference. After so many comparisons here and elsewhere, it's good to have heard it out of his mouth. And I continue to use my M-Summilux lenses. It\u2019s the hour of the wide open shooter: Peter Karbe wants a monitor that shows a message when stopping down: \u201cAre you really sure?\u201d All lens performance ambitions are wide open. \"Whoever photographs with 8 should take a smaller sensor. APSC is also the better sensor if you need DOF images. And more: \u201cInstead of stopping down, a ND filter can do in full format\u201d. Laughter. Alan Greenspan of optics. Finally, the Q&A time. And it's a pleasure to see how smart the audience is asking. Nobody asks directly for future plans. And so the event becomes valuable, even if the answers are like the ones that once Alan Greenspan gave as market outlook. The question of general product strategy and whether Leica leaves the very fast lenses to other manufacturers like the one with the \u201eS\u201c: \u201cWhen we make some faster lenses I cannot say. Now we have this project.\u201d To ask if that would mean that they finally would come once - no answer. The question of cooperation with the L-mount \u2013 he makes clear that this is not cooperation, but the opening up of Leica\u2019s own mount and thus opening the market, in order to enable other good companies making good L-lenses. No question of whether extenders come of course \u2013 but whether they are technically feasible at this high level. The answer makes everything clear to me. \u201cWith an extender, CA will also be magnified. An optical extender would be less good than a digital crop today. So, actually, we don't need it anymore.\u201c And: \u201cExtender wouldn't be my ... [Smile and silence] \u2026 but I would never say we never make one.\u201c Understand? The Tilt-Shift question is next: \u201cI may not and cannot answer that.\u201d The number of these lenses by other producers should lead to a realistic view here. A long telephoto lens? Of course he would like to make a long tele, he says, but if at all, and if so, when \u2013 he really doesn't know. Then it comes: \u201cWhy don't you use the 90-280 and crop it?\u201c And Sigma is a good company as well. The question of whether there\u2019s no demand for macro lenses anymore - here he makes a purchase recommendation: \u201cprobably there is further demand. I also recommend the EIpro-lens. Thank you anyway for that point. I'll pass it on.\u201d He's showing his own macro photos. I think he'd enjoy developing a macro. That's all I could get out. This friendly modest anti-guru makes us astonished again: He's just doing JPEG because he's too lazy to work on LR he says. Culture clash for a notorious DNG nerd like me. And besides, he's still using an M8. Among others I guess. That\u2019s what I noted. Unfortunately I\u2019ve got nothing about OIS and IBIS \u2013 sorry for that. Maybe because I\u2019m not that focussed on that topic and other participants remember more about it. Anyway \u2013 listening to Peter Karbe is informative and enjoyable. Actually, Leica should clone him and thus save a lot of glory marketing expenses.", "link":

My name is Ka\u00efs, french photographer based in Paris, France. I started my Leica journey with a M9, ten years ago, sold and upgraded with a M9-P A Monochrom (version 1) quickly followed him all of them bought brand new. Wanting to get my hands on a \"real Leica\", I bought a M6 Titanium set with its Summicron 35/1.4. The medium lust was too hard to resist: a S2 with a Summarit 70 joined my stable. Let's add a wide angle to my S system: a brand new Summarit 35. Time has past, I added a M7 (0.58 finder), a Q Titanium, a Monochrom version 2, a M5, an Elmarit 90/2.0, a Summicron 50, a Summarit 35/2.4... We are talking about minimum 44 500\u20ac (including the S007)!!!!! Then, the problems begun: both my M9-P and Monochrom I had a sensor failure (cracked sensor). How come a \"pro\" camera could have a sensor cracked? During my carreer, I owned a 5DmkII, a D3x, a Df, a 5DmkIV (I'm still using today) that NEVER failed me, NEVER. Anyways, Leica has been kind enough to replace both sensors for free. When the S007 came out, I was tempted to upgrade my aging S2. At my usual Leica dealer, they kindly checked my S2 before it goes on sale and discovered a corroded sensor! Come on! A third failure from a so serious comapany? I must be the unluckiest photographer on earth then. Still, I upgraded to a reconditioned mint grade SOO7, checked by Leica with a one year guarantee. During my second shooting, the 70 started to rattle from time to time, missing focus lock. Of course, my poker face never let any worries showed to my clients. Back home, I uploaded the photos into Capture One and got struck by what I have discovered (picture attached). I thought my memory card failed (I exclusively use hi-speed Sandisk Extreme and Extreme Pro SD). I tried with different cards, same problem. The DNGs are available if requested. I met the people of Leica at Paris Salon de la photo (photoshow) and, after hours of friendly chat, they acknowledged that there was a video card failure. Wait a second. Are we talking about Leica's flagship camera here? The one that is supposed to compete with a Hasselblad HD6-50 or a PhaseOne XF??? A failure after less than 2000 photos taken? Is this german so-called excellence? Since November 8th, 2018 my SOO7 is at the customer service (I hope) and I have NO NEWS from them!!! How come a pro photographer can trust such miserable products????? How come my 2400\u20ac 5DmkIV works like a charm after litteraly thousands and thousands of photos??? How come it takes 10 days max to Canon to fix and upgrade the firmware of their pro camera when I have been waiting 6+ months to get any information from Wetzlar??? I'm over with this overrated brand. Keep on releasing limited edition for rich Qataris and Russians and let the pros (Canon, Nikon, Hasselblad, Fuji, to name a few) run the photography business. SHAME ON YOU Leica to ignore and disrespect your loyal customers!!! We made you, never forget that. I sent them a letter and I know the drill: they will send me apologies.

In this old post is the test I made using my Coolscan V ED and my Canon 5D2 with the 100L macro. In this test the camera pulled more from the negative than the scanner. That can be a good or a bad thing. Typically for my workflow I aim to get as lifeless, flat and boring a scan as I am able to in order to preserve flexibility for the post-processing (this is why I wrote somewhat sloppily below that the camera was 'close' to the V ED). In my experience a sharper file may not withstand post-processing so well as I prefer to sharpen in at least two later stages, sharpening before finalising an image for computer/internet viewing and final sharpening before printing. But for a straight out of the camera file the digitized result was, I think, very good. There is a great convenience in having digital ICE even though it does soften images a bit. I am no longer using the V ED or my Coolscan 9000 but that function saved me lots of time. Since a while back I have switched to a Flextight X1, which doesn't have digital ICE. Flexcolor's Flextouch function doesn't work well enough for me but with proper cleaning of negs (Ilford's Antistaticum is a must) dust-spotting is usually not very time-consuming for a 2000-3000 dpi file. An X1 scan at full resolution will however reveal literally every bloody little thing on the neg which is in equal measure extremely impressive and extremely frustrating so I only scan at full resolution when absolutely necessary. I'm sure that in the future I will switch to digitising using a suitable camera rig. My main concern at present is that it would require stitching anything larger than 35mm film and I am not very keen on that. So for now I stick with my scanners even though I have the 5D2 and the macro lens. I think it is a very positive sign that just in the last year or two the number of sites and forum threads for instance here and at RFF showing various ways to digitize has increased very much. So there are a lot of people out there who try this out and come up with very creative solutions, both in terms of equipment, rigs and ways to post-process (including \"getting rid\" of the orange mask on C41). On this note just a friendly piece of advice to the OP. Since there are quite a lot of us in this forum in particular who are testing and trying out things just like you don't discount the forum as such only because views contrary to your own are expressed. br Philip On 4/30/2019 at 12:39 PM, philipus said: I love using my film scanners but I also like digitizing and have tested it with 135 film obtaining results which are close to my Coolscan V ED. I'm under no illusion that at some point old scanners will not be the basis for a viable workflow so anything that tests new ways to stick with film is good imho. Just a few suggestions, if I may - to better show quality differences you might consider using less contrasty images, as well as adding a few colour images.

I\u2019m posting here for feedback, in case anybody of you would like to test the application (with the M9) and show the results and your opinions. I usually shoot film photography but also I like the comfort of digital. The problem is that I\u2019ve never been happy with existing film emulations. Mainly because of that, because they are emulations instead of simulations. METHOD USED For doing so, instead of doing a generic conversion for every camera, I\u2019ve done a specialised conversion for the Leica M9 based on simulating the chemical process and spectrum response, instead of applying curves and other stuff. In the end, I thought, if analog and digital are just two instruments which capture light, I thought, maybe is there any mathematical conversion to make the digital to look like film? I mean, if I take the same photo with analog and digital, under exact same conditions (light / aperture / exposition /\u2026) could I make them look exactly the same? It\u2019s based on chemical simulation and the Leica M9\u2019s response to spectrum. Then LUTs and finally some extra calibration. I think that it could be improved because I\u2019ve used home made or open source tools for calibrating and so on, which are far from perfect. EXAMPLES (Analog vs Converted Digital) Following are some examples of Superia 200 and TriX 400. Click in each photo to see high resolution. DNGs shoots taken with Leica M9 (left), and FILM shoots taken with Minolta CLE (right) at same conditions (aperture / exposition / ISO). All shoots taken with Zeiss Biogon T* ZM 35mm f/2. The examples show several photos, which are the following:+------------------------+------------------------+ | original DNG | | +------------------------+------------------------+ | converted DNG | scanned FILM | +------------------------+------------------------+ | developed DNG | developed FILM | +------------------------+------------------------+ For the generated simulated negative TIFF file and the scanned TIFF file I\u2019ve applied exactly the same develop parameters. TriX 400 - 1 TriX 400 - 2 TriX 400 - 3 Superia 200 - 1 Superia 200 - 2 Superia 200 - 3 Superia 200 - 4 Superia 200 - 5 Superia 200 - 6 CONCLUSIONS Tonal range - Biggest difference between digital and film Dynamic range - Digital is faaar more detailed in the blacks, film never gets burnt, meanwhile digital gets burn quite fast. Film has more microcontrast, it's more sharpen Digital is a little bit more contrast after developing, I imagine it\u2019s because it reach white level faster, then, when doing autolevels with the developing program, as a result, it\u2019s a more contrast image. DOWNLOAD I'm having a console application ready, if interest is shown it will be ready quite soon! CAVEHEATS / LIMITATIONS The program only accept DNG, because I need all the light captured by the camera, instead of a JPG already converted and really dependent on camera self made adjustments. The program only accepts photos taken at the ISO of the certain film that is gonna be used. For example, for TriX400 it will accept only Leica M9 DNGs at 400 ISO. I\u2019ve also done tests with ISO 200 and 800, and the results were quite satisfactory but, for complexity reasons, I prefer to let it be native film ISO for the moment. Highlights are not always correct, and sometimes they look weird, mainly in color film. This is due to bayer sensor pattern and its different intensity response (for Red, Green and Blue channels).

If the date of the file does not yet have a folder, one is created. (as in, new photos for the day) I have an external hard drive which is actually an M.2 drive in a small USB-C cage, 1 tb. My folder structure on this drive is by year, month, day. 2019 > April > 04-20-2019. Etc I slide my camera card into my Satechi base while lightroom is open. Lightroom automatically moves to import screen. Most times, the last selected folder is still selected (M.2 > 2019 > April) If the files on the card are new, as in there is no \"date\" folder yet, one is created automagically and I can see it on the right column with a check mark in front of it. If files also exist on the card for another date, as in yesterday, then those files will be marked to go into the correct date folder. Once I verify by visually just looking (sometimes lightroom will try to put the files on my computers hard drive, and I have to remind it that this is not what I want by selecting the correct \"month\" folder on my m.2), I simply click import. I have mine setup to also show jpegs aside the DNG files, which are always B&W. I wait. Once done, I eject the card, remove the card, and it goes back into the camera. Next time I turn on the camera, or in the next few days, I reformat the card in camera. Usually while the import is happening, I'm already flagging keepers. Once the import is done, I continue to mark keepers and obvious rejects using the thumbnail strip. If the photo merits a deeper look, as in I can't tell from the thumbnail, it gets flagged white no matter. After this first run, I double check rejects, and delete them also removing from disk. Then in the develop module, I narrow down to only white flags, and arrow key through them seeking photos to take out of the flagged list. similar images, poor framing, over or under exposed, just not strong enough, that sort of stuff. once done, I next go image by image and 5 star my absolute favorites. Also in this step, I make a decision if this photo should be color or B&W. Also in this step, I identify any \"series\" of photos that should be processed similar. I love series of photos, and I want them to look the same as each other. From there, I edit. Once complete, CMD A, export, jpg 75%, long side 2080px, include copyright and they all export to a single folder titled EXPORT. This folder is kept clean and empty. I then open photos, drag the exports into PHOTOS, they import to my iCloud, and I move the exports to a subfolder titled OLD. Once per month I usually empty this OLD folder, I can't tell you why I don't do it right away... Usually once per month, I will export some previous month as it's own catalog, and then back that catalog and photos to a NAS, which in turn automatically backs up to a cloud service. I make a duplicate copy of same on an additional external hard drive. Then I remove those same photos from lightroom and from my M.2 drive, other wise it would be full in a hurry.

(as in, new photos for the day) i have an external hard drive which is actually an m.2 drive in a small usb-c cage, 1 tb. my folder structure on this drive is by year, month, day. 2019 > april > 04-20-2019. etc i slide my camera card into my satechi base while lightroom is open. lightroom automatically moves to import screen. most times, the last selected folder is still selected (m.2 > 2019 > april) if the files on the card are new, as in there is no \"date\" folder yet, one is created automagically and i can see it on the right column with a check mark in front of it. if files also exist on the card for another date, as in yesterday, then those files will be marked to go into the correct date folder. once i verify by visually just looking (sometimes lightroom will try to put the files on my computers hard drive, and i have to remind it that this is not what i want by selecting the correct \"month\" folder on my m.2), i simply click import. i have mine setup to also show jpegs aside the dng files, which are always b&w. i wait. once done, i eject the card, remove the card, and it goes back into the camera. next time i turn on the camera, or in the next few days, i reformat the card in camera. usually while the import is happening, i'm already flagging keepers. once the import is done, i continue to mark keepers and obvious rejects using the thumbnail strip. if the photo merits a deeper look, as in i can't tell from the thumbnail, it gets flagged white no matter. after this first run, i double check rejects, and delete them also removing from disk. then in the develop module, i narrow down to only white flags, and arrow key through them seeking photos to take out of the flagged list. similar images, poor framing, over or under exposed, just not strong enough, that sort of stuff. once done, i next go image by image and 5 star my absolute favorites. also in this step, -----> i !!!  -----> make !!!  a decision if this photo should be color or b&w. also in this step, i identify any \"series\" of photos that should be processed similar. i love series of photos, and i want them to look the same as each other. from there, i edit. once complete, cmd a, export, jpg 75%, long side 2080px, include copyright and they all export to a single folder titled export. this folder is kept clean and empty. i then open photos, drag the exports into photos, they import to my icloud, and i move the exports to a subfolder titled old. once per month i usually empty this old folder, i can't tell you why i don't do it right away... usually once per month, i will export some previous month as it's own catalog, and then back that catalog and photos to a nas, which in turn automatically backs up to a cloud service. i make a duplicate copy of same on an additional external hard drive. then i remove those same photos from lightroom and from my m.2 drive, other wise it would be full in a hurry. so at the end of april, i might be backing january. further, my entire computer, including attached drives, are all backed up automatically to another cloud service. when did this get so complicated?? haha edited april 25, 2019 by justbananas", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 111475, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "fotografr", "date": "2019-05-18 19:48:00", "content": "On 6/16/2014 at 5:40 AM, Steve Ash said: For myself I wish I could find a way to efficiently select the keepers to get the confidence to erase the rest.

As I already own an Olympus Pen-F (the digital one) I immediately had a sincere case of buyers remorse as those cameras are pretty redundant. So I returned the Fuji to the shop the next day. They took it back but refused to refund the money and gave credit instead. Damn it, dead money... About two weeks ago, I was pretty frustrated and went back to the shop to cash in my credit for something I could make use of. The dealer suggested a Nikon Z6. I didn't want to buy it right away so I had a good night of sleep and returned the next day to get it. And why not? From what I read and saw it is a damn good camera for almost any application at a ridiculously low price. Clearly a step up from my MicroFourThirds toy. And helping Nikon survive - \"oh, what's that???\" I swear it wasn't there the day before. The most beautiful camera I ever saw: a Leica M6! Well, it says \"Leitz\" on the dot. And it looks like new. My god, I'm in love, its a good price, I need a lens, Leica lenses are kinda expensive, I gotta feed my family, pay the mortgage, pay taxes, ooops, \"Thanks!

After I picked up the camera once it returned, the touch screen does not work. I contacted to Leica Camera AG again. They have asked me to send it in \"again\" so I packed all the camera in the box included with all accessories and took it to my local Leica store (I live in Thailand) and told them that I am not happy at all and I don't wish to get this camera back. I've asked them to find the best solution for me. If I am not happy, I will sue them. That is the way I solve the problem. (now I am still waiting as of 20190605). Now I haven't used my camera for 5 months already and it's counting. If you want to take your camera to service, it will cost you 4 months at least and not sure that you will get another problem back or not. RIP Leica warranty service for premium goods. Will come back again when I get any updates.

Despite what the manual and others say, the Panasonic Rep I talked to said leave it on, even using a tripod, as it reduces micro-vibrations. Both OIS and IBIS only really need to activate with a shutter press, so leave it set to 'Half Press'. No idea what the advantage of 'always on' is to be honest. I think the main power hogs are driving the EVF and LCD, so settings that shut these down quickly and put the camera to sleep have more consumption benefits.

It is hard to replicate the way that images look on large sensors/areas of film. The 110mm F2 on film has a look which is absolutely lovely, as do many of the FE lenses. I think the S lenses have some of the same magic and are certainly better technically, but sometimes I wish I could get a film version of the S...I imagine there is enough image circle for 645...a roll film version of the S would be unbelievable.

That said, they are still like looking through a TV, and I think that is just inherent in the technology. They apply the camera settings, which means the color profiles, exposure settings, white balance and screen information, all of which are an interpretation of the scene, rather than a direct transmission of it. The OVF experience will always be reflected light, either directly in a rangefinder, or reflected off a mirror. EVF's will never be able to replicate that perfectly, nor would they ever really aspire to, as they are showing you the output of the sensor, not the image of the actual scene. It can be very effectively argued that seeing the output of the sensor can be more helpful, as you see a closer approximation of the final result, but I would rather work with the scene as it actually appears. Because of that, I tend to prefer SLR's, Rangefinders and view cameras. I have made my peace with the EVF in the S1, but I primarily use that with video where seeing the output is much more critical (since post processing is not generally done from RAW in these kinds of cameras, and post processing is so much more onerous...you kind of have to get it right in camera).

Warning: what follows is all wild speculation on my part \ud83d\ude42 So basically we just need a light-tight box and a mechanism to insert and transport roll film - of which we'd waste quite a lot of real estate - and then we would need a Leica S mount on this light-tight box and we'd be good to go. Of course there would be no way to measure the light, control exposure and composition and check focus, which is why we would need separate light- and distance-meters and luckily we have a distance window on our S lenses. Not extremely accurate, but you know, it\u2019s just low-res film anyway (just kidding) Composition could be checked by something like a Sony RX0 that we could glue on top of the camera. Of course we\u2019d still need some electronics to control the shutter and and the aperture on the lens ... Some different options: - My best plan: get Sony to make 30 x 45 mm translucent mirror reflecting 0,5-0,75 stops of light to a 5-10 MP sensor that would give us all the information we need in an electronic viewfinder, of course with a fast processor on board the camera to control on sensor PDAF, exposure and all that. We could use the basic S camera design for this and place the translucent mirror where the flapping mirror is now. - Another route and probably the easiest way would be to get someone to make an adapter for the Minolta or CaNikon mount film-DSLRs of yore and be done with it, but then we're stuck to small format. - Use the basic S design with mirror box and all but put a film transport mechanism where the sensor is now. This could be roll film or small format so we could make some kind of mini Hasselblad X-Pan with 24x45mm. - Somehow use the L-Mount all the way into the corners and get a 30x45mm negative and have lots of other lens options available for analog shooting?

Interesting juxtaposition of buildings here including the ladder and drain pipes. The 42mm lens really shines in a photo like this.Also your exposure is spot on. I think that Tri-X is a perfect film for the UR Replica Sorry about the mixup about the film. As for you shutter curtain repair, remember that the diameter of the shutter drum with wound on shutter curtain is critical! When one collapses the lens there is a very small gap between the lens barrel stop and the barrel with shutter curtain. As long as your repairs were not in the middle of the curtain, there will be no problem. As a general rule I always advance the film, thus decreasing the shutter drum diameter, before I collapse the lens into the body. In this way you minimize the chance of rubbing the lens barrel stop flange against the shutter curtain. If this happens, you will see a little of the copper as a smudge on the curtain material. This was one of the challenges that Mr. Kim had with the first UR Replica that he made. The space inside the camera body is very limited. This is especially true with the shutter barrel. Mr. Kim made a few barrels before he got the diameter right. Even then he warned me to be very careful when collapsing the the lens into the body. A smaller diameter shutter curtain barrel was not possible as there is a critical spring inside the barrel. The small diameter of the shutter barrel also minimized the chance of shutter bounce and also since inertia was minimized, there was little lag in the acceleration of the shutter when you press the shutter button.

I think it is not so much the film that is the problem, it is the ways that we make it into a digital file that are the issue. With E6 it is not so bad, as you have a slide that you can look at and see the proper colors as a reference. Scanners also have an easier time getting natural color out of slides. But for color negative there is no real \"correct\" image...it is always an interpretation of the scanned data. The difficulty with color negative is that while RA4 paper has been designed to render a good neutral baseline for the film, when you scan it, you have to account for the orange mask. Scanners and cameras have a much harder time of it, as they have not been designed to deal with it. A simple inversion of the negative will yield extremely blue/cyan images. While you can just try to compensate for it in photoshop, there is more going on than just white balance, so special software can help, be it the scanner software itself, or third party programs like I mentioned. In my experience, ColorPerfect gives the best baseline image in most cases. It is a bit counter-intuitive to use, but it seems to get the most natural colors in one click as compared to FlexColor (which I use in the X5), Negative Lab Pro (which I downloaded as a trial).
