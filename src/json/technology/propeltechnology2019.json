In bridges there are expansion joints to allow it to expand and shrink without compromising the structural integrity. The Hyperloop will require thermal expansion joints to function. Installing the joints on bridges is easy enough, however, they do not need to maintain a seal holding back billions of kilograms of force.\n\nPhil Mason predicts the Hyperloop will require a joint every 100 meters. Over the entire distance, it would accumulate 6000 moving vacuum seals - all of which are a significant point of failure.\n\n\"A failure on any one of them would be disastrous to everyone inside\"\u00a0 Phil Mason - [*The Hyperloop Busted Video.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNFesa01llk)\n\n#### Pressure\n\nA proposed Hyperloop of 600 km with a diameter of about two meters,\u00a0 will maintain a surface area of about four million meters squared. Given one square meter will experience 10,000 kg of force, the Hyperloop will have to endure nearly 40 billion kilograms of force over its entire surface.\n\nA small compromise in the structure of the tube would result in a catastrophic implosion. If the tube became punctured, external air would tear into the tube, shredding it apart as it violently rushes in to fill the void. -[ *Interesting Engineering - June 29th, 2017*](https://interestingengineering.com/biggest-challenges-stand-in-the-way-of-hyperloop)\n\n#### G-Force and Illness\n\nElon Musk's planned route is designed to limit lateral G-forces to a maximum of 0.5 Gs.\n\nAccording to James Powell PhD that\u2019s a problem: \"In all our tests, we found people started to feel nauseous when you went above 0.2 lateral Gs.\" The closest comparison would be roller coasters, which usually top out around half a G \u2014 but the Hyperloop wouldn't just peak at 0.5; it would stay there for the duration of the curve. The result would be well short of blackout, which most studies peg around 4.7 lateral Gs, but it would make the Hyperloop challenging for the faint of stomach.
