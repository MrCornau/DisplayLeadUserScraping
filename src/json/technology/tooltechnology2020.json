\u201cif they would ever consider to remove all the locks on their homes and online\u201d.`\n\n`clearly, this is not\u2026 \u201cfor the children\u201d`\n\n`thank you for your time.`\n\n`sincerely,`\n\n`|//////|`\n\ni want to preface again perhaps my writing is too \"simplistic\". and perhaps i should have prefaced it with \"as a u.s. citizen and resident of your state\". perhaps the eff correspondence is \"just right\".\n\nregardless, please check how many representatives you personally are able to contact. attempt to contact them directly. and cut and paste or rewrite passages as you see fit. as a u.s. citizen who files taxes and pays the salaries of these individuals and government.\n\nhonestly, we may have to print out, sign, address the envelops, affix the stamp and use the postal service.\n\nwe have a (still) have a right to have our voices heard. thank you all.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 1, "media": "('self',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/fuadan/how_to_write_a_proper_letter_about_s_3398_the/',)", "identifyer": 5519153, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "gulabjamunyaar", "date": 1585917320000, "content": "Automated tool can find 100 Zoom meeting IDs per hour", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/fu7n0c/automated_tool_can_find_100_zoom_meeting_ids_per/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "automated -----> tool !!!  can find 100 zoom meeting ids per hour", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "media": "('link',)", "medialink": "('https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206061/zoom-meeting-id-zwardial-automated-tool',)", "identifyer": 5519191, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "hildebrand_rarity", "date": 1586554371000, "content": "Verizon\u2019s new tracking tool tells advertisers when you\u2019re looking at your email inbox", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/fypc2f/verizons_new_tracking_tool_tells_advertisers_when/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "verizon\u2019s new tracking -----> tool !!!  tells advertisers when you\u2019re looking at your email inbox", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 11, "media": "('link',)", "medialink": "('https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216932/verizon-email-ads-view-time-optimization-marketing-privacy',)", "identifyer": 5519640, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "paul1032xx", "date": 1586540540000, "content": "Apple and Google Are Building a Virus Tracking Tool for Phones", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/fykkr1/apple_and_google_are_building_a_virus_tracking/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "apple and google are building a virus tracking -----> tool !!!  for phones", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 2, "media": "('link',)", "medialink": "('https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html',)", "identifyer": 5519673, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "iammarksmith", "date": 1582152248000, "content": "A.I. translation tool sheds light on the secret language of mice", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/f6iv4x/ai_translation_tool_sheds_light_on_the_secret/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "a.i. translation -----> tool !!!  sheds light on the secret language of mice", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('moderator',)", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "media": "('link',)", "medialink": "('https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/ai-sheds-light-on-mouse-communication/',)", "identifyer": 5519825, "year": "2020"}, {"autor": "myharley12", "date": 1582010420000, "content": "How to quadruple your business using paid online advertising? /!/   \n\nPaid advertising is the best way to drive more traffic to your website &amp;

Review of IT-Outsourcing Trends Beyond 2020 /!/ Today, businesses in the IT sector turn to the services of outsourcing companies for a bunch of reasons: some are aiming to save money, striving to become more flexible in the world market that had sagged at the beginning of 2020, or just need to gain additional experience in a certain field. However, according to the Global Sourcing Association (GSA) report, in 2020 the trends in the IT outsourcing market are changing dramatically and such changes will be especially noticeable by 2021.\n\nPreviously, most companies perceived outsourcing exclusively as a tool to reduce costs. In 2020, this point of view is loosing popularity- as we enter a new decade, more and more often developers, system administrators or other members of the client\u2019s team cannot deal with emerging technologies and, as a consequence, fail to solve the rising problems. Unless you provide enough learning opportunities and regularly send your staff for training, your best employees will remain at least one step behind the latest IT trends. So how can your team deal with something they don\u2019t quite understand?\n\nTherefore, IT outsourcing clients today are starting to focus on the effectiveness of the team, rather than on cost savings. Besides, more frequently the client looks for an outsourcing company that will not be just an executor, but become a professional partner interested the result of this cooperation and not so much in the process itself. Such a partner is willing to share both profit and loss with the client.\n\nOverall, despite various reasons for resorting to outsourcing, most businesses agree that improving the quality of service and finding new business opportunities, using an outsourcing partner attract them much more than just an opportunity to cut their monthly expenses and save money.\n\nAt the same time, in recent years, Customer Satisfaction Score with the results of cooperating with outsourcing companies has been at a stable low. Customers believe that most IT outsourcing service providers today do not have sufficient flexibility and innovation.\n\nWe at Virtual Electronics believe that outsourcing service providers should take into account such moods among customers and try to carefully evaluate the level of customer focus of their company. This would help outsourcing companies increase their competitiveness, get additional contracts and, most importantly, avoid losing their business in today\u2019s market. Only leaders in their field and those businesses who do not resist accepting new rules of the game will prosper as they can rebuild and adapt quickly to the ever changing business environment. \u201cRebuild\u201d in this case will mean that your company accepting the fact that today competently built partnerships between outsource providers and their clients are no less important than the focus of your business on innovation.\n\nHowever, there is good news for outsourcing companies. Presently, we can already assume that the field of IT outsourcing will grow rapidly along with the number of companies seeking to delegate more tasks to third-party performers in order to limit the number of employees in the office (which will obviously become one global trend in 2020\u20132021).\n\nAnother notable trend in outsourcing in 2020\u20132021 is that narrow IT specialists are becoming an ever-growing shortage. This leads to increased demand for IT outsourcing, where even a very large company will turn to outsourcing in order to attract such rare personnel to solve the problems of a particular client or project. Among such specialists, for example, digital security managers, automation specialists, design thinking specialists, and so on, can be distinguished. Apart from that,, along with the active growth of projects in the field of AR/VR, the number of clients who are in search of specialists willing to work with such promising technologies and, most importantly, have enough expertise, is growing proportionally.. In addition, an important trend is the development of global competition among IT outsourcing companies. Where Chineese and Indian companies shared the market 5 years ago, a huge number of impressive Eastern-European players from Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Russia, and Romania had entered the present market.\n\n**To sum up:** In modern business world, IT outsourcing service providers must adapt to the trends of the ever changing market, carefully researching the needs of customers who are determined to work with companies practicing a customer-oriented approach. Such outsource providers offer the opportunity to transform the old form of their business relationships that looked like a \u201ccustomer-executor\u201d into a new \u201cpartner-partner\u201d form, where the provider of outsourcing IT services finds the courage to be proactive in sharing risks. Besides, a thoughtful intention to protect client\u2019s private data is becoming increasingly important in the field of technological outsourcing. The implementation of such strategies in all of your business processes, as well as keeping an eye on new trends in the field of outsourcing can become a reliable support and incentive for your company to develop over the next few years.\n\n[Virtual Electronics PTE LTD](http://virtualelectronics.sg/) is a Singapore based company specializing in IT outsourcing, mobile application development, and hosting solutions ([justvps.com](http://justvps.com/)).
