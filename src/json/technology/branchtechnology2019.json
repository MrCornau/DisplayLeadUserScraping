We blend visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when you want it without getting in the way of your creative process.

Want to work on the CSS that applies to a specific ID? Put your mouse cursor on that ID, push Command / Ctrl+S and Write-It will show you all the CSS selectors with that ID in an inline window so you can work on your code side-by-side without any popups.\n\n# Great for Testing &amp; Previews\n\nGet a real-time connection to your browser or app. Make changes to CSS and HTML and you'll instantly see those changes on screen. Also see where your CSS selector is being applied in the browser/app by simply putting your cursor on it. It's the power of a code editor with the convenience of in-browser/app dev tools.\n\n# Preprocessor Support\n\nWork with preprocessors in a whole new way.

The piece that's taken for translation can be something such as a prescription for medication or a doctor's diagnosis or something else medical related. A code for each and every event is created, these events can be of injuries, diagnosis or medical procedures.\n\nPresently, there are about a hundred thousand codes existing that are used for medical procedures, outpatient procedures, and diagnoses. Let us have a look at a simple example of Medical Coding:\n\nLet's say that a patient has walked into a doctor\u2019s office and he/she is coughing tirelessly, they have a high production of mucus, and have a dreaded fever. Then a nurse walks up to the patient and asks them their symptoms, once the symptoms are noted, she performs some initial tests to get an idea of what is actually going on, and then comes the doctor who analyzes and concludes the diagnoses saying that the patient is suffering from bronchitis. A medication is then prescribed to the patient by the doctor.\n\nNow comes the interesting part of Modern Healthcare, each and every part of the visit is recorded by the clinic be it the doctor or someone in the office who is authorized to carry out such operations. Then begins the coders job that is to translate all of relevant information of the visit into numeric and alphanumeric codes, which are ultimately used in the billing process.\n\nThe medical coder should be equipped with the knowledge of a few sets and subsets of code, let's take two of the subsets: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) these codes correspond to a patient\u2019s injury or sickness, and Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) that are related to the functions and services Healthcare providers perform to the patient this can be as performing on them and performing for them.\n\nA task included for the Medical Coders is to translate every bit of data or information of the patient's visit to the clinic and shape it in the form of a code. There are different codes for different kinds of visits, some codes are more specific these specific codes can be such as the patients symptoms, the tests performed by the doctor and the diagnosis procedure used by the doctor.\n\nThe Medical Coders have to keep these guidelines in mind, they are very important and can affect the status of a claim. The coding process concludes when the Medical Coder has entered the proper codes into the for or software program. This is where the job of the Medical Coder ends, now, all of this is passed on to the Medical Biller.\n\n### MEDICAL BILLING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Medical Biller more so acts as a middleman between patients, healthcare providers and the insurance companies. Their job, is on similar lines in context to the Medical Coder. The Medical Biller translates the codes given by the Medical Coder into a financial report, they make sure that the Healthcare Provider has been reimbursed appropriately for the services they've provided.\n\nDo not be fooled by the simplicity of the term \"Medical Billing\", it may seem that all the Medical Billers task is to make a bill (Commonly known as a 'Claim') for the insurance company by the help of the information provided by the Medical Coder, the reality of the process is not as simple.\n\nContinuing with the previous example, the Medical Biller now looks at the codes, that consist of information of things such as the kind of visit, the symptoms, the diagnosis of the doctor, the medication prescribed by the doctor and then creates a Claim. The Claim is then sent and evaluated by the insurance company, and then returned back. The bill of the patient is then made by biller who carefully re-evaluates the returned claim after the insurance is removed, all of these tasks are performed through a form or software, they're called as [Medical Billing Software Solutions](https://www.osplabs.com/medical-billing-solutions/) and there's a large number of companies out there creating such solutions.\n\nThe biller takes a few factors into account such as the insurance plans of the patient into account while creating the bill, this ensures that an accurate bill is produced. In cases where the patient shows signs refraining the bill payment, the Medical Biller has to take appropriate steps to ensure healthcare provider is properly compensated.\n\n# Let's take a look at how a Traditional Medical Billing &amp; Coding Process Flows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking about the word 'Traditional' you must have got an idea that it requires **ALOT** of manual documentation and paper work, the average time for a traditional coding and billing process stretched on to about 5-7 weeks whereas in the modern automated system the process is reduced to as low as 2 weeks.\n\nFollowing is a Claim-to-Payment Chase while using a traditional Paper-Based System.\n\n1. Patient visits the doctor\u2019s office.\n2. Patient check-in, gets treated.\n3. Doctor or their assistant writes a superbill for the treatment.\n4. The Medical Coder writes codes for the treatment.\n5. Medical Billers receive Paper forms who then format the data and forward it to insurance payers.\n6. Payer generates check and send payment to the provider.\n\nNow the point where AI fits into the story is to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of the billing and coding process. *Computer Assisted Coding (CAC) is a technology that works on the concept of Machine Learning (ML) which is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP),* they provide automated

Made a comment on the main post, figured I\u2019ll branch it into its own thread and go into a bit more detail.\n\nBasically, losing the Enterprise App rights will impact bug and feature testing noticeably on iOS. However, moreso than that, it also impacts the daily operations of employees, which is where things will be getting even more fucky.\n\nIn short, every employee at Facebook, be it Developer, Human Resources, Janitor, Security Guard, or Chef has these internal apps. There\u2019s one for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, there was one for Oculus IIRC. These apps were all the development builds for the apps. Anytime a test build was released, we had it. It was really cool because it meant everyone had a hand in testing out the features before they launch.\n\nHowever, it goes beyond that. We also had apps for Bus Routes, Menus at the Cafeterias, an FB appstore, and an app for a company wiki used primarily for bug tracking, employee resources, and the like. If the enterprise app permission is revoked, they potentially lose all of those resources.\nSadly for employees, there\u2019s a lot of reliance on the internal apps for day-to-day use (I know the food app was a godsend when figuring out lunch plans) I would imagine this would have a huge shitshow on their end if they lose this resource.\n\nNow, they also had these apps for Android, so it\u2019s not the end of the world.
