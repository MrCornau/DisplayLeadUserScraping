While the technology has positive applications\u2014 Walt Disney Co. has used algorithms to insert characters in some of its \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies\u2014it also has been used to create more nefarious content.\n\nThe tools to create the fake images are improving so rapidly that \u201cvery soon it will be very hard to detect deepfakes with technology,\u201d said Dana Rao, executive vice president and general counsel for Adobe Inc., the San Francisco company best known for Photoshop image-editing software. The fight \u201cwill be an arms race,\u201d he said.\n\nThe number of deepfakes online nearly doubled from December to August, to 14,678, according to a study by cybersecurity startup Deeptrace. The rise has prompted action by tech giants.\n\nAlphabet Inc. \u2019s Google on Wednesday, in an update to its political advertisement policy, said it was prohibiting the use of deepfakes in those and other ads.\n\nComputer-generated videos are getting more realistic and even harder to detect thanks to deep learning and artificial intelligence. As WSJ\u2019s Jason Bellini finds in this episode of Moving Upstream, these so-called deepfakes can be playful, but can also have real, damaging consequences for people\u2019s lives.\n\nTwitter earlier this month said it was considering identifying manipulated photos, videos and audio shared on its platform. \u201cThe risk is that these types of synthetic media and disinformation undermine the public trust and erode our ability to have productive conversations about critical issues,\u201d said Yoel Roth, Twitter\u2019s head of site integrity.\n\nFacebook, Microsoft Corp. and [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. are working with more than a half-dozen universities to run a Deepfake Detection Challenge starting next month. It is intended to accelerate research into new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated to mislead others, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a blog post in September.\n\nInterest in making deepfakes is growing fast, according to Deeptrace. Two years ago the first deepfakes appeared on Reddit, the popular chat forum. Now at least 20 websites and online forums are devoted to discussions about how to better produce them.\n\nDeeptrace found online services that can generate and sell custom deepfakes in as little as two days and for a cost as low as $2.99 a video, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of skill,\u201d said Matt Turek, a program manager overseeing deepfake-related research and development efforts at the Pentagon\u2019s technology incubator, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The Pentagon is studying deepfakes out of concern that military planners could be fooled into bad decisions if altered images aren\u2019t detected.\n\nDarpa has developed a prototype media forensics tool for use by government agencies to detect altered photos and video. It wants to develop additional technology to detect synthetic audio and fake text and identify the source and intent of any manipulated content.\n\nHow companies deal with deepfakes is another point of conflict between tech companies and Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) denounced Facebook earlier this year for its refusal to take down a doctored video of her. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, following the incident, said the company was reviewing its policy on deepfakes.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas has co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D., Nev.) to boost research to identify such content manipulation. On Wednesday, Mr. Moran called deepfakes \u201ca specific threat to U.S. voters and consumers by way of misinformation that is increasingly difficult to identify.\u201d\n\nSeveral startups have emerged to work on image verification, and now big tech companies, which have been criticized for not doing more to prevent disinformation, are getting more involved in the fight.\n\nFor example, Facebook has amassed more than 100,000 videos featuring actors\u2014not images drawn from the social media site\u2019s actual users\u2014that researchers can use to help develop and test systems to spot deepfakes.\n\nGoogle has similarly built up a catalog to hone deepfake-detection research. This year the company assembled a trove of audio clips to help researchers develop ways to identify fake speech that can be spliced into a video. Google also is drawing on its work developing text-to-speech conversion tools and to devise new ones that can help authenticate a speaker.\n\nAdobe is taking a different approach. The company has developed a system that will allow authors and publishers to attach information to content, such as who created it and when and where. It is working with New York Times Co. and Twitter and will share the technology, which it says it will aim to make an industrywide system for authenticating content.\n\nAdobe said it would introduce the authentication tool on its Photoshop editing software as an opt-in feature in the next several months. Adobe expects most legitimate authors and creators to opt in, while bad actors wouldn\u2019t, Mr. Rao said.\n\nElsewhere, the nonprofit arm of the AI Foundation, an advocacy group for the safe use of artificial intelligence, has created a website to help campaigns and journalists analyze photos and videos within minutes of receiving them. The portal, called Reality Defender 2020, uses complex algorithms to detect pixel changes and other anomalies, such as in a candidate\u2019s mannerisms, mouth movements, face wrinkles and shadows, to detect alterations. It has drawn on research from dozens of academics.\n\n\u201cThere is no one silver bullet,\u201d said the AI Foundation\u2019s founder and chief technology officer, Rob Meadows.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-companies-step-up-fight-against-deepfakes-11574427345](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-companies-step-up-fight-against-deepfakes-11574427345)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/e02oa3/tech_companies_step_up_fight_against_deepfakes/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "tech companies step up fight against \u2018deepfakes\u2019 google, twitter, facebook take action as the number of manipulated photos and images online has doubled this year /!/ big tech companies such as facebook inc., twitter inc. and google have benefited from enabling users to easily share pictures or videos, but they are now working to stem the spread of maliciously doctored content ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nso-called deepfakes are images or videos that have been manipulated through the use of sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to make it almost impossible to differentiate between what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. while the technology has positive applications\u2014 walt disney co. has used algorithms to insert characters in some of its \u201cstar wars\u201d movies\u2014it also has been used to create more nefarious content.\n\nthe tools to create the fake images are improving so rapidly that \u201cvery soon it will be very hard to detect deepfakes with technology,\u201d said dana rao, executive vice president and general counsel for adobe inc., the san francisco company best known for photoshop image-editing software. the fight \u201cwill be an arms race,\u201d he said.\n\nthe number of deepfakes online nearly doubled from december to august, to 14,678, according to a study by cybersecurity startup deeptrace. the rise has prompted action by tech giants.\n\nalphabet inc. \u2019s google on wednesday, in an update to its political advertisement policy, said it was prohibiting the use of deepfakes in those and other ads.\n\ncomputer-generated videos are getting more realistic and even harder to detect thanks to deep learning and artificial intelligence. as wsj\u2019s jason bellini finds in this episode of moving upstream, these so-called deepfakes can be playful, but can also have real, damaging consequences for people\u2019s lives.\n\ntwitter earlier this month said it was considering identifying manipulated photos, videos and audio shared on its platform. \u201cthe risk is that these types of synthetic media and disinformation undermine the public trust and erode our ability to have productive conversations about critical issues,\u201d said yoel roth, twitter\u2019s head of site integrity.\n\nfacebook, microsoft corp. and [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) inc. are working with more than a half-dozen universities to run a deepfake detection challenge starting next month. it is intended to accelerate research into new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated to mislead others, facebook chief technology officer mike schroepfer wrote in a blog post in september.\n\ninterest in making deepfakes is growing fast, according to deeptrace. two years ago the first deepfakes appeared on reddit, the popular chat forum. now at least 20 websites and online forums are devoted to discussions about how to better produce them.\n\ndeeptrace found online services that can generate and sell custom deepfakes in as little as two days and for a cost as low as $2.99 a video, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cit doesn\u2019t take a lot of skill,\u201d said matt turek, a program manager overseeing deepfake-related research and development efforts at the pentagon\u2019s technology incubator, the defense advanced research projects agency. the pentagon is studying deepfakes out of concern that military planners could be fooled into bad decisions if altered images aren\u2019t detected.\n\ndarpa has developed a prototype media forensics -----> tool !!!  for use by government agencies to detect altered photos and video. it wants to develop additional technology to detect synthetic audio and fake text and identify the source and intent of any manipulated content.\n\nhow companies deal with deepfakes is another point of conflict between tech companies and washington. house speaker nancy pelosi (d., calif.) denounced facebook earlier this year for its refusal to take down a doctored video of her. facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg, following the incident, said the company was reviewing its policy on deepfakes.\n\nrepublican sen. jerry moran of kansas has co-sponsored legislation with sen. catherine cortez masto (d., nev.) to boost research to identify such content manipulation. on wednesday, mr. moran called deepfakes \u201ca specific threat to u.s. voters and consumers by way of misinformation that is increasingly difficult to identify.\u201d\n\nseveral startups have emerged to work on image verification, and now big tech companies, which have been criticized for not doing more to prevent disinformation, are getting more involved in the fight.\n\nfor example, facebook has amassed more than 100,000 videos featuring actors\u2014not images drawn from the social media site\u2019s actual users\u2014that researchers can use to help develop and test systems to spot deepfakes.\n\ngoogle has similarly built up a catalog to hone deepfake-detection research. this year the company assembled a trove of audio clips to help researchers develop ways to identify fake speech that can be spliced into a video. google also is drawing on its work developing text-to-speech conversion tools and to devise new ones that can help authenticate a speaker.\n\nadobe is taking a different approach. the company has developed a system that will allow authors and publishers to attach information to content, such as who created it and when and where. it is working with new york times co. and twitter and will share the technology, which it says it will aim to make an industrywide system for authenticating content.\n\nadobe said it would introduce the authentication tool on its photoshop editing software as an opt-in feature in the next several months. adobe expects most legitimate authors and creators to opt in, while bad actors wouldn\u2019t, mr. rao said.\n\nelsewhere, the nonprofit arm of the ai foundation, an advocacy group for the safe use of artificial intelligence, has created a website to help campaigns and journalists analyze photos and videos within minutes of receiving them. the portal, called reality defender 2020, uses complex algorithms to detect pixel changes and other anomalies, such as in a candidate\u2019s mannerisms, mouth movements, face wrinkles and shadows, to detect alterations. it has drawn on research from dozens of academics.\n\n\u201cthere is no one silver bullet,\u201d said the ai foundation\u2019s founder and chief technology officer, rob meadows.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-companies-step-up-fight-against-deepfakes-11574427345](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-companies-step-up-fight-against-deepfakes-11574427345)", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "media": "('self',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/e02oa3/tech_companies_step_up_fight_against_deepfakes/',)", "identifyer": 5763500, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "CrankyBear", "date": 1559592173000, "content": "The guy who made a tool to track women in porn videos is sorry", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bwf9dp/the_guy_who_made_a_tool_to_track_women_in_porn/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "the guy who made a -----> tool !!!

This implies; exponential growth in data volume is going to proceed. This growth will increase further with the increase in IoT (Internet Of Things).\n\nData analytics mainly uses Big Data. It gives necessary insights into business operations of any business. It helps businesses in growth, competitiveness and profitability.\n\n## Need of Big Data \u2013\n\nThere are many challenges for handling a huge data in applications. Big data is no longer growing trend. This is now time-tested, accepted with a sound, secure, stable architecture. It is synchronized with information, generating efficient analytics by organizations, ranging from data oriented start-ups to big technology giants around the globe. There are many tools on the internet, there is considerably more to it than Big Data alone.\n\nIf you hold a large amount of various data, and from this you need to find out answers at fast, you may look at the opening gates called \u201cthe three V\u2019s\u201d of the data. This means that you are ready to look at better solutions that fulfils your need of data. Can you say that it is enough? Of course not.\n\nDo you want to turn your existing application asset to a bigger store for a theoretically possible performance? How big are your existing data security issues and how would you deal with the same on the new infrastructure? Is your data \u201cbig\u201d enough for these solutions? Such questions carry you to a point where you have to think about a couple of significant things. You realize that first, the idea of building an efficient big data infrastructure, lies the need to build a decision on whether to present a big data infrastructure or not.\n\n## Why you should need big data in an organization?\n\nOrganizations or businesses requires a big data services to allow them to survive in a fast growing and increasingly competitive market where the sources and the requirements to store data are growing at exponential manner. To handle high volumes, the data storage should be elastic and scalable. Cloud based storage is a better idea for most businesses because it reduces investments. There are no physical systems on site, means that it saves space and power consumption. It handles the data security issues. You require tools to enable virtualization and carry out data compression. You should require object-based storage architecture to handle a large amount of files. organizations are looking out for the solution that can store complex unstructured data and which do not have predefined schemas.\n\nBig Data solutions do not force a schema onto the stored data. Instead you can store any type of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data and then apply a suitable schema when you query this data. Big data solutions store data in raw format and apply a schema only when the data is read. This preserves all information within the data. This is contradictory to the way of traditional database.\n\n## Data Magnitude Determination-\n\nIn 1997, the first documented use of the term \u201cbig data\u201d appeared in paper by scientists at NASA. It describes the problem facing by them with visualization. Generally data sets are large, taxing the capacities of main memory, local disk and remote disk. This problem is Big Data. When there is a situation like data sets don\u2019t fit in main memory, or when they do not fit on local disk also, in such cases the solution is to acquire more resources.\n\nAnother most important factor is what you want to do with the data. The problem is big data solutions is that they are numerous. Getting the perfect tool is important for the cost, efficiency and delivery constraints also. Creating an understanding of these factors is a main requirement of big data infrastructure requirements.\n\n## Necessity of Advanced Analytics-\n\nAn interesting thing that gives thought on analytics is- one of the financial services firm which turned to big data to better identify which new client opportunities warrant the most investment. The organization enhanced its client statistic information with third party data purchased from eBureau. The data service provider appended sales lead opportunities with buyer\u2019s occupation, earnings, age, retail histories and also related factors. The advanced data set is then applied to an algorithm. This identifies which new client leads should receive additional investment and which should not. The result has been 11% hike in new client win rates. At the similar instance, the firm has lowered sales related expenses by 14.5%.\u00a0\n\nThere are some benefits that big data analytics offer are \u2013 Getting answers to complex business problems, creating cost effective requirements to bring in more customers, analyzing existing values to predict faster and better business decisions, and also exploiting machine learning analytics to make self learning systems.\n\n## Right time for data transition and security issues-\n\nData-driven transition must start with your business goals and also objectives. As you understand your business objectives then you are ready to create a roadmap for leveraging new data sources to help you achieve them. Also, technology is not only enough to transform your organization into a data-driven organization. Creating a platform that understands data, securing the data and how to use it is just as necessary.

bullshit. people are paid for \u201cwhat they have the power to negotiate\u201d. same with product prices! why can\u2019t we negotiate it in the shops? fixed prices are there not because companies can\u2019t afford to sell it cheaper, it\u2019s because they became more powerful than consumers! pretending to make us think this way! putting sales and discounts so we would do the hard work searching and running around.\n\nwe fight to create the new market for e-commerce, the \u201cright market\" for everyone and we have the -----> tool !!!  - [rvlhub.com](https://www.rvlhub.com) to do it, we are not doing it for the money, it\u2019s not for profit! it's the start of a big movement and we follow these principals:\n\n**- i can decide what i want to pay for my products/services**,   \ni can put my own price tag and make myself black fridays every day.i don\u2019t have to accept fixed prices in the shop. if i don\u2019t get what i want, i reject it all and let companies do the hard work again trying to offer me the best price.\n\n**- i can put a request deciding my own conditions**i   \ncan ask for eco-friendly products, support climate change companies or i can demand longer guarantees, faster delivery times etc. or else i don\u2019t buy! no money - no company power.\n\n**- let companies do the hard work for my hard-earned money**  \nlet them compete in a head to head direct competition with other companies for my requests. all i have to do is accept or reject. if i pay, they better work for my money.\n\n**- no more manipulation on consumer data**  \ncompanies can\u2019t see what i search, my age, my likes etc. no more data. i tell what i want and they give it to me!\n\nwe are 10k angry consumers and counting! join the change in our [e-commerce forum](https://rvlhub.wixsite.com/rvlhubforum)\n\nbest regards,\n\ntwo furious bankers  \n[www.rvlhub.com](http://www.rvlhub.com)", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 1, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/dr06xt/hi_we_are_two_furious_bankers_supporting_the_99/',)", "identifyer": 5780991, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "JASMINE-JAS", "date": 1555808534000, "content": "Ethics committee raises alarm over 'predictive policing' tool /!/  \n\nA computer tool used by police to predict which people are likely to reoffend has come under scrutiny from one force\u2019s ethics committee, who said there were a lot of \u201cunanswered questions\u201d and concerns about potential bias.\n\nAmid mounting financial pressure, at least a dozen police forces are using or considering predictive analytics, despite warnings from campaigners that use of algorithms and \u201cpredictive policing\u201d models risks locking discrimination into the criminal justice system.\n\nWest Midlands police are at the forefront, leading on a \u00a34.5m project funded by the Home Office called National Data Analytics Solution (NDAS).\n\nThe long-term aim of the project is to analyse data from force databases, social services, the NHS and schools to calculate where officers can be most effectively used.

It was the intention and belief, albeit retrospectively naive, that this powerful technology would unite us for the better good. In some ways, it has united us, but not for the betterment; not at this moment anyhow. It has united us into factions which have actually further separated us into warring factions. You don\u2019t like so and so\u2019s political views\u2026block them. You want to hear or read this? Let\u2019s put it at the top of your search. All of this algorithmic data collection has cyphered us into distant \u201cmobs,\u201d and into places on the internet where it is ok to be racist (see the Daily Stormer) and places you can\u2019t say \u201c[Bruce Jenner.\u201d (see Twitter)](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113344/twitter-trans-user-hateful-content-misgendering-deadnaming-ban)\n\nStrange times indeed. So, as Hunter S. Thompson said, \u201cWhere the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\u201d Well, I\u2019m going pro. Let\u2019s see how weird we can get. We are too far into this rabbit hole through the looking glass to go back now, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let Nora O\u2019Donnell or Sean Hannity spew their absurd partisan nonsense into the universe without getting mine. I will die with my boots on.\n\nIn America, you can be a racist asshole and be weirded out by sex changes. I\u2019m pretty sure both of those things are covered in the 1st amendment. That\u2019s the price we pay for free speech. We have to put up with hearing absurdities that we may not agree with as a whole. It is not the job of tech companies to police this. This is a job for the actual police. Yet, our state is being circumvented by people like me with a keyboard and a moderator privilege.\n\nThe government of old bald men have absolutely no idea what is going on, or what to do about it. Meanwhile, it\u2019s absolute chaos on the interwebs. People actually believe the earth is flat, which started out as a joke on 4chan. Ask your legislator if he even knows what 4chan is and I highly doubt they have a clue what you are talking about. But hell, people are allowed to believe that the earth is flat. I\u2019m just telling you that you\u2019ve been \u201ctrolled.\u201d If you don\u2019t know what\u00a0 troll is, imagine Mitch McConnell at age 20 getting rejected by his girlfriend and anonymously saying nasty things about her\u2026no wait that\u2019s too similar to the story of how Facebook started. A troll says anything to get\u00a0 reaction out of you, kind of like a drag-queen. You\u2019re either offended or you get it. If you\u2019re offended, well you have fallen into the free speech trap the troll has set for you.\n\nThe internet thrives on outrage. It\u2019s algorithms that support this. The algorithms, in many cases, move material that engages audiences to a higher level of visibility in you feed. Maybe you remember something known as the Arab Spring? Well, if not, about seven years ago, there were political uprisings in the middle east that sprang up due to Facebook and its algorithm that used engagement to rank posts. [This helped start revolutions, but it couldn\u2019t maintain them](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/social-media-made-the-arab-spring-but-couldnt-save-it/), as more fundamentalist and outrageous posts, sometimes sheer trolling, helped further the grip of discourse in the countries. Misinformation and trolling ran rampant, and what was once a free for all became a tool to strengthen dictatorship. Elections and opinion could be guided or misguided by this algorithmic flaw.\n\nFacebooks algorithm was the pride and joy of the company, and it has been copied the industry over. I think these algorithms and peoples desire to only hear the ideas they wish, while cancelling out decent, as the reasons for this \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect. (I got the \u201cecho chamber\u201d nomenclature from Tim Poole) So in a world where we only hear what we want, we become less exposed to views we may not share, regardless of the validity of the ideas expressed. No one is changing their minds. Everyone is dug in, seemingly ready for was, or at least the next election. It is going to get ugly. As both left and right further polarize, we remain a nation divided, in which one side can\u2019t even accept an idea from the other, and meanwhile, rational people in the middle are further jaded and disenfranchised, all stuck in their own \u201cecho chambers\u201d of happiness with no regard for any opposing views. I\u2019m not sure where we go from here, but as a proud American and defender of the first Amendment, I don\u2019t trust these technocrats and their flawed math formulas to control communications in this country. It seems that ethics are gone in journalism and in all other facets of American life. Everything negative that happens to them is the fault of the other side.

[this helped start revolutions, but it couldn\u2019t maintain them](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/social-media-made-the-arab-spring-but-couldnt-save-it/), as more fundamentalist and outrageous posts, sometimes sheer trolling, helped further the grip of discourse in the countries. misinformation and trolling ran rampant, and what was once a free for all became a -----> tool !!!  to strengthen dictatorship. elections and opinion could be guided or misguided by this algorithmic flaw.\n\nfacebooks algorithm was the pride and joy of the company, and it has been copied the industry over. i think these algorithms and peoples desire to only hear the ideas they wish, while cancelling out decent, as the reasons for this \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect. (i got the \u201cecho chamber\u201d nomenclature from tim poole) so in a world where we only hear what we want, we become less exposed to views we may not share, regardless of the validity of the ideas expressed. no one is changing their minds. everyone is dug in, seemingly ready for was, or at least the next election. it is going to get ugly. as both left and right further polarize, we remain a nation divided, in which one side can\u2019t even accept an idea from the other, and meanwhile, rational people in the middle are further jaded and disenfranchised, all stuck in their own \u201cecho chambers\u201d of happiness with no regard for any opposing views. i\u2019m not sure where we go from here, but as a proud american and defender of the first amendment, i don\u2019t trust these technocrats and their flawed math formulas to control communications in this country. it seems that ethics are gone in journalism and in all other facets of american life. everything negative that happens to them is the fault of the other side. this is precisely the \u201cmob rule\u201d referred to in the federalist papers. if our nation remains divided, it is a house that will not stand. i believe abraham lincoln said that. let\u2019s get back to fighting for our country and having reasonable debate. i said that.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 1, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/az9149/the_internet_americas_echo_chamber_newspaper_cup/',)", "identifyer": 5790811, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Tool_Hip", "date": 1552147730000, "content": "Windows Server 2019 Standard and DataCenter 2019 Download Free - Tool Hip", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/az4ysk/windows_server_2019_standard_and_datacenter_2019/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "windows server 2019 standard and datacenter 2019 download free - -----> tool !!!  hip", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://toolhip.com/windows-server-2019-standard-and-datacenter-2019-download-free/',)", "identifyer": 5790859, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "mvea", "date": 1552135739000, "content": "Silicon Valley startups backed by celebrities like Bill Gates are using gene-editing tool Crispr to make meat without farms \u2014 and to disrupt a $200 billion industry", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/az36ab/silicon_valley_startups_backed_by_celebrities/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "silicon valley startups backed by celebrities like bill gates are using gene-editing -----> tool !!!  crispr to make meat without farms \u2014 and to disrupt a $200 billion industry", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 106, "comments": 34, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-startups-using-crispr-chicken-beef-memphis-meats-new-age-meats-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T',)", "identifyer": 5790890, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "MyNameIsGriffon", "date": 1569253320000, "content": "New ruling gives legal boost to a key data journalism tool", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/d888wm/new_ruling_gives_legal_boost_to_a_key_data/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "new ruling gives legal boost to a key data journalism -----> tool !!!

As a front end developer, I turn design files into front-end code regularly. But it's a repetitive and demotivating task. It takes time, lots of meetings and boring back and forth questions. I want to change that.\n\nSo I tried to automate this process. I trained a deep learning (DL) model to visually understand what elements are in a webpage (e.g. input, button, nav, etc) and build the front-end boiler plate automatically for me. I learned a lot in the process, the actual site builder is a mathematical interpretation of a Sketch file and the DL model outputs what elements to include in what section.\n\nTo be completely transparent I'm not quite there yet.
