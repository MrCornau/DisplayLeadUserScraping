More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose.\n\nWhile this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological \u201crevolutions.\u201d Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general.\n\nThis was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts \u2014 particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-migrant-workers-miserable/589423/) or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems.\n\nSome (most notably [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab)) now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on.\n\nWhile all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the \u201cjob\u201d by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority.\n\n**The Rise of the Precariat**\n\nAll technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.\n\nThis phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moore\u2019s Law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweil\u2019s Law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.\n\nThis has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years \u2014 in regions like the Rust Belt, for example \u2014 and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words \u201cprecarious\u201d and \u201cproletariat\u201d) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.\n\nIf the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.\n\nWhile technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual.

(those in the former group are often called [luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/historyuk/historyofbritain/the-luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century england who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) the fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. this leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. as adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.\n\nthis phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. if anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [moore\u2019s law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [kurzweil\u2019s law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). for futurists and tech ceos, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. for [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.\n\nthis has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years \u2014 in regions like the rust belt, for example \u2014 and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words \u201cprecarious\u201d and \u201cproletariat\u201d) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.\n\nif the fourth industrial revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via ai and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.\n\nwhile technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), may share a similar fate due to advances in ai. if a therapy \u201cbot\u201d can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people?\n\nthis begs the very blunt question: if these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do?\n\n**the impact on mental health**\n\nwhile this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this
