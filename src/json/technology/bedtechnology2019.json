As people are demanding easier ways to avail medical treatment and diagnosis, there have been several advances in telemedicine. Telemedicine is a method that involves providing clinical services through a distance. Through telemedicine, the user doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be present at the hospital or clinic and can avail medical consultation through the comfort of his home.\n\nEarlier, telemedicine was used for treating people in remote places as well as people who could not afford or access modes of hospital visits. But as time progressed and telemedicine systems advanced, analysts were able to unfold the true potential held by these systems.\n\n**Cloud Access and Smartphones Have Laid a Collaborative Foundation for Telemedicine**\n\nAs the number of smartphone users has risen significantly in the past decade, almost all computer-operating software are being integrated into mobile OS as well. The advancements in smartphones have been exceptional, so much so that people would now prefer to have a smartphone that would do the work of a computer, rather than using the actual computer. Technology has played a key role in the recent surge in the adoption of smartphones. Cloud integration is among the long lists of benefits offered by smartphones.\n\nCloud integration, combined with the availability of fast data networks among many regions in the world, has opened up a broader scope of advancements for telemedicine. Could-integrated systems enable the elimination of a locally installed physical drive. These factors significantly reduce the cost and space associated with the functioning of telemedicine.\n\n**\u2018Remote Patient Monitoring\u2019 Among the Key Benefits Offered by Telemedicine Services**\n\nTelemedicine allows medical examination and consultation of patients residing almost anywhere in the world. With minimal operational pre-requisites, telemedicine services offer massive benefits such as improved efficiency, faster diagnosis, precise medication, and consultation. Remote patient monitoring is one of the primary benefits of telemedicine. Through video-enabled platforms, doctors or related personnel can interact with the patient residing almost anywhere in the world.\n\nConcepts such as constant monitoring and updates allow more frequent consultation. Patients do not necessarily have to travel longer distances again and again. These benefits save a huge amount of time and money, which would have been much higher in cases of hospital visits. Patients who are bed-ridden and physically disabled can benefit hugely from remote patient monitoring. As a result, telemedicine services are gaining more popularity in the coming years.\n\nBesides remote patient monitoring, telemedicine possesses several other benefits. The main reason behind the rise of the telemedicine industry is the flexibility and comfort that it offers. The advances in telemedicine largely favor geriatric population. Additionally, people who cannot afford services such as hospital visits, high costs of in-hospital stays, and on-the-stop doctor consultation will also contribute to the growing popularity of telemedicine.\n\n**A few of the other benefits offered by telemedicine include:**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reimbursement policies\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flexibility in scheduling doctor consultation\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Improved access to care\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reduced administrative tasks\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patient tracking and monitoring\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cases of natural disasters\n\n**Telemedicine Holds Massive Potential in Disaster Management**\n\nThe use of telemedicine is not just limited to bed-ridden patients. Events such as natural disasters hold a huge potential for telemedicine and telemedicine consultation services. In cases of floods, earthquakes, and other disasters, it is difficult for people to travel to the hospital or even consult doctors in clinics, for that matter. Moreover, natural disasters such as tsunamis leave people exposed to viral diseases.\n\nThe chances of epidemics are higher during these events. In such cases, telemedicine can help people avail medical services at the comfort of their homes and avoid outdoor hospital visits. This helps in reducing the risks associated with infections and epidemic diseases. With technology at the fore of several telemedicine services, there is a significant rise in the efficacies associated with these services.\n\n**As Telemedicine Are Gaining Popularity, Diverse Healthcare Markets to Open Up**\n\nAs telemedicine is growing in popularity, investors are likely to hover around.

It's in the section titled \"App Happy.\" The author writes:\n\n    \u201cKeyMe\u201d lets users scan their house or car keys and order a duplicate to be sent in the mail. They also have kiosks in places like 7-Eleven and Bed Bath and Beyond, where the key is duplicated on the spot.\n\nThe App website has an interesting FAQ section that addresses \"do not duplicate\" keys:\n\n    Can I copy \"Do Not Duplicate\" keys?\n\n    Yes, KeyMe can copy any key marked 'Do Not Duplicate.' The reason is that the 'Do Not Duplicate' marking carries with it no greater security than any other brass key. The Associated Locksmiths of America (ALOA) has gone so far as to call the use of such markings \"deceptive\" because they provide \"a false sense of security.\" It further advises its members to handle these keys in the same manner as any other key. The only exception to this is within the Los Angeles city limits. Due to a city ordinance, these keys may not be copied.

Our kiosks require a fingerprint scan and/or a credit card swipe to access scanned keys. Like an ATM, all transactions are recorded to provide an added layer of security. Our mobile app requires keys be scanned on both sides on a white paper background from 4 inches away to prevent \"flyby\" scans of your keys. We provide real-time notifications any time new activity occurs on your account so you can monitor &amp; manage the security of your keys. When ordering keys, we store only the necessary personal information on file and keep no information that could be used to link your key with a location or lock.
