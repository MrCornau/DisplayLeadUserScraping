Then on a different night, my TV was off and randomly turned on by itself so I decided to look up on Google why it would do that. I found that when remote batteries are low, they send delayed signals so if I tried to turn on and it didn't work it might still send that signal later on. So I changed the batteries in my TV remote, went to go turn my TV on, and as soon as I pressed the power button, not only did my TV turn on, my LED lights turned from blue to red. So basically, different buttons on my TV remote make my LED lights change certain colors. My up &amp; exit buttons turn them blue, as I said the power button makes them red, right and mute buttons make them purple, and select makes them white.

Employees of Facebook Inc., FB -0.23% Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG +0.30% Google, Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.08% and Amazon. AMZN +0.46% com Inc. were involved, along with the White House and famed venture investors.\n\nMonths later, the Technology and Research Task Force\u2019s biggest plans, such as a hospital-bed tracker, contact-tracing tools and a project to ship Kindle devices to nursing-home residents, have failed to materialize amid what members say were disagreements over privacy and other issues. It has cycled through members and a leadership change, and some of the group\u2019s biggest names, from Microsoft and Facebook to the White House, have dropped out or are playing minimal roles.\n\nMembers say that the experience has shown them that the tech industry can play an important supporting role as the world battles the coronavirus crisis, but technology alone won\u2019t save the day.\n\n\u201cAn app is not going to fix this,\u201d said John Borthwick, a New York-based venture capital investor who is now leading the group.\n\nJohn Borthwick, a venture capitalist who now heads the renamed Covid-19 Technology Task Force, said the group was \u2018messy at the beginning.\u2019\n\nThe task force had been working with developers building contact-tracing apps, one of its goals. When Apple Inc. AAPL -0.01% and Google later announced their own effort to help track infected people on behalf of governments, some members say they were taken aback. Some questioned its effectiveness and the companies\u2019 ability to keep user information completely private, members said.\n\nMr. Borthwick took over the renamed Covid-19 Technology Task Force in late April. He said the group, formed amid the chaos of early March, was \u201cmessy at the beginning.\u201d He is now refocusing its efforts on making connections and sharing information, rather than developing its own projects.\n\nThe group is organizing a virtual \u201chackathon,\u201d to drive interest in tackling the issue of social isolation, and is hosting a series of online events on contact tracing with public health officials and other experts.\n\nAs they brought together representatives from tech giants and government in March, task force members harnessed the \u201csave the world\u201d ethos that for years has defined Silicon Valley.\n\nEveryone wanted to help. The biggest problem was managing the deluge of ideas pouring in from the tech community, members say.\n\nThe impetus for the task force came from Josh Mendelsohn, a former Google employee who founded the company\u2019s disaster response program after Hurricane Katrina, working on a system that coordinated helicopter rescues across the Gulf states.\n\nNow a managing partner at the New York-based venture firm Hangar, Mr. Mendelsohn enlisted Ron Conway, an angel investor renowned in Silicon Valley for his early bets on Twitter Inc., Google and Facebook and his wide industry network.\n\nRon Conway, an angel investor renowned in Silicon Valley, was an early member of the task force.\n\nSome 45 people joined an early task force call in mid-March, including Michael Kratsios, the White House\u2019s chief technology officer, and his deputy, Lynne Parker, along with representatives from the big tech companies.\n\nThe group soon ran into controversy: privacy. After seeing tech giants get hammered by regulators and lawmakers over data-collection practices pre-pandemic, conversations about tracking individuals\u2019 virus exposure via cellphones and other initiatives got lost in policy and regulatory concerns.\n\nCaroline Buckee, a Harvard University epidemiologist and early member of the task force, said weekly Zoom meetings devolved into long discussions about privacy implications and best practices for data.\n\n\u201cIt was fragmented and it was unclear what the goals were,\u201d Ms. Buckee said.\n\nShe and another early member, the geolocation startup Camber Systems, left the group to build a network of aggregated location data to help cities and states track how residents are moving around, called Covid-19 Mobility Data Network.\n\nPublic health authorities, developers and tech companies are working on apps to help us keep track of who we came in contact with and where we\u2019ve been to aid in Covid-19 contact-tracing efforts. WSJ\u2019s Joanna Stern explains the technologies using an 8-bit video game.\n\nThe April 10 announcement of the Apple-Google project further complicated efforts as members grew unsure about what to focus on next. Ms. Buckee of Harvard was among members who questioned whether the two companies\u2019 opt-in system\u2014which uses Bluetooth technology to track users\u2019 cellphones and alert those who were exposed to virus carriers\u2014would be effective as designed.\n\nMembers and executives at other companies contacted Apple and Google, skeptical that the effort would truly protect the privacy of users, or unsure that cities and states would opt for tech tools over human contact tracers.\n\nJulie Brill, privacy head at Microsoft, and Peter Lee, head of research and incubation, and not members of the task force, warned in a post on the company website that despite \u201crising excitement\u201d about using technology to fight the pandemic, companies needed to consider evolving regulations as well as individuals\u2019 comfort with sharing data.\n\n\u201cTechnical advances, such as the use of mobile phones to collect data of various kinds, need to be considered in the larger context of the complexity of the world,\u201d the executives wrote.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said, \u201cnothing we\u2019ve seen in the Apple and Google solution appears to violate the privacy principles in our blog post.\u201d\n\nMr. Conway said he was \u201cstrongly in favor\u201d of the Google and Apple project and said he wasn\u2019t aware of anyone on the task force who wasn\u2019t supportive of the companies\u2019 efforts.\n\nA spokesman for Apple, speaking on behalf of both Apple and Google, said the technology isn\u2019t a substitute for traditional, in-person contact tracing and \u201cboth companies are firmly grounded in the fact that it\u2019s another tool at the disposal of public health agencies\u2014not a silver bullet.\u201d\n\nThe companies earlier this month released the technology supporting contact-tracing from mobile devices. Three states have requested access to the technology but no apps are available yet in the U.S. using the Apple-Google standard.\n\nStarting in late March, some task force members said they could no longer reach White House aides. Cities and states\u2014not Washington\u2014were making decisions over which technologies to use, making joint tech efforts even harder to manage.\n\nA spokeswoman for the White House said it hadn\u2019t been involved with the group since the call in mid-March, noting that the administration is engaged with the tech industry, such as a partnership with International Business Machines Corp. and Amazon to offer free supercomputing resources to help develop virus treatments.\n\nThe group\u2019s leader, Mr. Mendelsohn, was juggling volumes of email about the task force along with his day job\u2014funding startups through Hangar\u2014and family duties.\n\n\u201cI finally had to cry uncle,\u201d Mr. Mendelsohn said of his decision to step aside from running the group. \u201cThis is a job for people with grown kids.\u201d\n\nThe task force now counts about 18 members in its working group in addition to Mr. Borthwick; 140 companies receive regular updates on its doings, Mr. Borthwick said. Everyone is a volunteer.\n\nIt has appointed a new advisory board, which includes Robert Iger, the former Walt Disney Company chief executive, and Leon Panetta, the former U.S. secretary of Defense. The board is involved \u201cwhen they wish or when there\u2019s something specific we need to ask them,\u201d said Mr. Borthwick.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Panetta said he was unavailable. A representative for Mr. Iger didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to bring a degree of modesty,\u201d Mr. Borthwick said. \u201cLess thinking of tech as a
