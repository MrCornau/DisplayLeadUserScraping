A data mining system execute one or more tasks as part of data mining.\n\n1. **Classification**\n\n* Classification technique is used for assigning the items into target categories or classes which is used to predict what will occur within the class accurately.\n* It classifies each item in a set of data into one of a predefined set of classes or groups.\n\n1. **Outlier Detection**\n\nOutliers is defined as the data objects that do not comply with the general behaviour or model of the data available.\n\n1. **Clustering**\n\nCluster analysis is one of the techniques of data mining by which related records are grouped. As a result, objects are like one another within the same group. Although, they are different in same or other clusters.\n\n1. **Regression**\n\nThis technique is used for establishing the dependency between the two variables so that causal relationship can be used to predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Prediction**\n\nPrediction is made by finding the relationship between independent and dependent variables.\n\n1. **Decision Trees**\n\n* Decision tree is one of the analytical technique of Data Mining.\n* This technique is used for categorising or predict data.\n\n**Important Data Mining Tools**\n\nThere are different Data Mining Tools for performing data mining tasks are as follows,\n\n1. **Oracle Data Mining**\n\n* It is Proprietary License Software.\n* It provides us data mining algorithms for data classification, prediction, regression and specialized analytics that enables analysts to analyse insights, make better predictions, target best customers, identify cross-selling opportunities &amp; detect fraud.\n* The algorithms designed inside ODM leverage has the strengths of Oracle database.\n* The data mining feature of SQL can dig data out of database tables, views, and schemas.\n* The GUI of Oracle data miner is an extended version of Oracle SQL Developer.\n* It provides a facility of direct \u2018drag &amp; drop\u2019 of data inside the database to users thus giving better insight.\n\n1. **IBM SPSS Modeler**\n\n* It is Proprietary License Software.\n* It was originally produced by SPSS Inc. and later acquired by IBM.\n* It is a software suite owned by\u00a0[IBM\u00a0](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/)that is used for data mining &amp; text data analytics.\n* It has a rich visual interface that allows users to work with data mining algorithms without the need of programming.\n* It eliminates the unnecessary complexities faced during data transformations and to make easy to use predictive models.\n* IBM SPSS comes in two editions, based on the features\n* IBM SPSS Modeler Professional\n* IBM SPSS Modeler Premium- contains additional features of text analytics, entity analytics etc.\n\n1. **Weka**\n\n* It is open source and free software.\n* It is best suited for data analysis and predictive modelling.\n* It contains algorithms and visualization tools that support data mining tasks and machine learning.\n* Weka has a GUI that gives easy access to all its features.\n* It is written in JAVA language.\n* Weka supports major data mining tasks including data mining, processing, visualization, regression etc.\n* Weka can also provide access to SQL Databases through database connectivity and can further process the data returned by the query.\n\n1. **IBM Cognos**\u00a0\n\n* It is Proprietary License Software.\n* BM Cognos BI is an intelligence suite owned by IBM for reporting and data analysis, score carding etc.\n* It consists of sub-components that meet specific organizational requirements Cognos Connection, Query Studio, Report Studio, Analysis Studio, Event studio &amp; Workspace Advance.\n   * **Cognos Connection:**It is a\u00a0web portal to gather and summarize data in scoreboard/reports.\n   * **Query Studio:**It contains queries to format data &amp; create diagrams.\n   * **Report Studio:**It is used to generate management reports.\n   * **Analysis Studio:**It is used to process large data volumes, understand &amp; identify trends.\n   * **Event Studio:**Notification module to keep in sync with events.\n   * **Workspace Advanced:**User-friendly interface to create personalized &amp; user-friendly documents.\n\n1. **Rapid Miner Software**\n\n* It is anOpen source software.\n* It is one of the best predictive analysis systems developed by the company with the same name as the Rapid Miner.\n* Written in JAVA programming language.\n* It provides an integrated environment for deep learning, text mining, machine learning &amp; predictive analysis.\n* It can be used for over various applications such as business applications, commercial applications, training, education, research, application development, machine learning.\n* Rapid Miner offers the server as both on premise &amp; in public/private cloud infrastructures.\n* It has a client/server model as its base.\n* Rapid Miner comes with template-based frameworks that enable speedy delivery with reduced number of errors.\n* Rapid Miner has three modules,\n\n1.

There is a lot of writing out there about hard skills that are useful for interviews, but I don't see that much about strategies to help people succeed. I think most of the candidates that we interview have the hard skills to pass our phone screen, but they are nervous and don't apply those hard skills effectively during the interview. For context, this is a \\~100 person startup, and about 50% of people make it to the second round of our interviews.\n\n**(1) Assuming the question has a fancy silver bullet.**\n\nWhen you\u2019re interviewing for a generalist position at a software company, it\u2019s pretty unlikely that their phone screen is going to require you to know what a Bloom filter is (although they are quite cool) and how to use it. And yet candidates consistently scrap OK solutions that aren\u2019t quite optimized and start diving into crazy tangents. Just like in an actual programming job, save the complex and specialized data structures for situations where their usage is clear. There\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re all still using arrays (and merge sort) 70+ years later.\n\nHow to fix: use standard algorithms and data structures as building blocks.\n\n**(2) Ignoring interviewer hints and suggestions.**\n\nThis one can manifest itself in a couple of ways. The most egregious is when the interviewer makes a fairly clear hint such as \u201cwhat if we used a stack instead of a tree?\u201d, and the suggestion is either ignored or dismissed out of hand. As an interviewer, I\u2019m trying to help you! There is no situation in which people will intentionally mislead you. When the interviewer makes an explicit suggestion, they are either trying to guide you along the right path or trying to have you prove that your current solution is optimal (in which case you\u2019ll probably already know that your current solution is a good one). Regardless of which they are doing, just ignoring the hint won\u2019t do you any good.\n\nOccasionally candidates will take the hint, spend a little bit of time trying to work it into their solution, and then cast it aside and return to whatever wasn\u2019t working before (or onto a new thing). If someone gives you a suggestion and you don\u2019t think it works that\u2019s fine, but you should have a clear explanation for why an alternative solution is better than the one suggested to you. Remember, we\u2019re trying to help you get the right solution and we have the answer key, so it\u2019s likely that our suggestions are going to be helpful (not to say that people don\u2019t occasionally come up with great solutions that aren\u2019t in the answer key).\n\nHow to fix: give any input from your interviewer strong consideration.\n\n**(3) Forcing a square peg into a round hole.**\n\nThis ties into the one above, but candidates will frequently pick a solution early on and tack on enhancements for every problem that it has. If your answer doesn\u2019t feel like a clean fit for the problem, then there is most likely a flaw with the foundation of your solution, not the wallpaper. Don\u2019t be afraid to scrap your current solution (especially if you can articulate why it\u2019s bad) and pick a new one. The right answer is usually also a fast one, so don\u2019t worry about time constraints on that front.\n\nHow to fix: don\u2019t be afraid to scrap a solution and try out something new.\n\n**(4) Diving too far into details right away.**\n\nThis one doesn\u2019t sink candidates immediately, but it hurts them in two ways. First, once they\u2019ve described a solution in great detail they get invested and don\u2019t want to change it, leading to the problem (3). The bigger issue, though, is that it takes more time for the interviewer to figure out that it is a wrong solution. Interviewers will typically direct you away from wrong solutions and towards correct ones, so the faster they understand your solution the faster they can put you on the right track. Since interviews are time-limited, it\u2019s better to give a wrong solution in 30 seconds than in 5 minutes. And if the solution you gave is correct, or close to it, the interviewer can always prompt you for more detail.\n\nHow to fix: get it wrong or right quickly, then iterate from there.\n\n**(5) Filling the silence at all times.**\n\nI blame bad advice from college \u201chow to pass a technical interview\u201d seminars and online advice columns for this one. It is important to let your interviewer know what you\u2019re thinking, but just rambling is bad. The same way none of us sit down at a computer and start coding instantly when presented with a problem, it\u2019s OK to not start talking right away when presented with an interview question. Just saying something like \u201cjust let me think for a second\u201d is perfectly fine and can give you 30 seconds or a minute to concentrate. For the reasons discussed in (4), don\u2019t take too long, but 1 minute of silence followed by a correct answer is a lot better than 2 minutes of talking but no good answer. A brief silence also allows candidates to gather their thoughts and then present a coherent answer, which is definitely preferable to a jumbled answer.\n\nHow to fix: still communicate your thoughts, but don\u2019t be afraid to organize them first.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/c0wkm0/the_5_mistakes_i_see_candidates_make_the_most/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "technology", "result": true, "Selector": "tree", "selectorShort": "tree", "MarkedSent": "the 5 mistakes i see candidates make the most often. /!/  \n\ni've given 50+ phone screens in the past year and i see people making the same mistakes over and over again. there is a lot of writing out there about hard skills that are useful for interviews, but i don't see that much about strategies to help people succeed. i think most of the candidates that we interview have the hard skills to pass our phone screen, but they are nervous and don't apply those hard skills effectively during the interview. for context, this is a \\~100 person startup, and about 50% of people make it to the second round of our interviews.\n\n**(1) assuming the question has a fancy silver bullet.**\n\nwhen you\u2019re interviewing for a generalist position at a software company, it\u2019s pretty unlikely that their phone screen is going to require you to know what a bloom filter is (although they are quite cool) and how to use it. and yet candidates consistently scrap ok solutions that aren\u2019t quite optimized and start diving into crazy tangents. just like in an actual programming job, save the complex and specialized data structures for situations where their usage is clear. there\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re all still using arrays (and merge sort) 70+ years later.\n\nhow to fix: use standard algorithms and data structures as building blocks.\n\n**(2) ignoring interviewer hints and suggestions.**\n\nthis one can manifest itself in a couple of ways. the most egregious is when the interviewer makes a fairly clear hint such as \u201cwhat if we used a stack instead of a -----> tree !!! ?\u201d, and the suggestion is either ignored or dismissed out of hand. as an interviewer, i\u2019m trying to help you! there is no situation in which people will intentionally mislead you. when the interviewer makes an explicit suggestion, they are either trying to guide you along the right path or trying to have you prove that your current solution is optimal (in which case you\u2019ll probably already know that your current solution is a good one). regardless of which they are doing, just ignoring the hint won\u2019t do you any good.\n\noccasionally candidates will take the hint, spend a little bit of time trying to work it into their solution, and then cast it aside and return to whatever wasn\u2019t working before (or onto a new thing). if someone gives you a suggestion and you don\u2019t think it works that\u2019s fine, but you should have a clear explanation for why an alternative solution is better than the one suggested to you. remember, we\u2019re trying to help you get the right solution and we have the answer key, so it\u2019s likely that our suggestions are going to be helpful (not to say that people don\u2019t occasionally come up with great solutions that aren\u2019t in the answer key).\n\nhow to fix: give any input from your interviewer strong consideration.\n\n**(3) forcing a square peg into a round hole.**\n\nthis ties into the one above, but candidates will frequently pick a solution early on and tack on enhancements for every problem that it has. if your answer doesn\u2019t feel like a clean fit for the problem, then there is most likely a flaw with the foundation of your solution, not the wallpaper. don\u2019t be afraid to scrap your current solution (especially if you can articulate why it\u2019s bad) and pick a new one. the right answer is usually also a fast one, so don\u2019t worry about time constraints on that front.\n\nhow to fix: don\u2019t be afraid to scrap a solution and try out something new.\n\n**(4) diving too far into details right away.**\n\nthis one doesn\u2019t sink candidates immediately, but it hurts them in two ways. first, once they\u2019ve described a solution in great detail they get invested and don\u2019t want to change it, leading to the problem (3). the bigger issue, though, is that it takes more time for the interviewer to figure out that it is a wrong solution. interviewers will typically direct you away from wrong solutions and towards correct ones, so the faster they understand your solution the faster they can put you on the right track. since interviews are time-limited, it\u2019s better to give a wrong solution in 30 seconds than in 5 minutes. and if the solution you gave is correct, or close to it, the interviewer can always prompt you for more detail.\n\nhow to fix: get it wrong or right quickly, then iterate from there.\n\n**(5) filling the silence at all times.**\n\ni blame bad advice from college \u201chow to pass a technical interview\u201d seminars and online advice columns for this one. it is important to let your interviewer know what you\u2019re thinking, but just rambling is bad. the same way none of us sit down at a computer and start coding instantly when presented with a problem, it\u2019s ok to not start talking right away when presented with an interview question. just saying something like \u201cjust let me think for a second\u201d is perfectly fine and can give you 30 seconds or a minute to concentrate. for the reasons discussed in (4), don\u2019t take too long, but 1 minute of silence followed by a correct answer is a lot better than 2 minutes of talking but no good answer. a brief silence also allows candidates to gather their thoughts and then present a coherent answer, which is definitely preferable to a jumbled answer.\n\nhow to fix: still communicate your thoughts, but don\u2019t be afraid to organize them first.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 3, "comments": 5, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/c0wkm0/the_5_mistakes_i_see_candidates_make_the_most/',)", "identifyer": 5780287, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "auscomp", "date": 1553200495000, "content": "Gift a family tree to your kids.
