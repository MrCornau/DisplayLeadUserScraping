APS-C or Full-Frame? /!/ I have had an A5100 with the two kit lenses (Sony E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Lens and Sony E 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3 OSS Lens) for the past couple years.  I mainly take vacation photos (landscape/buildings and historical sights/interior of cathedrals).  I really like the compactness and lightness of the kit, which is perfect for walking, but I am finding it has limitations that are annoying me.  I'm having a hard time getting good photos in evening/night as everything comes out blurry and poorly defined when shooting hand-held.  My wife's iPhone X pictures come out crystal clear.  I also don't like the lack of viewfinder in combination with a fairly low-res back screen so it is hard to see if I have things set right.  The controls are also hidden behind menus that I'd love custom buttons for, as I feel like I spend too much time clicking through menus and not enough looking at what I traveled to see.\n\nRealistically my budget is about $1500 total, but I can stretch it and I definitely feel the siren call of the A7 III which seems to do everything about as perfectly as you can get.  So I'd like help from the community evaluating my options\n\nOption 1:  Go Full Frame and upgrade to A7II\nRealistically, $1200-2000 depending on which lenses I get.  I'd probably get the a Sony FE 50mm f/1.8 Prime and use either the kit lens or a Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 or wait for the Tamron 17-28mm f/2.8 for wide-angle.  A7 II has never been cheaper and would be a big upgrade in terms of low-light performance, and the 50mm would help with that too.  The problems I can see is that it's not very compact or light compared to the A5100, meaning it will be hard on my neck/shoulder walking with it all day for a week on vacation, and it wouldn't be easily concealed when walking from place to place.  I like being able to carry the A5100 in an interior coat pocket and being able to quickly pull it out for a shot before hiding it away again.  \n\nOption 1a: Just bite the bullet and get an A7 III (same lenses).\nIt looks like the A7 III does everything the A7 II does, and better.  It should be my camera for quite a few years, but looking at a $3000+ price tag with the new lenses really makes me squeamish.  \n\nOption 2: Upgrade APS-C lens only\nI'd just get a Sony SEL35F18 35mm f/1.8 Prime ($400), and maybe a Sony E 10-18mm F4 OSS ($750), and drop the 16-50mm lens.  That would help with low-light photography, but I don't know if the A5100 is maxing out using the kit lens.  Advantage, cheapest and smallest option, but wouldn't help with my annoyances with the camera UX.  \n\nOption 3: Upgrade to A6500 and add a SEL35F18 lens.\nCost is about $1500, A6500 has better auto-focus, slightly better dynamic range/iso, has a viewfinder, bluetooth, and extra custom buttons/UX improvements.
