{"interestingcomments": [{"Unnamed: 0": 136001, "autor": "inorman", "date": 1623747462000, "content": "ClearImage Zoom and APS-C modes are AMAZING for video. /!/ Seriously, ClearImage Zoom and APS-C modes are severely underrated tools on your Sony camera. They're AMAZING for video work and have clear [resolution benefits](https://imgur.com/a/w8QI7an). If you do video work with your Sony camera, do yourself a favor add them to your tool chest right now by mapping them to a custom key or into your Fn menu. \n\nWHAT IT IS: \n\nYou probably already know this, but anyways: ClearImage Zoom and APS-C modes effectively apply a crop to your recording so that you can, well, \"zoom-in\", for when you need more reach from your lens. These modes are particularly useful for video work. \n\nThe best part about these functions is that on any of the 24MP+ bodies like the a7III a7RIV, etc., you can still maintain true 4K video resolution, even with the 1.5x cropping of ClearImage Zoom or APS-C mode, making for a tangible benefit to video recording if you need more reach from your lens.\n\nIn my experience, this is extremely effective and any kind of quality difference between full-frame and APS-C modes or 1.5x ClearImage Zoom for video are negligible. In fact, the extra \"reach\" of the crop gives you more resolution on distant subjects and can really make a positive difference in detail in your video shots when you need just a little tighter field of view. \n\nI personally shoot a lot with prime lenses (usually for the aperture/size benefit) but sometimes that can feel restricting in terms of focal length coverage... but ClearImage Zoom and/or APS-C modes dramatically increased the usability range of my fixed focal length prime lenses. \n\nPRIMES BECOME ZOOMS\n\nIn my case, ClearImage Zoom has totally changed the way that I look at the usefulness of my primes. My a7III and a7C can do ClearImage Zoom up to 1.5x in 4K/24p/30p. With that, now my 18mm can be effectively an 18-27mm for 4K/24p recording. And with all 3 of my primes: 18mm, 35mm and 55mm, I basically have nearly full FOV coverage from an equivalent 18-72.5mm coverage in 4K shooting. \n\nZOOMS BECOME ZOOMIER\n\nThis is also beneficial to zoom lenses of course. It means a 24-70mm can become effectively a 24-105. Or as another example, a 17-28mm becomes up to a 17-56mm. That's a really useful improvement in overall reach with a single zoom lens. \n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE... IT GOES EVEN FARTHER: \n\nIt gets even more interesting and useful because in 4K recording, you can **COMBINE 1.5x APS-C mode with 1.5x ClearImage Zoom to get an effective 2.25x crop**, all while still capturing what's basically a 2.7K section of the sensor (on the a7III at least) that gets upsampled to 4K. The resulting video when doing this still looks exceptionally good in a 4K timeline and there's still a tangible resolution benefit to doing this: you'll be able to resolve significantly more detail on distant subjects.\n\nJust as an example, here's [what's possible on just my 55mm lens in term of zoom fields of view](https://imgur.com/a/fckAzrY) by using these modes. And these crops show that there is a [clear benefit in terms of resolution on distant subjects](https://imgur.com/a/w8QI7an) when combining both APS-C and ClearImage Zoom.\n\nSo even better now, by combining both modes, my single 18mm prime lens is now effectively an 18-40mm zoom.  And with my 3 small prime lenses (18, 35, 55), I can cover nearly any focal length equivalent from 18mm to 124mm. \n\nWHY AREN'T YOU USING THESE MODES FOR VIDEO?\n\nFor 4K video shooters, I really feel like these features are heavily overlooked because the idea of cropping an image feels inherently destructive. Why not use the full sensor if we have it right? \n\nBut remember that the fact that our output in video is already limited to 3840 pixels wide means that we're already dramatically downsampling from the full sensor width. Why not use some of those extra pixels for some extra zoom reach when we need it?\n\nDo you you ClearImage Zoom or APS-C mode for your video work? Why or why not?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/o09t6i/clearimage_zoom_and_apsc_modes_are_amazing_for/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "mapping", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "clearimage zoom and aps-c modes are amazing for video. /!/ seriously, clearimage zoom and aps-c modes are severely underrated tools on your sony camera. they're amazing for video work and have clear [resolution benefits](https://imgur.com/a/w8qi7an). if you do video work with your sony camera, do yourself a favor add them to your tool chest right now by -----> mapping !!!  them to a custom key or into your fn menu. \n\nwhat it is: \n\nyou probably already know this, but anyways: clearimage zoom and aps-c modes effectively apply a crop to your recording so that you can, well, \"zoom-in\", for when you need more reach from your lens. these modes are particularly useful for video work. \n\nthe best part about these functions is that on any of the 24mp+ bodies like the a7iii a7riv, etc., you can still maintain true 4k video resolution, even with the 1.5x cropping of clearimage zoom or aps-c mode, making for a tangible benefit to video recording if you need more reach from your lens.\n\nin my experience, this is extremely effective and any kind of quality difference between full-frame and aps-c modes or 1.5x clearimage zoom for video are negligible. in fact, the extra \"reach\" of the crop gives you more resolution on distant subjects and can really make a positive difference in detail in your video shots when you need just a little tighter field of view. \n\ni personally shoot a lot with prime lenses (usually for the aperture/size benefit) but sometimes that can feel restricting in terms of focal length coverage... but clearimage zoom and/or aps-c modes dramatically increased the usability range of my fixed focal length prime lenses. \n\nprimes become zooms\n\nin my case, clearimage zoom has totally changed the way that i look at the usefulness of my primes. my a7iii and a7c can do clearimage zoom up to 1.5x in 4k/24p/30p. with that, now my 18mm can be effectively an 18-27mm for 4k/24p recording. and with all 3 of my primes: 18mm, 35mm and 55mm, i basically have nearly full fov coverage from an equivalent 18-72.5mm coverage in 4k shooting. \n\nzooms become zoomier\n\nthis is also beneficial to zoom lenses of course. it means a 24-70mm can become effectively a 24-105. or as another example, a 17-28mm becomes up to a 17-56mm. that's a really useful improvement in overall reach with a single zoom lens. \n\nbut wait, there's more... it goes even farther: \n\nit gets even more interesting and useful because in 4k recording, you can **combine 1.5x aps-c mode with 1.5x clearimage zoom to get an effective 2.25x crop**, all while still capturing what's basically a 2.7k section of the sensor (on the a7iii at least) that gets upsampled to 4k. the resulting video when doing this still looks exceptionally good in a 4k timeline and there's still a tangible resolution benefit to doing this: you'll be able to resolve significantly more detail on distant subjects.\n\njust as an example, here's [what's possible on just my 55mm lens in term of zoom fields of view](https://imgur.com/a/fckazry) by using these modes. and these crops show that there is a [clear benefit in terms of resolution on distant subjects](https://imgur.com/a/w8qi7an) when combining both aps-c and clearimage zoom.\n\nso even better now, by combining both modes, my single 18mm prime lens is now effectively an 18-40mm zoom.  and with my 3 small prime lenses (18, 35, 55), i can cover nearly any focal length equivalent from 18mm to 124mm. \n\nwhy aren't you using these modes for video?\n\nfor 4k video shooters, i really feel like these features are heavily overlooked because the idea of cropping an image feels inherently destructive. why not use the full sensor if we have it right? \n\nbut remember that the fact that our output in video is already limited to 3840 pixels wide means that we're already dramatically downsampling from the full sensor width. why not use some of those extra pixels for some extra zoom reach when we need it?\n\ndo you you clearimage zoom or aps-c mode for your video work? why or why not?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 26779, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 139569, "autor": "cnr0", "date": 1609629557000, "content": "Are there any Sony QX users? /!/ I have purchased not one, but two QX100's in 2013.
