I obviously didn't want to spend 100 bucks on a professional grade window especially chosen and cut for this application, so I used the cheapest sort of right thickness glass I could imagine, a microscope sample slide. When reassembled I turned it on and - a blank screen greeted me. But I heard the lens whirring, and with a SD card it took nicely red tinted and sharp pictures. Turned out I had butchered the LCD connector. I mean if I killed the sensor or the CPU, but this was a way to close loose on the conversion.\n\nMy last ressort was getting one of these small Raspberry Pi HDMI monitors in case the HDMI port was still working - and it did!
