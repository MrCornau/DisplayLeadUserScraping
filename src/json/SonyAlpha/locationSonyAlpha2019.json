I have the original on my site but I figured I would post this here so people don't have to go to the link.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI\u2019ve written this article as there seems to be a gap in the information provided by Godox specific articles, videos and Sony flash articles with specific reference to the Godox system and how to use it with Sony cameras. Like any camera system, there are unique ways the lighting system works and this can be confusing for many people.\n\nI\u2019ve noted this is specific to the A7iii and A7Riii, however, this is due to these being the only two Sony cameras I have. As a result, I can\u2019t test it across the entire range of Sony cameras. It may or may not be applicable, feel free to try it out, it won\u2019t break anything.\n\nI will also try to update this article as time goes on, but if you feel anything is wrong here, please feel free to let me know, either via the comments or email. I might have missed something while writing it. If you know of any additional cameras from Sony that would be supported in the same way and you can validate they work, let me know and I\u2019ll update the article to reflect compatibility.\n\n&gt;***Note****: Godox do rebrand their gear under a number of names, so this should also be applicable to Flashpoint, Neewer, Adorama and Cheetah although I can\u2019t tell you the exact models*\n\nI\u2019ve tried to cover an overview of the most commonly used Godox gear first, along with some recommendations on what I believe are the best first purchases if you plan on buying into the Godox system with Sony. After the gear port of the article, I\u2019ve moved straight into the use with Sony, so feel free to skip the gear section if you feel this is irrelevant.\n\n## FLASH BASICS\n\nWhen I wrote this article, I realised that the audience in some cases may be new to flash. As a result, I\u2019ve included fairly basic descriptions of what I consider \u201cFlash Basics\u201d at certain points in the article. These will be relevant to a specific area I am writing about and will help extend the knowledge for a novice. These are not comprehensive detailed descriptions so you may need to research these further if you don\u2019t understand. They are areas that more experienced photographers will already know and as a result, to avoid boring the crap out of the more experienced photographers, I\u2019ve included these in a box entitled \u201cFlash Basics\u201d. An example of a subject I am talking about is \u201cWhat is Flash vs Ambient\u201d. In some cases, I\u2019ve written a short description, in others, I\u2019ve just pointed to a video that covers these areas well enough that it\u2019s pointless me writing about it.\n\nIf you are someone who has used flash extensively, feel free to ignore them, and I\u2019ve put them in blocks to make it easier to identify them. They have a bolded \u201cFlash Basics\u201d that looks like this:\n\n&gt;***Flash Basics: Sample***  \n*This is a sample example of flash basics description*\n\n# An overview of Godox Speedlights, Strobes and Triggers\n\nOne of the greatest advantages of the Godox system is the ability to mix and match speedlights and strobes with a variety of camera systems, along with the low-cost entry point for people looking to experiment or start using lighting for the first time. Many of the Strobe brands do not manufacture speedlights and many speedlight brands do not manufacture strobes. Godox (along with Profoto) is one of the few to provide both options. I\u2019ve tried to cover all speedlights, strobes, and triggers here, and I will continue to update these as time goes on, and new models arrive, but please understand I\u2019m not planning to buy every speedlight and strobe they manufacture so my hands-on experience with some models may be limited. \u00a0I have not covered the non-battery studio models of their strobe lineup.\n\n&gt;***Flash Basics \u2013 Speedlights vs strobes***  \n*The difference between these two has always been blurred, more so in recent years. Do a search on google and you\u2019ll find 5 different definitions. Some people consider the difference to be the power output; others whether it has a cable or battery, for some it\u2019s whether it has a fresnel or globe head.*  \n*I couldn\u2019t find any definitive definition which is part of the challenge. As a result, lets assume for the sake of this article that a speedlight is a lightweight flash that can be used on camera and the strobe is a high-powered flash designed to be used off camera. It\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t put a speedlight off camera, but you can\u2019t put a strobe on camera.*\n\n### Speedlight Options\n\nWith Godox\u2019s speedlight lineup, there are only 2 sizes for Godox, each with sub-options. You have a small low powered flash and a larger full powered flash. For each of these, there is a sub option with AA Batteries or a Godox rechargeable battery option, but they\u2019re essentially the same or similar model with different battery options/\n\nTypically in the speedlight range, a TT version is an AA battery version and a V version is one supplied with a rechargeable battery. \u00a0In the case of some (like the TT350/V350), the names match however with the V860 and TT685, they don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t ask me why. The S indicates Sony version, although they are compatible with other cameras if used with the brand specific trigger. i.e. you can trigger a Sony flash on a Fujifilm camera with a Fujifilm trigger.\n\n#### Godox TT350S/V350S\n\nThe Godox TT350S and V350S are similar the same unit, however, the V350S version comes with a battery and charger whilst the TT350S uses 2 AA batteries.\u00a0The V350S goes for $159 and the TT350S goes for $89.\n\nThe small flash is more suited to the size of the Sony mirrorless cameras, however, these units have a limited amount of power, about 2 stops worse than the larger brother, and this, in turn, will limit your capability with the speedlight. I\u2019m personally not a huge fan of on camera flash, so I would avoid this option unless you intend using it as an on camera flash for travel where you need to keep the weight down. Long term, I think most users will outgrow the capability of the speedlight fairly quickly, so unless you\u2019re a point and shoot photographer with no intentions of ever taking the flash off your camera, go for the V860 which I cover in the next section.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/aacqnammc0j21.jpg\n\nI would recommend the internal rechargeable over the AA version if you do go for this model. The recharge time between flashes is faster and the batteries can produce more full-powered flashes per charge. The version that comes with rechargeable batteries is more expensive for obvious reasons.\n\n#### Godox TT685S/V860iiS\n\nThe TT688S and X are the full powered speedlights Godox\u2019s range offering a power output of 85ws, hence the 85 in the name. Whilst the 685 is large, it also offers what I consider the minimum acceptable power for any decent flash work.\n\nAs with the TT350, the 685 is offered in two different versions, an AA version, and a rechargeable version. The V860iiS goes for $189 whilst the TT685S goes for $110. As you can see from the pricing, there is only a small premium for the V860 over the V350 with a substantial power increase, and as a result, unless size is a constraint, I\u2019d recommend buying the more powerful version.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0fwkntinc0j21.jpg\n\nImportant note: The TT685 and V860ii are prone to hotshoe breaks for some obscure reason. If this does occur, hotshoes can be purchased separately and at a fairly low cost. I haven\u2019t had to replace mine as I do not do much on-camera flash, but I\u2019d recommend carrying a spare speedlight if you shoot weddings. For more information on replacing the hotshoe, have a look at this article and video.\n\n&gt;**Important note:** The larger Godox speedlights are known to have hotshoe breakage issues for people who use them heavily.  \nIf this occurs, you can buy replacement hotshoes on [EBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Hot-Shoe-mounting-foot-for-Godox-V860IIS-V860-S-Flash-Speedlite-repair-parts-/182728975320) or at your local Godox stockist. There are many videos that show the replacement process on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS5XKzbSvuo).\n\n### Strobe options (200WS+ options)\n\nGodox has a good range of strobes, but for the purpose of this, I\u2019m going to focus on the battery-powered strobes which include the AD200, AD360, AD400 and AD600/AD600 Pro. The name indicates the power output of the strobe. I.e. the AD200 has 200ws of power whilst the AD600 has 600ws.\n\n#### Godox AD200\n\nThe AD200 is the most popular strobe from Godox due to the compact size and high-powered output. It\u2019s provided in a case with both a fresnel and bulb head, along with a bracket to mount it on a light stand. If you are looking to get into off-camera flash, this is where I would start. It\u2019s small, flexible and lightweight, and you can carry 3 with you without breaking a sweat. The AD200 retails for around US$300 without a trigger which is pretty reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z5z2ohipc0j21.jpg\n\nBattery power on the AD200 is very good. I\u2019ve used two of these in a forest with 4 fellow photographers and about 1,000 pops without draining the battery but ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the power output.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1s80w83rc0j21.jpg\n\nOne of the great things with the AD200 is that Godox offer a bowens bracket with built in modelling lamp that allows you to combine two AD200\u2019s into a single 400ws strobe. That gives you the flexibility of having a single AD400 and two AD200\u2019s depending on what you are planning to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kbanlhzrc0j21.jpg\n\n#### Godox AD400\n\nThe AD400 was released in 2018 and is new to the Godox lineup. It falls cleanly between the AD200 and AD600. The AD400 starts to bridge into a territory of being too large to carry around in your camera bag, due to the increased thickness which is twice as thick as the AD200.\n\nI don\u2019t have hands-on experience with this model, but many of photographers I know that have purchased these love them.\n\nIn comparison to the AD600 Pro, I would question whether you will need 600WS of power. The AD400 should be sufficient for most situations. My Magbox review consisted of two AD200\u2019s shooting into the sun and it was more than enough power to overpower the sun so it would have to be some pretty brutal light or a large softbox to need more than this.\n\n#### Godox AD600/AD600 Pro (available in TTL or Manual/HSS)\n\nThe AD600 and AD600 Pro models are the most powerful strobes in Godox\u2019s lineup that consist of a built-in battery as opposed to an external battery pack. The pro version is a recent upgrade to the AD6oo and offers more stable colour temperature and faster recycle times. The AD600 series comes with a weight premium over the smaller models.\n\nThe AD600 (non-Pro) comes in a manual version which includes HSS, or a TTL version which includes HSS. They used to offer it in a unique Godox or Bowens mount, but the Godox mount seems to have been phased out in favour of Bowens mount. If you have the option of both, I\u2019d recommend a TTL Bowens mount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ph1pksntc0j21.jpg\n\n#### Common Godox strobe accessories\n\nGodox offer some nice accessories for the AD series of strobes. These include extension cables to take the strobe bulb off the head of the strobe and extend it on a cable with the strobe unit becoming a battery pack. This is great for keeping weight off the head in stronger winds or when you have an assistant hand holding a softbox on a boom and they aren\u2019t Superman.\n\n### Triggers\n\nGodox has two triggers which I have covered below. If you want to skip this section and know which to buy,\u00a0buy the XPro S, it\u2019s worth the additional cost over the X1S. If buying the XPro is going to mean you can feed yourself, get the X1, it\u2019ll do most of what the XPro can do, but it\u2019s not nearly as intuitive or well designed.\n\nThe Godox speedlights can also be used as triggers but I\u2019d recommend using a dedicated trigger for usability reasons.\n\n#### Godox X1 S Trigger\n\nThe X1 is the original trigger from Godox. I had this when I was shooting Nikon, and when I shot with Fujifilm but switched to the XPro when it was released. It\u2019s a good trigger, but with the availability of the XPro trigger, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for the simple reason that you can get a far better trigger for a minimal amount more and it is worth the difference.\n\nThe X1 trigger offers full control over the Godox tangle of speedlights and strobes with the ability to switch between manual and TTL and it\u2019s capable of triggering HSS with compatible cameras.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f454v99vc0j21.jpg\n\nWhilst the X1 is capable of doing the job, it has some small annoyances which is why I recommend the XPro:\n\n1. For one, the trigger sits flat on the hot shoe which limits access to some of the controls on the camera. This is less of an issue with Sony but with Fujifilm, the top dials were more critical.\n2. The second big annoyance is the rear dials one the trigger bump your head when looking through the viewfinder and are accidentally adjusted\n3. Usability is far worse \u2013 the XPro is more intuitive\n\n#### Godox XPro\u00a0S Trigger\n\nThe XPro\u00a0S is what I consider V2 of the X1 trigger and a far better design. In conjunction to the functionality offered with the X1 trigger, the XPro offers:\n\n1. TTL to Manual \u2013 The ability to take the current TTL settings and switch over to complete manual allowing you more control if you are not happy with some of the refinements in TTL. This reduces the requirement for a light meter.  \nSmaller increments\n2. From a usability perspective, the XPro wins heads and shoulders over the X1, it\u2019s almost hard to compare the two, like a beta and a final version.\n3. You can zoom in so only the current group is shown on-screen if you aren\u2019t using multiple groups\n4. The design offers more of a slanted upright view, ensuring the trigger is kept away from the controls and your forehead\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/osytp12yc0j21.jpg\n\n### Receivers\n\nAll of the strobes and speedlights covered in this article have receivers built into the flash unit.\n\n### Do I buy TTL or Manual?\n\nThis will probably be controversial, but some of the seasoned professionals are going to tell you \u201cdon\u2019t worry about TTL, no professional uses TTL\u201d. I\u2019m going to respectfully disagree with these people, many of whom have never actually shot with a TTL strobe. For them, it\u2019s about the comfort of doing things they way they have always done and the discomfort with losing control, but like anything, technology changes and TTL has matured to a point where it is pro-ready. Think of it like mirrorless. The initial mirrorless cameras were basic consumer grade cameras, but now mirrorless is good enough for professional use and the same applies to TTL. Its matured and in many cases is capable of making decisions more accurately due to its ability to adapt to changing lighting conditions. Using TTL isn\u2019t about losing control, you have the same level of control in dynamic situations. I.e. sun goes behind the clouds and all of a sudden, your lighting needs to change, but with TTL, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIn short, if you know enough about strobes to know what you need, buy whatever you want, if you don\u2019t, buy the TTL version. Best case scenario, you buy TTL and don\u2019t use it, worst case, you buy manual and need TTL and don\u2019t have it.\n\n&gt;**Flash Basics: What is TTL?**  \nTTL (Through The Lens) is where the flash automatically decides how much exposure to use based on what it see\u2019s through the lens. The idea is you set up the depth of field and shutter, and TTL will try ensure you get a perfectly exposed image. Here is a simple explanation of TTL on [youtube](https://youtu.be/VnU-QHIyp5o)\n\n### What Godox gear would I recommend buying?\n\nIf you\u2019re an experience flash photographer you can probably skip this section because you should have a fair idea of what you need.\n\n* If you are on a limited budget and have no experience with the flash, you could start with the TT350 or V350, but overall, if your budget isn\u2019t limited I\u2019d recommend getting the V860ii instead because it is a little better from a future-proofing perspective.\n* If you want a recommended starting point for getting into off camera flash, I\u2019d recommended starting point would be an AD200 and an XPro Trigger. This will give you a starting point with a powerful enough flash to grow into decent softboxes. It is also powerful enough to overpower the sun in many situations and can be doubled up with another one in a Godox supplied bracket for a 400ws strobe.\n* If you have a good budget, I\u2019d say get a single AD600\u00a0Pro and two AD200\u2019s or AD400\u2019s, depending on how many lights you need. You could also get a V860ii which could double as a 4th light due to the interoperability of the lights.\n\n&gt;***Flash Basics: What about modifiers Should I buy?***\u00a0  \n*Flash modifiers is a massive topic in itself \u2013 you could write an entire article dedicated to it. For the sake of keeping it simple, if you\u2019re new to lighting, I\u2019d recommend starting with the* [*40 or 60cm square softbox if you have a speedlight*](http://www.godox.com/EN/Products_S_type_Speedlite_Bracket.html)*, or an 80-90cm Octa (round) softbox if you are buying a strobe. My preference for larger softboxes is the Magbox or Rimelite due to the ease at which they can be set up but they also come with a big price premium. If you can\u2019t afford these, a basic Godox model would be adequate.*\n\n# How to get going with flash on your Sony Gear\n\n## PRE-SETTINGS TO AVOID COMMON PROBLEMS\n\nWhen using the Godox system with your Sony camera, there are a couple of things you need to set up on your camera to avoid problems. I\u2019ve tried to include reasons where possible:\n\n### Create a custom mode just for flash if you have one spare\n\nSony has the great functionality where you can create a whole set of custom settings which you can recall at any point in time. That saves you having to change the settings on a regular basis. There are a couple of settings you are more likely to only use during flash so having the ability to switch these over automatically for when you use flash will save you a lot of time every time you have to change these settings. If you want to know how to do it, check out this video from [Mark Galer](http://www.markgaler.com/) that covers the setup of custom modes or memory recalls. Mark Galer is a respected Sony Ambassador and has some great video tutorials on his site so I\u2019d recommend having a look when you have time.\n\n### Switch off silent shooting\n\nGo to Camera Setting 2 (the camera with the 2 next to it), page 4/9 and the first option in the list will be silent shooting. You will need to switch off silent shooting. Flash doesn\u2019t work with an electronic shutter so the Sony system will not trigger the flash if it\u2019s switched on. Great for not annoying guests at weddings, terrible for flash work because your flash won\u2019t actually work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/aj4kh9c2d0j21.jpg\n\n### Switch off electronic front curtain shutter\n\nGo to Camera Setting 2 (the camera with the 2 next to it), page 4/9 and the second option in the list will be e-Front Curtain Shut. The front curtain shutter causes banding when used with HSS so its recommended that you switch off front curtain shutter and stick to mechanical when shooting flash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d58jvd64d0j21.jpg\n\n### Switch wireless off\n\nGo to Camera Setting 1 (the camera with the 1 next to it), page 11/14 entitled \u201cFlash\u201d and for the option called wireless and switch this off. The wireless option is for Sony\u2019s wireless speedlight system, not the Godox system. I haven\u2019t picked up any adverse reactions through having this on, but I have had speedlight issues so unless you are using Sony\u2019s wireless system, turn it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kke41rv5d0j21.jpg\n\n### Make sure the trigger or flash is seated properly\n\nOn occasion, you will encounter an issue where TTL or HSS won\u2019t work but the flash seems to be triggering fine. More often than not, this is as a result of the flash not being seated correctly. When you seat the flash or trigger, take the time to make sure it\u2019s seated properly.\n\n### Separate Exposure Compensation for Flash and Ambient\n\nGo to Camera Setting 1 (the camera with the 1 next to it), page 11/14 entitled \u201cFlash\u201d and for the option called Exp.comp.set ensure this is set to Ambient only. This is to separately the exposure compensation for ambient and flash because flash can be adjusted using the TTL settings on the flash or trigger and the ambient can be adjusted with the exposure compensation dial. Realistically you would have the ISO set to manual anyway, but in the beginning, this may not be the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/glmxron7d0j21.jpg\n\n&gt;***Flash Basics \u2013 Flash vs Ambient***  \n*If you don\u2019t know the difference, flash is where the light from flash is impacting, ambient is everywhere the flash isn\u2019t impacting. Imagine you are shooting a model in a forest; if you turn off the flash, that is ambient because the flash will only affect a portion of the photo. You need to be able to change this, because you may want to portray a scene as dark and moody with the highlight on the model, or just fill enough of the shadows to make it difficult to tell that flash was used. This is part of the creative process. The second issue is that the flash can sometimes impact ambient, so by separating these, you can change a setting without impacting the whole scene.*  \n*When you shoot flash, you need to adjust these independently if you aren\u2019t in manual mode. Eventually you will be in manual and this won\u2019t make a difference.*\n\n### Turn off Anti-Flicker Mode\n\nYes, I know it sounds strange but you have to turn off anti-flicker mode and there are some good reasons behind it. When you use anti-flicker, it interferes with the ability to turn the Shot Result Preview display on. I\u2019ll cover why in the next point. Go to Camera Setting 1, Page 14/14 and turn anti-flicker off.\n\n### Assign Shot Result Preview to a button if you shoot flash regularly.\n\nGo to Camera Setting 2, 8/9 (Custom Operation1) and select the first option which is for photos. Assign Shot Result Display to a button, I normally use C1 which is right now the shutter button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qlkr8g0bd0j21.jpg\n\nShot Result Display preview is the functionality that allow you to see what the exposure looks like. \u00a0If you\u2019re shooting indoors at f/8 1/250 and ISO100 with flash, the ambient is going to be pretty dark so you may not be able to see what you\u2019re shooting. Sony cameras are smart \u2013 When they detect a flash they turn off the live preview and there is a good reason behind it so now you can see as if you were looking at a perfectly exposed photo.\n\nBut that\u2019s a good and bad thing, because if you are shooting in a forest with a flash on the subject, you still want to see what the areas will look like that aren\u2019t getting flash and to do that, you\u2019re going to have to turn off the trigger the whole time, which may or may not cause some of the settings on the flashes to change. By assigning this to a button, you can switch it on the preview by holding down the button and it will show you what the ambient will look like for as long as you hold down the button.\n\n## HOW DO I SWITCH ON TTL?\n\nUsing TTL with the Godox system is relatively easy. All you have to do is setup the camera the way you want and then put on the flash or trigger, set the group to TTL and fire away. Provided you have changed the settings above, it should work.\n\nScroll through the wireless selection button (furthest right) and the mode button and the screen on the speedlight it should look like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yqub1rhcd0j21.jpg\n\nOn the trigger, it should look like this depending on how many groups you have set up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/rh4nqrged0j21.jpg\n\nAdditional considerations for speedlights\n\nFor speedlights, it is important to ensure that they are in the correct receiver/trigger setup.\n\n* If you are using it on camera, it needs to be setup so the flash is in receiver mode. The screen of the V860ii will change between orange and green depending on the mode it is in. For on camera, it should be in green.\n* If you are using it wirelessly, ensure that it is in wireless receiver mode, and the group and channel are set correctly. The screen on the V860ii will be orange in this mode with a flashing wireless sign in the top left corner.\n\nIf it looks like this, it won\u2019t work. This indicates it is being used as a controller.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bfyvjotfd0j21.jpg\n\n&gt;**Flash basics: What are groups and channels in flash?**  \nGroups and channels are used to ensure that you can only trigger a specific set of speedlights or strobes and you can adjust the settings of individual strobes or groups of strobes.  \nLet\u2019s take two hypothetical situations:  \nDifferent channel example: More than one person using wireless at the same location (a skateboard park as an example) \u2013 In this case you would use different channels to avoid interfering with each other if you were both using the same brand of lights because it is possible that he could trigger your lights  \nDifferent group example: Lets assume you are in a studio and you have 3 strobes setup. The one on the backdrop you may want at full power to make it white, the key light at half power and the hair light at one eighth power. To set the strobes up this way, you need to assign each to its own channel so you can adjust them independently.For more info on groups and channels, have a look at this [link](http://www.the-photography-blogger.com/groups-channels-flash-photography/).\n\n## HOW DO I SWITCH ON HSS?\n\nHSS can be switched on one of two ways, in manual or TTL. In TTL the HSS fires automatically when the shutter is higher than the sync speed which is 1/180 to 1/250 on most cameras.\n\nTo turn on HSS, click on the button assigned to sync and you will see a little bolt of lighting arrow with an H on it. You can see it below under the second \u201cm\u201d of the 24mm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/urczyuphd0j21.jpg\n\n&gt;**Flash Basics: What is HSS?**  \nHSS (High Speed Sync) is the ability to shoot photos faster than the sync speed of the camera and is typically used for action or photos where you are shooting into the sun with a shallow depth of field which requires a faster shutter. You can read more about it at this [link](https://www.exposureguide.com/high-speed-sync-flash/).\n\n## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### Set ISO manually and understand your flash power\n\nThe problem with most flash systems is that TTL doesn\u2019t use the full power of the flash. You can test easily by leaving auto ISO on and taking a photo with the flash bouncing off the ceiling.\n\nSet the camera to f/8, 1/250 and Auto ISO and take a photo with TTL. In a largish dark room, you will find the ISO rising to around 3200 or 6400.\n\nThen set your camera to f/8 1/250 and ISO100 and take a photo with TTL. The photo will likely be exposed at the same level (unless its a really large room, a small flash or a high ceiling) and yet, you have a much lower ISO.\n\nNow set the flash to manual and conduct the same exercise. If the flash photo is overexposed, it means the flash wasn\u2019t using full power at ISO100. What this means is you have to be careful about the use of auto ISO.\n\nOne option if you\u2019re not sure what ISO value to set based on the flash power is to set an acceptable level of ISO as a maximum, ISO800 as an example and let the camera push the ISO up to this maximum level. This will allow you some level of leeway without having to worry about the camera pushing the ISO up too high.\n\n## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n\n### I run two systems\u2026will my Sony specific V860ii S or V350 S work with my Nikon/Canon/Fujifilm etc.\n\nYes and no. It will only work in manual mode for on-camera flash, but it will work with TTL and HSS if you have the appropriate trigger. I.e. Canon Trigger with Canon Camera.\n\n### Can the speedlight be used as a transmitter?\n\nYes, they can, but the interface isn\u2019t that user-friendly. I\u2019d recommend getting a dedicated trigger.\n\n### Do I need TTL?\n\nIf you are asking that question, then yes, I\u2019d recommend getting TTL. Your learning curve will be much faster.\n\n### What lighting tutorials would you recommend?\n\nI\u2019d recommend starting with youtube, it\u2019s free. If you can\u2019t find what you want, try [http://www.kelbyone.com](http://www.kelbyone.com/)and have a look at some of the education streams that take you from beginner all the way up.\n\n### Can I charge the V350 or V860 by the USB port?\n\nNo, it\u2019s only for firmware. Batteries must be charged with the provided charger.\n\n### Where can I learn how to use individual speedlights or strobes from Godox?\n\nI\u2019d recommend [Robert Hall](https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallPD/videos) as a source for videos on individual Godox components. He has an [extensive library of videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallPD/videos) covering each of the speedlights and strobes.\n\n## KNOWN PROBLEMS\n\nI added this section after someone highlighted an error with the Godox V860 and I was able to validate it.\n\n### Sync speed issues over 1/250 with the A7riii (not sure if this occurs with other cameras) and the V860\n\nThe V860 seems to have an issue where the speedlight goes to full power when you have the speedlight on camera and the shutter goes to 1/250, even when HSS is set. If you use a wireless trigger, it seems to work fine with the same speedlight. I\u2019ve confirmed this error and will let you know if this is resolved through a firmware update.", "link":

articles, videos and sony flash articles with specific reference to the godox system and how to use it with sony cameras. like any camera system, there are unique ways the lighting system works and this can be confusing for many people.\n\ni\u2019ve noted this is specific to the a7iii and a7riii, however, this is due to these being the only two sony cameras i have. as a result, i can\u2019t test it across the entire range of sony cameras. it may or may not be applicable, feel free to try it out, it won\u2019t break anything.\n\ni will also try to update this article as time goes on, but if you feel anything is wrong here, please feel free to let me know, either via the comments or email. i might have missed something while writing it. if you know of any additional cameras from sony that would be supported in the same way and you can validate they work, let me know and i\u2019ll update the article to reflect compatibility.\n\n&gt;***note****: godox do rebrand their gear under a number of names, so this should also be applicable to flashpoint, neewer, adorama and cheetah although i can\u2019t tell you the exact models*\n\ni\u2019ve tried to cover an overview of the most commonly used godox gear first, along with some recommendations on what i believe are the best first purchases if you plan on buying into the godox system with sony. after the gear port of the article, i\u2019ve moved straight into the use with sony, so feel free to skip the gear section if you feel this is irrelevant.\n\n## flash basics\n\nwhen i wrote this article, i realised that the audience in some cases may be new to flash. as a result, i\u2019ve included fairly basic descriptions of what i consider \u201cflash basics\u201d at certain points in the article. these will be relevant to a specific area i am writing about and will help extend the knowledge for a novice. these are not comprehensive detailed descriptions so you may need to research these further if you don\u2019t understand. they are areas that more experienced photographers will already know and as a result, to avoid boring the crap out of the more experienced photographers, i\u2019ve included these in a box entitled \u201cflash basics\u201d. an example of a subject i am talking about is \u201cwhat is flash vs ambient\u201d. in some cases, i\u2019ve written a short description, in others, i\u2019ve just pointed to a video that covers these areas well enough that it\u2019s pointless me writing about it.\n\nif you are someone who has used flash extensively, feel free to ignore them, and i\u2019ve put them in blocks to make it easier to identify them. they have a bolded \u201cflash basics\u201d that looks like this:\n\n&gt;***flash basics: sample***  \n*this is a sample example of flash basics description*\n\n# an overview of godox speedlights, strobes and triggers\n\none of the greatest advantages of the godox system is the ability to mix and match speedlights and strobes with a variety of camera systems, along with the low-cost entry point for people looking to experiment or start using lighting for the first time. many of the strobe brands do not manufacture speedlights and many speedlight brands do not manufacture strobes. godox (along with profoto) is one of the few to provide both options. i\u2019ve tried to cover all speedlights, strobes, and triggers here, and i will continue to update these as time goes on, and new models arrive, but please understand i\u2019m not planning to buy every speedlight and strobe they manufacture so my hands-on experience with some models may be limited. \u00a0i have not covered the non-battery studio models of their strobe lineup.\n\n&gt;***flash basics \u2013 speedlights vs strobes***  \n*the difference between these two has always been blurred, more so in recent years. do a search on google and you\u2019ll find 5 different definitions. some people consider the difference to be the power output; others whether it has a cable or battery, for some it\u2019s whether it has a fresnel or globe head.*  \n*i couldn\u2019t find any definitive definition which is part of the challenge. as a result, lets assume for the sake of this article that a speedlight is a lightweight flash that can be used on camera and the strobe is a high-powered flash designed to be used off camera. it\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t put a speedlight off camera, but you can\u2019t put a strobe on camera.*\n\n### speedlight options\n\nwith godox\u2019s speedlight lineup, there are only 2 sizes for godox, each with sub-options. you have a small low powered flash and a larger full powered flash. for each of these, there is a sub option with aa batteries or a godox rechargeable battery option, but they\u2019re essentially the same or similar model with different battery options/\n\ntypically in the speedlight range, a tt version is an aa battery version and a v version is one supplied with a rechargeable battery. \u00a0in the case of some (like the tt350/v350), the names match however with the v860 and tt685, they don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t ask me why. the s indicates sony version, although they are compatible with other cameras if used with the brand specific trigger. i.e. you can trigger a sony flash on a fujifilm camera with a fujifilm trigger.\n\n#### godox tt350s/v350s\n\nthe godox tt350s and v350s are similar the same unit, however, the v350s version comes with a battery and charger whilst the tt350s uses 2 aa batteries.\u00a0the v350s goes for $159 and the tt350s goes for $89.\n\nthe small flash is more suited to the size of the sony mirrorless cameras, however, these units have a limited amount of power, about 2 stops worse than the larger brother, and this, in turn, will limit your capability with the speedlight. i\u2019m personally not a huge fan of on camera flash, so i would avoid this option unless you intend using it as an on camera flash for travel where you need to keep the weight down. long term, i think most users will outgrow the capability of the speedlight fairly quickly, so unless you\u2019re a point and shoot photographer with no intentions of ever taking the flash off your camera, go for the v860 which i cover in the next section.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/aacqnammc0j21.jpg\n\ni would recommend the internal rechargeable over the aa version if you do go for this model. the recharge time between flashes is faster and the batteries can produce more full-powered flashes per charge. the version that comes with rechargeable batteries is more expensive for obvious reasons.\n\n#### godox tt685s/v860iis\n\nthe tt688s and x are the full powered speedlights godox\u2019s range offering a power output of 85ws, hence the 85 in the name. whilst the 685 is large, it also offers what i consider the minimum acceptable power for any decent flash work.\n\nas with the tt350, the 685 is offered in two different versions, an aa version, and a rechargeable version. the v860iis goes for $189 whilst the tt685s goes for $110. as you can see from the pricing, there is only a small premium for the v860 over the v350 with a substantial power increase, and as a result, unless size is a constraint, i\u2019d recommend buying the more powerful version.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0fwkntinc0j21.jpg\n\nimportant note: the tt685 and v860ii are prone to hotshoe breaks for some obscure reason. if this does occur, hotshoes can be purchased separately and at a fairly low cost. i haven\u2019t had to replace mine as i do not do much on-camera flash, but i\u2019d recommend carrying a spare speedlight if you shoot weddings. for more information on replacing the hotshoe, have a look at this article and video.\n\n&gt;**important note:** the larger godox speedlights are known to have hotshoe breakage issues for people who use them heavily.  \nif this occurs, you can buy replacement hotshoes on [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/new-hot-shoe-mounting-foot-for-godox-v860iis-v860-s-flash-speedlite-repair-parts-/182728975320) or at your local godox stockist. there are many videos that show the replacement process on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5xkzbsvuo).\n\n### strobe options (200ws+ options)\n\ngodox has a good range of strobes, but for the purpose of this, i\u2019m going to focus on the battery-powered strobes which include the ad200, ad360, ad400 and ad600/ad600 pro. the name indicates the power output of the strobe. i.e. the ad200 has 200ws of power whilst the ad600 has 600ws.\n\n#### godox ad200\n\nthe ad200 is the most popular strobe from godox due to the compact size and high-powered output. it\u2019s provided in a case with both a fresnel and bulb head, along with a bracket to mount it on a light stand. if you are looking to get into off-camera flash, this is where i would start. it\u2019s small, flexible and lightweight, and you can carry 3 with you without breaking a sweat. the ad200 retails for around us$300 without a trigger which is pretty reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z5z2ohipc0j21.jpg\n\nbattery power on the ad200 is very good. i\u2019ve used two of these in a forest with 4 fellow photographers and about 1,000 pops without draining the battery but ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the power output.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1s80w83rc0j21.jpg\n\none of the great things with the ad200 is that godox offer a bowens bracket with built in modelling lamp that allows you to combine two ad200\u2019s into a single 400ws strobe. that gives you the flexibility of having a single ad400 and two ad200\u2019s depending on what you are planning to do.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kbanlhzrc0j21.jpg\n\n#### godox ad400\n\nthe ad400 was released in 2018 and is new to the godox lineup. it falls cleanly between the ad200 and ad600. the ad400 starts to bridge into a territory of being too large to carry around in your camera bag, due to the increased thickness which is twice as thick as the ad200.\n\ni don\u2019t have hands-on experience with this model, but many of photographers i know that have purchased these love them.\n\nin comparison to the ad600 pro, i would question whether you will need 600ws of power. the ad400 should be sufficient for most situations. my magbox review consisted of two ad200\u2019s shooting into the sun and it was more than enough power to overpower the sun so it would have to be some pretty brutal light or a large softbox to need more than this.\n\n#### godox ad600/ad600 pro (available in ttl or manual/hss)\n\nthe ad600 and ad600 pro models are the most powerful strobes in godox\u2019s lineup that consist of a built-in battery as opposed to an external battery pack. the pro version is a recent upgrade to the ad6oo and offers more stable colour temperature and faster recycle times. the ad600 series comes with a weight premium over the smaller models.\n\nthe ad600 (non-pro) comes in a manual version which includes hss, or a ttl version which includes hss. they used to offer it in a unique godox or bowens mount, but the godox mount seems to have been phased out in favour of bowens mount. if you have the option of both, i\u2019d recommend a ttl bowens mount.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ph1pksntc0j21.jpg\n\n#### common godox strobe accessories\n\ngodox offer some nice accessories for the ad series of strobes. these include extension cables to take the strobe bulb off the head of the strobe and extend it on a cable with the strobe unit becoming a battery pack. this is great for keeping weight off the head in stronger winds or when you have an assistant hand holding a softbox on a boom and they aren\u2019t superman.\n\n### triggers\n\ngodox has two triggers which i have covered below. if you want to skip this section and know which to buy,\u00a0buy the xpro s, it\u2019s worth the additional cost over the x1s. if buying the xpro is going to mean you can feed yourself, get the x1, it\u2019ll do most of what the xpro can do, but it\u2019s not nearly as intuitive or well designed.\n\nthe godox speedlights can also be used as triggers but i\u2019d recommend using a dedicated trigger for usability reasons.\n\n#### godox x1 s trigger\n\nthe x1 is the original trigger from godox. i had this when i was shooting nikon, and when i shot with fujifilm but switched to the xpro when it was released. it\u2019s a good trigger, but with the availability of the xpro trigger, i wouldn\u2019t recommend it for the simple reason that you can get a far better trigger for a minimal amount more and it is worth the difference.\n\nthe x1 trigger offers full control over the godox tangle of speedlights and strobes with the ability to switch between manual and ttl and it\u2019s capable of triggering hss with compatible cameras.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f454v99vc0j21.jpg\n\nwhilst the x1 is capable of doing the job, it has some small annoyances which is why i recommend the xpro:\n\n1. for one, the trigger sits flat on the hot shoe which limits access to some of the controls on the camera. this is less of an issue with sony but with fujifilm, the top dials were more critical.\n2. the second big annoyance is the rear dials one the trigger bump your head when looking through the viewfinder and are accidentally adjusted\n3. usability is far worse \u2013 the xpro is more intuitive\n\n#### godox xpro\u00a0s trigger\n\nthe xpro\u00a0s is what i consider v2 of the x1 trigger and a far better design. in conjunction to the functionality offered with the x1 trigger, the xpro offers:\n\n1. ttl to manual \u2013 the ability to take the current ttl settings and switch over to complete manual allowing you more control if you are not happy with some of the refinements in ttl. this reduces the requirement for a light meter.  \nsmaller increments\n2. from a usability perspective, the xpro wins heads and shoulders over the x1, it\u2019s almost hard to compare the two, like a beta and a final version.\n3. you can zoom in so only the current group is shown on-screen if you aren\u2019t using multiple groups\n4. the design offers more of a slanted upright view, ensuring the trigger is kept away from the controls and your forehead\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/osytp12yc0j21.jpg\n\n### receivers\n\nall of the strobes and speedlights covered in this article have receivers built into the flash unit.\n\n### do i buy ttl or manual?\n\nthis will probably be controversial, but some of the seasoned professionals are going to tell you \u201cdon\u2019t worry about ttl, no professional uses ttl\u201d. i\u2019m going to respectfully disagree with these people, many of whom have never actually shot with a ttl strobe. for them, it\u2019s about the comfort of doing things they way they have always done and the discomfort with losing control, but like anything, technology changes and ttl has matured to a point where it is pro-ready. think of it like mirrorless. the initial mirrorless cameras were basic consumer grade cameras, but now mirrorless is good enough for professional use and the same applies to ttl. its matured and in many cases is capable of making decisions more accurately due to its ability to adapt to changing lighting conditions. using ttl isn\u2019t about losing control, you have the same level of control in dynamic situations. i.e. sun goes behind the clouds and all of a sudden, your lighting needs to change, but with ttl, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nin short, if you know enough about strobes to know what you need, buy whatever you want, if you don\u2019t, buy the ttl version. best case scenario, you buy ttl and don\u2019t use it, worst case, you buy manual and need ttl and don\u2019t have it.\n\n&gt;**flash basics: what is ttl?**  \nttl (through the lens) is where the flash automatically decides how much exposure to use based on what it see\u2019s through the lens. the idea is you set up the depth of field and shutter, and ttl will try ensure you get a perfectly exposed image. here is a simple explanation of ttl on [youtube](https://youtu.be/vnu-qhiyp5o)\n\n### what godox gear would i recommend buying?\n\nif you\u2019re an experience flash photographer you can probably skip this section because you should have a fair idea of what you need.\n\n* if you are on a limited budget and have no experience with the flash, you could start with the tt350 or v350, but overall, if your budget isn\u2019t limited i\u2019d recommend getting the v860ii instead because it is a little better from a future-proofing perspective.\n* if you want a recommended starting point for getting into off camera flash, i\u2019d recommended starting point would be an ad200 and an xpro trigger. this will give you a starting point with a powerful enough flash to grow into decent softboxes. it is also powerful enough to overpower the sun in many situations and can be doubled up with another one in a godox supplied bracket for a 400ws strobe.\n* if you have a good budget, i\u2019d say get a single ad600\u00a0pro and two ad200\u2019s or ad400\u2019s, depending on how many lights you need. you could also get a v860ii which could double as a 4th light due to the interoperability of the lights.\n\n&gt;***flash basics: what about modifiers should i buy?***\u00a0  \n*flash modifiers is a massive topic in itself \u2013 you could write an entire article dedicated to it. for the sake of keeping it simple, if you\u2019re new to lighting, i\u2019d recommend starting with the* [*40 or 60cm square softbox if you have a speedlight*](http://www.godox.com/en/products_s_type_speedlite_bracket.html)*, or an 80-90cm octa (round) softbox if you are buying a strobe. my preference for larger softboxes is the magbox or rimelite due to the ease at which they can be set up but they also come with a big price premium. if you can\u2019t afford these, a basic godox model would be adequate.*\n\n# how to get going with flash on your sony gear\n\n## pre-settings to avoid common problems\n\nwhen using the godox system with your sony camera, there are a couple of things you need to set up on your camera to avoid problems. i\u2019ve tried to include reasons where possible:\n\n### create a custom mode just for flash if you have one spare\n\nsony has the great functionality where you can create a whole set of custom settings which you can recall at any point in time. that saves you having to change the settings on a regular basis. there are a couple of settings you are more likely to only use during flash so having the ability to switch these over automatically for when you use flash will save you a lot of time every time you have to change these settings. if you want to know how to do it, check out this video from [mark galer](http://www.markgaler.com/) that covers the setup of custom modes or memory recalls. mark galer is a respected sony ambassador and has some great video tutorials on his site so i\u2019d recommend having a look when you have time.\n\n### switch off silent shooting\n\ngo to camera setting 2 (the camera with the 2 next to it), page 4/9 and the first option in the list will be silent shooting. you will need to switch off silent shooting. flash doesn\u2019t work with an electronic shutter so the sony system will not trigger the flash if it\u2019s switched on. great for not annoying guests at weddings, terrible for flash work because your flash won\u2019t actually work.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/aj4kh9c2d0j21.jpg\n\n### switch off electronic front curtain shutter\n\ngo to camera setting 2 (the camera with the 2 next to it), page 4/9 and the second option in the list will be e-front curtain shut. the front curtain shutter causes banding when used with hss so its recommended that you switch off front curtain shutter and stick to mechanical when shooting flash.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d58jvd64d0j21.jpg\n\n### switch wireless off\n\ngo to camera setting 1 (the camera with the 1 next to it), page 11/14 entitled \u201cflash\u201d and for the option called wireless and switch this off. the wireless option is for sony\u2019s wireless speedlight system, not the godox system. i haven\u2019t picked up any adverse reactions through having this on, but i have had speedlight issues so unless you are using sony\u2019s wireless system, turn it off.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kke41rv5d0j21.jpg\n\n### make sure the trigger or flash is seated properly\n\non occasion, you will encounter an issue where ttl or hss won\u2019t work but the flash seems to be triggering fine. more often than not, this is as a result of the flash not being seated correctly. when you seat the flash or trigger, take the time to make sure it\u2019s seated properly.\n\n### separate exposure compensation for flash and ambient\n\ngo to camera setting 1 (the camera with the 1 next to it), page 11/14 entitled \u201cflash\u201d and for the option called exp.comp.set ensure this is set to ambient only. this is to separately the exposure compensation for ambient and flash because flash can be adjusted using the ttl settings on the flash or trigger and the ambient can be adjusted with the exposure compensation dial. realistically you would have the iso set to manual anyway, but in the beginning, this may not be the case.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/glmxron7d0j21.jpg\n\n&gt;***flash basics \u2013 flash vs ambient***  \n*if you don\u2019t know the difference, flash is where the light from flash is impacting, ambient is everywhere the flash isn\u2019t impacting. imagine you are shooting a model in a forest; if you turn off the flash, that is ambient because the flash will only affect a portion of the photo. you need to be able to change this, because you may want to portray a scene as dark and moody with the highlight on the model, or just fill enough of the shadows to make it difficult to tell that flash was used. this is part of the creative process. the second issue is that the flash can sometimes impact ambient, so by separating these, you can change a setting without impacting the whole scene.*  \n*when you shoot flash, you need to adjust these independently if you aren\u2019t in manual mode. eventually you will be in manual and this won\u2019t make a difference.*\n\n### turn off anti-flicker mode\n\nyes, i know it sounds strange but you have to turn off anti-flicker mode and there are some good reasons behind it. when you use anti-flicker, it interferes with the ability to turn the shot result preview display on. i\u2019ll cover why in the next point. go to camera setting 1, page 14/14 and turn anti-flicker off.\n\n### assign shot result preview to a button if you shoot flash regularly.\n\ngo to camera setting 2, 8/9 (custom operation1) and select the first option which is for photos. assign shot result display to a button, i normally use c1 which is right now the shutter button.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qlkr8g0bd0j21.jpg\n\nshot result display preview is the functionality that allow you to see what the exposure looks like. \u00a0if you\u2019re shooting indoors at f/8 1/250 and iso100 with flash, the ambient is going to be pretty dark so you may not be able to see what you\u2019re shooting. sony cameras are smart \u2013 when they detect a flash they turn off the live preview and there is a good reason behind it so now you can see as if you were looking at a perfectly exposed photo.\n\nbut that\u2019s a good and bad thing, because if you are shooting in a forest with a flash on the subject, you still want to see what the areas will look like that aren\u2019t getting flash and to do that, you\u2019re going to have to turn off the trigger the whole time, which may or may not cause some of the settings on the flashes to change. by assigning this to a button, you can switch it on the preview by holding down the button and it will show you what the ambient will look like for as long as you hold down the button.\n\n## how do i switch on ttl?\n\nusing ttl with the godox system is relatively easy. all you have to do is setup the camera the way you want and then put on the flash or trigger, set the group to ttl and fire away. provided you have changed the settings above, it should work.\n\nscroll through the wireless selection button (furthest right) and the mode button and the screen on the speedlight it should look like this:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yqub1rhcd0j21.jpg\n\non the trigger, it should look like this depending on how many groups you have set up\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/rh4nqrged0j21.jpg\n\nadditional considerations for speedlights\n\nfor speedlights, it is important to ensure that they are in the correct receiver/trigger setup.\n\n* if you are using it on camera, it needs to be setup so the flash is in receiver mode. the screen of the v860ii will change between orange and green depending on the mode it is in. for on camera, it should be in green.\n* if you are using it wirelessly, ensure that it is in wireless receiver mode, and the group and channel are set correctly. the screen on the v860ii will be orange in this mode with a flashing wireless sign in the top left corner.\n\nif it looks like this, it won\u2019t work. this indicates it is being used as a controller.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bfyvjotfd0j21.jpg\n\n&gt;**flash basics: what are groups and channels in flash?**  \ngroups and channels are used to ensure that you can only trigger a specific set of speedlights or strobes and you can adjust the settings of individual strobes or groups of strobes.  \nlet\u2019s take two hypothetical situations:  \ndifferent channel example: more than one person using wireless at the same -----> location !!!  (a skateboard park as an example) \u2013 in this case you would use different channels to avoid interfering with each other if you were both using the same brand of lights because it is possible that he could trigger your lights  \ndifferent group example: lets assume you are in a studio and you have 3 strobes setup. the one on the backdrop you may want at full power to make it white, the key light at half power and the hair light at one eighth power. to set the strobes up this way, you need to assign each to its own channel so you can adjust them independently.for more info on groups and channels, have a look at this [link](http://www.the-photography-blogger.com/groups-channels-flash-photography/).\n\n## how do i switch on hss?\n\nhss can be switched on one of two ways, in manual or ttl. in ttl the hss fires automatically when the shutter is higher than the sync speed which is 1/180 to 1/250 on most cameras.\n\nto turn on hss, click on the button assigned to sync and you will see a little bolt of lighting arrow with an h on it. you can see it below under the second \u201cm\u201d of the 24mm\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/urczyuphd0j21.jpg\n\n&gt;**flash basics: what is hss?**  \nhss (high speed sync) is the ability to shoot photos faster than the sync speed of the camera and is typically used for action or photos where you are shooting into the sun with a shallow depth of field which requires a faster shutter. you can read more about it at this [link](https://www.exposureguide.com/high-speed-sync-flash/).\n\n## other considerations\n\n### set iso manually and understand your flash power\n\nthe problem with most flash systems is that ttl doesn\u2019t use the full power of the flash. you can test easily by leaving auto iso on and taking a photo with the flash bouncing off the ceiling.\n\nset the camera to f/8, 1/250 and auto iso and take a photo with ttl. in a largish dark room, you will find the iso rising to around 3200 or 6400.\n\nthen set your camera to f/8 1/250 and iso100 and take a photo with ttl. the photo will likely be exposed at the same level (unless its a really large room, a small flash or a high ceiling) and yet, you have a much lower iso.\n\nnow set the flash to manual and conduct the same exercise. if the flash photo is overexposed, it means the flash wasn\u2019t using full power at iso100. what this means is you have to be careful about the use of auto iso.\n\none option if you\u2019re not sure what iso value to set based on the flash power is to set an acceptable level of iso as a maximum, iso800 as an example and let the camera push the iso up to this maximum level. this will allow you some level of leeway without having to worry about the camera pushing the iso up too high.\n\n## frequently asked questions:\n\n### i run two systems\u2026will my sony specific v860ii s or v350 s work with my nikon/canon/fujifilm etc.\n\nyes and no. it will only work in manual mode for on-camera flash, but it will work with ttl and hss if you have the appropriate trigger. i.e. canon trigger with canon camera.\n\n### can the speedlight be used as a transmitter?\n\nyes, they can, but the interface isn\u2019t that user-friendly. i\u2019d recommend getting a dedicated trigger.\n\n### do i need ttl?\n\nif you are asking that question, then yes, i\u2019d recommend getting ttl. your learning curve will be much faster.\n\n### what lighting tutorials would you recommend?\n\ni\u2019d recommend starting with youtube, it\u2019s free. if you can\u2019t find what you want, try [http://www.kelbyone.com](http://www.kelbyone.com/)and have a look at some of the education streams that take you from beginner all the way up.\n\n### can i charge the v350 or v860 by the usb port?\n\nno, it\u2019s only for firmware. batteries must be charged with the provided charger.\n\n### where can i learn how to use individual speedlights or strobes from godox?\n\ni\u2019d recommend [robert hall](https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallpd/videos) as a source for videos on individual godox components. he has an [extensive library of videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallpd/videos) covering each of the speedlights and strobes.\n\n## known problems\n\ni added this section after someone highlighted an error with the godox v860 and i was able to validate it.\n\n### sync speed issues over 1/250 with the a7riii (not sure if this occurs with other cameras) and the v860\n\nthe v860 seems to have an issue where the speedlight goes to full power when you have the speedlight on camera and the shutter goes to 1/250, even when hss is set. if you use a wireless trigger, it seems to work fine with the same speedlight. i\u2019ve confirmed this error and will let you know if this is resolved through a firmware update.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 22318, "year": "2019"}], "name": "locationSonyAlpha2019"}
