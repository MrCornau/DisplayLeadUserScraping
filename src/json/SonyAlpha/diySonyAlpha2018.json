Currently I'm using the Sigma 16mm f/1.4 and the Sony 35 mm f/1.8. \n\nThey are brilliant lenses, though I do want something with a bit more reach and \"flattening\", for both portraits as well as city detail shots. \n\nThe go-to portrait lens on APS-C Sony bodies seems to be the 50mm f/1.8 OSS. I tried a friend's copy the other day, and it's a nice lens, but I didn't get the impression that it was doing anything my 35mm f/1.8 couldn't already do with some cropping. And for anything outside of portraits, I often either found it too long or too short. \n\nIt is cheap though, and a long focal length wouldn't be my daily shooter (the 16 or 35 would still be my walk-aroundds). So from a cost to actual use perspective, it seems like the right choice. \n\nHowever, the FE 85mm f/1.8 is also interesting. I'm not sure if the focal length would be crazy limiting on APS-C (127.5mm equivalent), but it seems like that ~135mm length on full-frame is often used for portraits. This lens also seems like a bokeh monster. \n\nMy questions about it are:\n\n* How far back do you need to stand to get a waist-up portrait on APS-C?\n* How far back do you need to stand to get a full-body portrait?\n* If you have to be really far back, do you find yourself limited by lighting? Since things like the pop-up flash with a DIY diffuser might be too far to be useful\n* Is the lack of OSS a huge limiter for getting clear shots, especially in the evening/night. \n\n\nMy other qualm about the 85 is the price. I know it is generally considered great value for FF bodies, but I feel like it would be my least used lens (probably only about 15-20% of the time), and $550 would be my most expensive lens. \n\nOne other option is to wait for a new Sigma APS-C release - I heard that after the 16 f/1.4 and 30 f/1.4, Sigma plans to release a short-telephoto f/1.4 lens, but it's unclear what the time frame of release would be. Could be a year for all I know. \n\nI know the 60 f/2.8 exists, but I think that's too slow for the bokeh I want. \n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/81zz5s/lens_question_sony_fe_85mm_f18_vs_50mm_f18_oss/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "[lens question] sony fe 85mm f/1.8 vs 50mm f/1.8 oss for portraits on a6300 /!/ hey all,\n\ni'm looking in to buying my third prime for my a6300, primarily for portraits (both head &amp; shoulders type things as well as full body ones with lots of bokeh). currently i'm using the sigma 16mm f/1.4 and the sony 35 mm f/1.8. \n\nthey are brilliant lenses, though i do want something with a bit more reach and \"flattening\", for both portraits as well as city detail shots. \n\nthe go-to portrait lens on aps-c sony bodies seems to be the 50mm f/1.8 oss. i tried a friend's copy the other day, and it's a nice lens, but i didn't get the impression that it was doing anything my 35mm f/1.8 couldn't already do with some cropping. and for anything outside of portraits, i often either found it too long or too short. \n\nit is cheap though, and a long focal length wouldn't be my daily shooter (the 16 or 35 would still be my walk-aroundds). so from a cost to actual use perspective, it seems like the right choice. \n\nhowever, the fe 85mm f/1.8 is also interesting. i'm not sure if the focal length would be crazy limiting on aps-c (127.5mm equivalent), but it seems like that ~135mm length on full-frame is often used for portraits. this lens also seems like a bokeh monster. \n\nmy questions about it are:\n\n* how far back do you need to stand to get a waist-up portrait on aps-c?\n* how far back do you need to stand to get a full-body portrait?\n* if you have to be really far back, do you find yourself limited by lighting? since things like the pop-up flash with a -----> diy !!!  diffuser might be too far to be useful\n* is the lack of oss a huge limiter for getting clear shots, especially in the evening/night. \n\n\nmy other qualm about the 85 is the price. i know it is generally considered great value for ff bodies, but i feel like it would be my least used lens (probably only about 15-20% of the time), and $550 would be my most expensive lens. \n\none other option is to wait for a new sigma aps-c release - i heard that after the 16 f/1.4 and 30 f/1.4, sigma plans to release a short-telephoto f/1.4 lens, but it's unclear what the time frame of release would be. could be a year for all i know. \n\ni know the 60 f/2.8 exists, but i think that's too slow for the bokeh i want. \n\nthanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 35668, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "jefflan", "date": "2018-12-24 02:21:16", "content": "DIY Gift ideas every Photographer will love!
