This allows you to record audio wirelessly. From my research into the MIS (Multi-Interface Shoe), the audio pins are analog.  \n\n\nAnd the exposed pins on the SMAD seem to be very simple: [https://imgur.com/a/tZuuw8C](https://imgur.com/a/tZuuw8C)  \n\n\nIt might be as simple as soldering a 3.5mm jack to those exposed pins. Even better, a case could be 3D printed to go onto of the SMAD, hold the 3.5mm jack, and integrate a hot shoe mount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you think this would work or any potential flaws with my plan.
