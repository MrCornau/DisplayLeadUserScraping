I usually use \"multi\" metering mode, which works most of the time. Like described above, sometimes the camera overexposes by 1 to 2 stops when shooting shadow areas. In reality those areas are much darker but the camera tries to expose them as average.\n\nFor example I recently shot a soccer game. It was a very sunny noon. One site of the soccer field was under the shadows of the trees behind it. When shooting players in those darker areas, the camera (set on multi metering) overexposes like this:\n\n https://imgur.com/RN4mwgF   \n https://imgur.com/SbpgRz5 \n\nLook at how the grass is blown out.
