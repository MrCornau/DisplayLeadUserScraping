I say prime lens because one of the reasons I'm switching to Sony from my Nikon D600 is that I travel quite a bit and do a lot of hiking/backcountry skiing, so a smaller/lighter setup is something I've been needing for awhile. I love my Nikon 50mm 2.8 so I was thinking of keeping that and just buying an adapter, but I need another wider prime lens. Again, I know there's a ton of these posts so I'll try and cover most of the questions that I've seen other posters be asked:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\- I shoot mainly landscape and long exposure, so a wider lens is preferred as I'll have the 50mm to get any street shots that I sometimes do as well. I really don't do any video or action stuff so MF would be fine, I almost always set up my shots for a while anyways.\n\n \\- My budget is around $1000, I still need to get the A7iii body and while I have the funds, it physically hurts me to spend money even on something I love like photography. That's also my budget for one lens, as I'd rather spend more on something really quality than get 2 mediocre lenses I might end up hating.\n\n \\- I could be swayed to get a zoom but like I said, I really like the smaller nature of prime lenses and genuinely don't mind the fact that I have to zoom with my feet sometimes, I think it helps me develop as a photographer. In my experience primes are also generally sharper than zooms, but feel free to correct me if that's an incorrect thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would appreciate any help, I'm pretty new to this subreddit but I've always loved checking out the photos you guys put out.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/c4z2v7/prime_lens_for_a7iii/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "me develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "prime lens for a7iii /!/ i know there's probably a lot of these types of posts (i've read a ton) but i'm looking to buy an a7iii and would like some recommendations on a lens or two. i say prime lens because one of the reasons i'm switching to sony from my nikon d600 is that i travel quite a bit and do a lot of hiking/backcountry skiing, so a smaller/lighter setup is something i've been needing for awhile. i love my nikon 50mm 2.8 so i was thinking of keeping that and just buying an adapter, but i need another wider prime lens. again, i know there's a ton of these posts so i'll try and cover most of the questions that i've seen other posters be asked:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n \\- i shoot mainly landscape and long exposure, so a wider lens is preferred as i'll have the 50mm to get any street shots that i sometimes do as well. i really don't do any video or action stuff so mf would be fine, i almost always set up my shots for a while anyways.\n\n \\- my budget is around $1000, i still need to get the a7iii body and while i have the funds, it physically hurts me to spend money even on something i love like photography. that's also my budget for one lens, as i'd rather spend more on something really quality than get 2 mediocre lenses i might end up hating.\n\n \\- i could be swayed to get a zoom but like i said, i really like the smaller nature of prime lenses and genuinely don't mind the fact that i have to zoom with my feet sometimes, i think it helps -----> me !!!  -----> develop !!!  as a photographer. in my experience primes are also generally sharper than zooms, but feel free to correct me if that's an incorrect thought.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni would appreciate any help, i'm pretty new to this subreddit but i've always loved checking out the photos you guys put out.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 12747, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "Kilgoretrout321", "date": "2019-04-24 20:32:25", "content": "Looking to Acquire Minolta Mc/Md lens /!/ Anyone tired of their Minolta lens?

The frame I selected was shot on Ilford HP5+ and developed at 1600 ISO in Ilfotec DD-X. I chose the frame because the exposure is good, the focus is fairly sharp, and it's fairly grainy, so you should be able to see whether or not the grain is properly resolved.\n\nThe three scanners I have are: a Nikon Coolscan V ED running Nikon Scan, an Epson V550 (which has the same specs as a V600) running Epson Scan, and a Fuji X-T3 mirrorless camera in a camera-scanning rig using a Schneider Componon-S 80mm f5.6 enlarging lens and processed with Negative Lab Pro. All images were processed without any additional sharpening (aside from the default sharpening that Lightroom applies to RAW files for the Fuji capture, which I've toned down by default).\n\nThe Coolscan image was scanned at 4000dpi, the Epson V550 image was scanned at 4800dpi, and the X-T3 is a 26 megapixel camera, although the capture was cropped, so it's safe to assume the effective resolution is a little lower than that.\n\nKeep in mind the main thing I'm trying to compare here is resolution, which is why I chose a black and white image and not a colour image. I feel like colour is such a subjective thing and can easily be manipulated no matter what scanner you use.\n\nHere are the tests, which consist of 1:1 crops of select areas of the frame:  \n[Nikon Coolscan V ED vs Fuji X-T3 camera scan resolution test](https://imgur.com/a/55YgSYS)  \n[Fuji X-T3 camera scan vs Epson V550 resolution test](https://imgur.com/a/GPKar6X)\n\nI think there are some definite takeaways here, most of which probably won't be all that surprising. Also keep in mind that while I do feel confident in the general performance of my camera scanning rig, I do think there's a lot of room for improvement on my end. I'll also say that the Coolscan is the scanner I use when I digitize 35mm, even though camera scanning can be a little quicker.

Would appreciate guidance /!/ Hi all, I'm about to develop my first roll of film ever. Before I crack into it I want to ask some questions to make sure I have everything straight\n\nThe developer I purchased is called r09 spezial and comes in a 120ml bottle with recommendations to dilute 1:15. For my film (Ilford hp5) the packaging says I should develop for 4 minutes so I was going to aim for that. The fixer I have is Ilford rapid fixer. For the stop bath I was just going to use water. My house is currently 15C degrees instead of the 20C degrees the chemicals ask for so I was going to try and do a water bath for all the chemicals.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1) 1:15 dilution is awkward to work out in my head but I think that means I add in 66.666ml and then top that up to 1L total with water. The bottle itself is 120ml so I was going to aim for about half the bottle. Is this right?\n\n2) when I pour out my developer how much water do I use for a stop bath and how much should I agitate? \nI was going to fill it up once, agitate it for 10-15seconds, pour out the water and rinse the tank one or two more times whilst agitating lightly. Does this sound about right? \n\n3) how long do I fix for? The bottle recommends 2-5minutes but that's a huge variance and I don't know enough to know when to opt for 2mins Vs 5mins. I was going to split the difference and aim for 3.5mins, does this sound reasonable?\n\n4) both the developer and fixing agent can be reused at a later time right? So when I finish each step I should pour them back into their containers not down the drain.\n\n5) if I mess up can the images be recovered? I have two rolls of hp5 which I was going to do at the same time but I recognise there's a decent chance I'll mess this up since it's my first time and I'd rather not lose both sets of images. Would you recommend doing one roll as a test or should I just do both? \n\n6) Should I lengthen my times to account for the cold environment even if I use a water bath? (My thinking is the cold environment might cool down the chemicals after they've been added to the tank since the tank won't be in the water bath)\n\n7) can I use the same funnel for everything provided I rinse it between uses? \n\n8)when I'm loading the film onto the qspools can I touch it with my fingers or will that leave large smudges on the film? l accidentally smudged some negatives on the first roll I shot but I'm not sure if it only becomes sensitive like this after its developed or not. I was going to try handle it by the edges anyway but it would be useful if I could handle it however I wanted.\n\n9) any other tips/ things to watch out for?\n\nI know there's a lot of questions so thanks for reading through and if you have the answer to any of the above please let me know.

All you need to do is follow these four steps:  - Look at the image and identity which elements are cathing your attention for longer than 2 seconds; - Imagine how you can enhance the story behind the frame; - Use editing software (Lightroom and Photoshop) to create the image you imagine; -Print the frame to see the final result (it doesn't have to be an expensive print).   I have been using these 4 steps for more than a decade, and it is amazing how much it helped me.   I am sure these tips will push you through that plateau in no time, and it will make you get back to creating images that you are proud to show people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/RCjHfWWKDUg](https://youtu.be/RCjHfWWKDUg)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/lflk3g/dear_photographers_use_these_4_steps_to_improve/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i have finally developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "dear photographers, use these 4 steps to improve your craft. /!/ have you reached a plateau in your photography? do you feel stuck, and no matter what you try, you feel like you can't create better images?   trust me, every photographer goes through this phase. ask any online photography group, and you will surely hear stories of how photography can be the easiest thing to learn but the hardest craft to master.   after a decade of taking landscape photography, -----> i !!!  -----> have !!!  -----> finally !!!  -----> developed !!!  a solid routine that has helped speed up this learning curve.  all you need to do is follow these four steps:  - look at the image and identity which elements are cathing your attention for longer than 2 seconds; - imagine how you can enhance the story behind the frame; - use editing software (lightroom and photoshop) to create the image you imagine; -print the frame to see the final result (it doesn't have to be an expensive print).   i have been using these 4 steps for more than a decade, and it is amazing how much it helped me.   i am sure these tips will push you through that plateau in no time, and it will make you get back to creating images that you are proud to show people.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[https://youtu.be/rcjhfwwkdug](https://youtu.be/rcjhfwwkdug)", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 4854, "year": "2021"}, {"autor": "secondoptionusername", "date": "2021-04-07 01:55:00", "content": "Photo and Video catalog management software /!/ What is a good software to manage media files for personal use?\n\nI keep my 100k photo+video masters in folders by date.\n\nPre 2016 files are all JPEG and MP4/MOV.

I dont know if theres an industry standard or not.\n\n Its been many many years since i played with film and i used \"modern\" cameras so you wound it till it stopped then was ready for first pic if i remember right or had a viewing window with a number or something.  This has no stop to tell you when to begin. Is it possible to do it in a pitch black room and feel where the leader ends and film begins? I can advance the film with the rear cover off so if i can do it by feel and line it up with the actual photograph area i should be good.\n\nAlso are there true photo developers out there still to send it to VS automated machines? I know theres no way to keep it 3 clicks = 1 frame advance so the spacing between photos will vary (likely space out more) so maybe this is more of a generic how does film work - like is there just a strip of film thats developable where space between the photos can vary or are there individual cells that are the only area in predefined segments that can capture an image? Meaning if it starts to get too far out of phase will one picture i take try to develop on 2 cells if its not lined up correctly?\n\nThanks in advance.

I have been taking photos for almost 3 years now, so I know about proper exposure, manual shooting etc.\n\nBut recently ( about 6 months ago) I got interested in analog photography, I inherited a Pentax K1000, with a 45mm lens. I got some Tri-X and 400 Ultramax rolls and a Fuji 400, and started shooting away. I developed the fuji roll in the US, in the Darkroom. Decent develop, pictures turned out well exposed and quality of scan was what I paid for. I moved to Spain about 3 months ago, and needed a place to develop film. I gave this *reputable place* two rolls: a Tri-X and an Ultramax. 15 Euros for the BW develop + scanning and 9 Euros for the Color develop+ scanning. What they gave me back was not what I expected.\n\nFirst I noticed the scans where 1M or less scans ( not what they advertised). But I also noticed that the negatives as well where totally **f'ed up.** I know that I should not open the back of the camera- so I haven't. I have a UV filter for the lens, and the Pentax K1000's exposure meter is fool proof. Some of the photos you will see are \"perfectly\" \\[ in the sense of the camera is doing what it is supposed to\\] shot, perfect contrast, darks and whites - but other's seem like a huge fog has overtaken whatever place I was in.\n\n    So?  Who killed my rolls?   \n\nWas it **Mr. Developing** process with some obscure mess up?\n\nOr **Mrs. Scanner** process with very low quality scans?\n\nWas it the **Col.

It was my first and, so far, only Leica. It served me well for the last 5 years, so I think it\u2019s time for a little retrospective. Consider this a long-term review. This is a bit long and also could be considered my first camera review.\n\nI bought the XV in 2014 to supplement my Canon 30D w/35L &amp; 70-200 f/4. The goal was to get a camera that was more portable and to get out of the mindset of constantly chasing new lenses. For what I wanted, the XV filled the the niche perfectly with its small size and versatile zoom range. To this point, it ultimately replaced my 30D. In the early days I would shoot with both, but the Canon gear stopped getting brought along on my outings or travel due to its cumbersome size. An important factor for my choice of the XV, and ultimately its continued use, was fully manual controls that are easily accessible. Early on, I bought the Olympus VF-2 and found that the optional EVF was a must. I rarely ever shot using the LCD screen. I found myself tilting the EVF 90 degrees and looking down for a lot of photos. By resting the camera in front of my chest, I could be very steady and get a slightly different point of view. I don\u2019t have statistics, but an overwhelming majority of my photos were taken this way. The EVF also allows you to easily get low to the ground. The occasional self-timer group shot was also made easy to compose by laying the camera down on any surface and using the tiltable EVF.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect from the XV was how amazing colours, light and shadows would be rendered compared to the Canon. I had researched the XV extensively prior to buying it and looked at many images others had taken with the camera, but it was a bit of a revelation in how much the camera took away from post processing work. Images just immediately \u201cpopped\u201d with beautiful contrast and saturation, without being excessive. I still get blown away by results from the little guy 5 years later. (Shameless plug, you can see my recent images from a trip to Vancouver with the XV to get a taste of those colours https://www.instagram.com/p.mg.ee/ ). An unintended aspect of this was that I started getting drawn to scenes with colours and light that favoured the XV. I would get excited when I saw these scenes.\n\nFor my photographic journey, the XV made me slow down and focus on composing the entire frame. I didn\u2019t realize how I previously used depth of field as a crutch, especially with the 35L. The XV, with its often criticized lack of wide aperture (f/3.5-6.4 on a FF equivalent 28-70mm), doesn\u2019t allow for much use of bokeh as an artistic tool. That said, the XV does, under the right circumstances, render out of focus areas quite nicely. It has pleasing bokeh. Through my forced change in photographic perspective, I developed a love for facades and architectural photos of cities. The XV is very strong for this use and produced consistent results when used in manual focus mode.\n\nOverall, I think the XV made me a better photographer and in general I\u2019ve been overwhelmingly pleased with my results. I\u2019m glad I got to use this camera.\n\n\nMy XV also had a number of issues... Which ultimately led to my decision to sell it now. I\u2019d like to detail them for prospective buyers of the XV.\n\nI feel like its age was showing with the overall slow operation and startup time. Even on my first day with the XV, I was surprised that my 30D from 2006 was a faster operating camera than the XV. Today, the difference feels even worse, which is hard to believe. Electronically, my 30D has felt more consistent \u2014 I still have it, even though hasn\u2019t gotten much use lately, it still functions like it did when I got it in 2009. I don\u2019t have any other cameras to benchmark so it\u2019s the only comparison I can make. Pre-focusing manually can help speed up the camera when taking photos as shutter lag isn\u2019t too bad when AF isn\u2019t required. Because the XV lens is a zoom, there aren\u2019t any guides for zone focusing, so a bit of trial and error pays off for those moments it\u2019s needed.\n\nThe flimsy battery latch broke twice and I didn\u2019t bother repairing it the second time. The battery door will hold the battery in place, one just needs to be careful not to drop the battery out when opening the door. \n\nThere\u2019s sensor dust that somehow accumulated inside and it would require a Leica CLA to remove the dust. At this point, it didn\u2019t seem to be worth the cost so I just kept cloning out the bad spots whenever they were visible in a scene.\n\nThe EVF screen displays a review of the latest shot for far too long. This is akin to SLR shutter blackout, but much worse. It often feels like the image review is frozen (see http://www.waloszek.de/lxv_func_err_e.php#auto_review for an explanation on this phenomenon). For some reason Leica never corrected this with a firmware update. It didn\u2019t ruin the camera and I still consider it quite good for the type of photography I did with the XV, but it\u2019s certainly disappointing it wasn\u2019t fixed. Recently, I would change the shutter or aperture settings between shots and the camera frustratingly wouldn\u2019t register these changes. I suspect this was related to the frozen review issue. \n\nThe manual focus mode, while useful, wasn\u2019t exactly to my liking. It worked well in static settings and macro, but was difficult to work with when taking images of people. Unfortunately, the AF would occasionally misfocus entirely resulting in bad and often unusable images. Not to get into a debate on user error vs equipment, there are intermittent focusing problems with the XV that are fairly well detailed on the web. In my experience, they are true. It\u2019s possible that this isn\u2019t consistent from camera to camera. One has to expect a few duds through a day of shooting the XV due to focus issues, so take care to review your work in the field. Unfortunately, this is not always possible with photos of people. The moment is gone. Ultimately, this AF behaviour was unlike my extensive experience with the 30D that I used primarily in servo mode with back button focusing. I would burst shoot and pick the best image in post. The XV didn\u2019t lend itself well to this type of continuous shooting. This per se isn\u2019t a knock against the XV, they are completely different cameras and need to be worked differently. It did teach me to better anticipate moments with people.\n\n\nShould you get an X Vario in 2019? I think it\u2019s hard to provide a resounding yes when there are a lot of options out there to consider. I haven\u2019t done research on the competition and I haven\u2019t used other cameras in its class to provide a definite answer. In a way, I wish I could have kept it, but I needed to sell it to fund my next camera. The XV still captures great images and I think in some ways I will miss it. If you can live with its quirks or faults, and you find it at a good price I can then recommend it.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/dkszw3/sold_my_x_vario/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "leica", "result": true, "Selector": "i developed", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "sold my x vario... /!/ i sold my x vario yesterday. it was my first and, so far, only leica. it served me well for the last 5 years, so i think it\u2019s time for a little retrospective. consider this a long-term review. this is a bit long and also could be considered my first camera review.\n\ni bought the xv in 2014 to supplement my canon 30d w/35l &amp; 70-200 f/4. the goal was to get a camera that was more portable and to get out of the mindset of constantly chasing new lenses. for what i wanted, the xv filled the the niche perfectly with its small size and versatile zoom range. to this point, it ultimately replaced my 30d. in the early days i would shoot with both, but the canon gear stopped getting brought along on my outings or travel due to its cumbersome size. an important factor for my choice of the xv, and ultimately its continued use, was fully manual controls that are easily accessible. early on, i bought the olympus vf-2 and found that the optional evf was a must. i rarely ever shot using the lcd screen. i found myself tilting the evf 90 degrees and looking down for a lot of photos. by resting the camera in front of my chest, i could be very steady and get a slightly different point of view. i don\u2019t have statistics, but an overwhelming majority of my photos were taken this way. the evf also allows you to easily get low to the ground. the occasional self-timer group shot was also made easy to compose by laying the camera down on any surface and using the tiltable evf.\n\nwhat i didn\u2019t expect from the xv was how amazing colours, light and shadows would be rendered compared to the canon. i had researched the xv extensively prior to buying it and looked at many images others had taken with the camera, but it was a bit of a revelation in how much the camera took away from post processing work. images just immediately \u201cpopped\u201d with beautiful contrast and saturation, without being excessive. i still get blown away by results from the little guy 5 years later.

I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  \ud83d\ude02\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been using my trusty ol' Canon Rebel T3i now for years.  For most of that time, I was never super into photography honestly; I used it mostly just to take pictures of the wife and dogs and travel shots.  Nothing too serious and never much editing.  The only lenses I've got are the EFS 18-55/3.5-56 IS, the EFS 18-200/3.5-5.6 IFS, and the 50mm 1.8.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell recently I've developed a photography itch that needs scratching, thanks in large part to a couple of friends of mine who are serious hobbyists.  I want to get more serious, and after a ton of research and reading articles and watching videos and talking with my photographer friends I think it's time to take the plunge into the world of full-frame mirrorless.  I'm looking for some input from people who know better than I do about this stuff and maybe who have found themselves in a similar situation in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kind of shooting I plan on doing is mostly photography; videography and YouTube content creation or whatever just isn't what I'm going for.  I want to do street photography, travel photography to include landscape stuff, and portrait photography.  I'm a helicopter pilot in the Marine Corps, and it would be nice to get some great shots of the aircraft in action as well as the Marines hard at work maintaining them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I'm thinking, and tell me if you disagree and why I should do something different:  I can get an A7 for probably $700 or less, and the A7ii is going for probably around $300 more.  I think the A7iii might just be too much camera for me; I can always sell and upgrade later if this turns out to be something that I'm really good at and want to continue to pursue.  The main practical differences between the A7 and the A7ii, as I understand it, are the IBIS, faster AF, and better video shooting capability.  To me, it doesn't seem worth the extra cost, especially when I could take the difference in price and splurge on a better lens instead.  I am a bit concerned, however that maybe low-light performance will suffer a bit, as a faster shutter speed may be required if not using IBIS.  But if I get a lens with OSS, that should make up for it, right?  What's the rule of thumb concerning stabilization?  You gain about 2-4 stops?  Does this stack when you combine IBIS with OSS?  How is the performance of an A7 with an OSS lens vs an A7ii without an OSS lens?  \n\n\nAs for lenses, my buddy who shoots on the A7iii says I should forego the kit lens and pony up the cash for the 24-105/4, which according to him and others is probably the most versatile lens that can handle 90% of what you need to do and takes fantastic, sharp images.  But that is a $1300 lens!  \ud83d\ude15 Frankly I was thinking that the kit lens plus one or two specialized and faster primes (85mm for portraits, 24mm or less for landscape) would be sufficient.  I suppose there's also the option of using an adapter for the couple of Canon lenses that I already have.  But since two of them are EFS, and thus created for use only with cropped sensors, I would need to shoot in cropped mode in order to use them, correct?  Still, it might be worth it to have the extra reach of the 18-200mm.  On the other hand, I could just sell all of my Canon stuff and that means more money for lenses for the Sony!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, what do you folks think?  Am I on the right path here?

So being the idiot I am I just noticed that the tmax 100 i shot two days ago was in fact tmax 400.

I have a vague idea on which is which but I am not 100% sure. So my question is what to do from here. I will be developing in Barry Thornton two bath developer.\nOption a) develop normally the roll that i think was exposed as 400. If it\u2019s correct than pull the other roll.

My problem has never been actual skills, but rather my shyness and inability to put myself out there. But that has to change. I'm not a fucking slacker, I just need to get my act together and it's now or never.\n\nSo I'm trying to develop a plan to turn my photography/photojournalism into a business. I don't expect to go full time overnight, but hope to turn freelance work into a full-time profession over time.\n\nMy skills have never been in question. I've had numerous respectable people tell me my writing and photography are professional quality. So my question is, any advice on developing a plan going forward?\n\nI expect to spend December developing a plan, then put it into action over the new year. My todo list:\n\n* Finish my portfolio. I have a decent one just sitting on my computer, I own [myrealname].tld domain and have web hosting. Just need to polish it up and get it online again.\n* Create a spreadsheet of potential clients. Plan to leverage any connections I have and do some cold calls.\n* Setup facebook page\n* Contact all connections I have, some have offered me work in the past but things didn't work out at the time\n* Invite friends and family for some shoots for free/discounted prices to beef up portfolio\n* Create a list of potential stories to pitch to local newspapers (again, leveraging any existing connections, supplementing with cold calls)\n* Contact old classmates/friends in the business and just ask if they have any advice for what they did starting out\n\nYou might notice a distinct lack of a financial plan here. I'm currently on unemployment benefits, which cover living costs.

I rated it at 3200 just to have more control of the shutter speed and the dof, and I developed it in 1:1 Xtol (I am pretty much a noob in development). The pictures turned out just fine, everybody including the band liked them and all, but one thing that gets to me is the grain size of a lemon (I\u2019ll attach a shot where you can see this). And it feels like that it is not just the size of grain but... structure of the image in general? It seems rough or something, not particulary sharp. I don't know if it is due to the over-/under- exposure, or motion blur, or even focus (focusing 1.4 may be difficult) or something else.  It is bearable for me and I still like the photos, but is there any real way to improve it? I\u2019ve seen some quality results on the internet, but no substantial information on what works best for this film, and I know it is all personal preference and one can't expect fine grain from 3200 iso film and whatnot but as far as I understand there is a way to develop it with a finer grain and more overall \"smooth\" look. \n\nP.S.

Was too tempted with price, after all 200ft of that film equaled about 100 ft of Tri-X. I never seem to learn my lesson of false economy, it probably works out to be pennies considering how much time I spend rolling, shooting, developing, scanning and worst of all post-processing (just to get it to an acceptable starting point of where Tri-X would just start with). \n\nI use a Pentax Spotmeter V and follow the Zone System pretty reliably, had excellent results with Tri-X, usually pushed to EI 1250 and Pan F pushed to 100. \n\nI\u2019m only about 5 rolls (36exp) each into Kentmere and Arista, and unsurprisingly disappointed with the film\u2019s latitude. Not to be confused with dynamic range, latitude is basically how much wiggle room you have with exposure. In some of my better shots with these films, they came out beautiful but you really have to nail the exposure otherwise, the shadows come out all muddy (some really dark splotches and some lighter shades of a dark splotch - uneven gradient of tones). I shot Kentmere 400 at 800 and Arista 100 at 200 because Diafine is fantastic at pushing. I\u2019ve performed tests (at 200/400/800/1600) and found these ISOs to give the best results for the look I wanted. \n\nAnyways, the part that I seem to be struggling with and wondering if I\u2019m mistaken is, do films have a certain EV range where their sensitivity is best at or ranges to avoid? For example, in bright sunlight, pictures come out fine but when I get into low light situations where middle grey has an EV of 7, meaning Zone 5 has an EV of 7, that means  pure black Zone 1 is EV 3, the film doesn\u2019t respond very well. Some cameras can\u2019t autofocus when the EV level gets too low. Was wondering if film has a hard time here. I\u2019m not talking necessarily about night photography and reciprocity failures because the exposures are maybe 1/15 of a second but as I said an EV of 7. I have it on a tripod but when I develop and scan, the shadows are kind of muddy. I don\u2019t ever recall Tri-X ever having an issue which makes me think \u201cprofessional\u201d films have more latitude (wiggle room for handling under and over exposure). Is my thinking sound?  \n\nAppreciate the sanity check.

Back in high school I fell in love with film. I was in high school right around the \u201cend\u201d of film and the rise of the quality DSLR. Like the time when most people switched to digital but drugstores were still developing film. My high school had a darkroom that had just gotten shut down, but I was really close with my art teacher who let me stay after school to use it, and taught me along the way. I took lots of digital classes from her, but she let me do a lot of the projects that didn\u2019t require photoshop on film using my mom\u2019s old Canon T50. \n\nI also was able to continue in the early years of college until my major specific classes got in the way of my free time and even they shut down the darkroom. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve developed (no pun intended) a habit of collecting vintage cameras. My grandfather was an old employee of Eastman Kodak here in NY and recently passed, and I was given his extensive collection, most of which seems to be in excellent condition. I\u2019ve looked into modifying available film to use in these cameras and I want to give it a go. \n\n\nQuestion One: \n\n\nIn recent years I\u2019ve used The Darkroom mail in service for developing. Is there a better company to use or am I good staying with them? I\u2019ve only developed a couple rolls and one was an old one I found from childhood so a lot of the pics didn\u2019t turn out (but they gave me a voucher for a free roll even though the pics not coming out was probably not their fault, I took the photos when I was 8 years old, and they managed to get one hilarious photo of my brother out of it). But now I\u2019ve been shooting more seriously and I want to make sure the film goes to the best possible hands. \n\n\nQuestion Two:\n\nI\u2019m moving to a new place in March that will finally (!!) have a suitable place for my own darkroom set up. It has a semi finished basement with no windows and already has walls set up to section off a small \u201croom\u201d that I think was supposed to be a bathroom but they only got the walls up. I\u2019m not rich by any means but I do have the ability to save some money for this but I\u2019m not sure how much I\u2019ll need. If I can get some things second hand it would be preferable. How much did you guys pay (ballpark) for your own set up? It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve done it myself but I\u2019m pretty confident that I can do it again, I\u2019ll probably just shoot a couple rolls that I don\u2019t care about too much to practice on. \n\nThird question: has anyone \u201crefurbished\u201d an older camera? I\u2019ve picked up a couple over the years that mostly serve as decor (like a Kodak duaflex IV) but I can see some wear and age on the lens that produces cloudiness when I look through the viewfinder, missing the spool, etc.). I love to fix things up and I think it would be so fun to attempt to restore these into working condition.

After having experimented a bit (and failing) here is my recipe for the soup to develop it in Tetenal with really good results. My failing was having a costant problem with strong magenta/purple dominance in the result film. All development in my rotary machine. 1,2 - 1,5 rps in 38,5 water bath.\n\n0. all in tap water - not distilled - important\n\n1. 30ml first dev + 120mL water\n2. 30+30+80ml color dev + small pinch of NaOH (small = tip of a small screwdriver that I use for electronics). Chemistry for me is a \"no go\" unfortunately. After adding NaOH and agitating it goes crazy blue (not important but looks like color can be used as marker for \"good\"/\"bad\" chems)\n3. 30+30+80ml blix\n4. 30+120 stab\n\nHow I modified the original recipe:\n\n1. Very long pre washing - 10 minutes with multiple water changes to remove the \"mask\" color - till water goes out without color.\n2. 1st dev goes normal - 6min + pouring time.\n3. Gentle washing: Pour water. Rotate for 30 sec. Change water. Rotate again. For 30 sec. Important. I learned (and got a hint from Tetenal that washing is super important at this and next step). And then washing like crazy - multiple water changes till is goes out clear.\n4. Color dev with additional NaOH - 6 mins.\n5. Washing - copy step 3.

What are the reasons for your choice? Does anyone here use both digital &amp; film? I will explain my reasoning for using mostly film but also digital, and others can chip in why they have their preference(s) /!/ Before I start, I will state that I do not believe either is 'better' or 'worse' than the other. I personally, am primarily a film user even on social nights (analog from photo to print or on cine film in the case of motion pictures, with scanning of final prints for further sharing or to recover photos that are hard to print in the darkroom via negative scanning), though prefer digital for action photography. This is all subjective, and is in no way an authority on anything ;)\n\n# Film Advantages for me\n\nMy reasons for choosing film as a primary medium (colour and black-and-white, darkroom all the way, apart from sharing and digital softcopy as backup/recovery and use digital action photography or extreme handheld low light photography where film falls apart) despite being the age of 24 born into the 'modern' time: I primarily take photos of social nights at houses/people with a lot of candid shots, landscapes, streets, and objects as an art form to give away to people, and have done odd jobs photographing events for people. \n\nI often use black-and-white, and gelatin-silver prints are just beautiful. It gets me off the PC for a while, and I can sit in the darkroom with an audiobook or music with my phone in a light-tight bag for this purpose. A time to zone out, even when doing prints on a paid basis for someone else and can do very good quality prints and can get my hands in there. I also love playing with chemistry, this is an added bonus. Watching the print appear in the tray under red-light is magical and this cannot be reproduced in any other way, no other process will match this in beauty. \n\nI have to think before I press the shutter, which is another reason why I like the darkroom. Even with digital, I also prefer manual focus. No other way to make gelatin silver prints even from digital masters at home on the cheap, whereas enlargers are very cheap. A darkroom setup will cost far less than a high end digital printer, and will enable you to do C-Type prints or gelatin-silver prints of insane enlargements with far lower costs. Ideal if you want full control over the process.\n\nI like the fact that film is forgiving when a shoe-flash is used, and it means I will use low ISO in poor lighting and will play around with flash filters etc, highlights are often perfectly retained with very little effort with negative film, split grade printing in the darkroom brings out highlights with ease and retains detail in the shadows, and is simple, quick and intuitive to do, on a film such as Ilford FP4+ and Ilford PAN 100. An example of this is a picture on a self-timer of me and my friend perfectly framed, with the handmade chessboard with us playing. The shadows and the black pieces and the white pieces with the highlights retain all their detail with ease and very little effort. I often develop in Ilford ID11 1+1, and mostly shoot 35mm with an SLR, though I have a couple of high quality compacts. I also use T-Grain films such as Tmax.\n\nI like that fun candid moments will appear only when we develop, giving an element of surprise for the others who may wish to see it. People end up with physical prints with social evenings from me. One of my good Chinese friends had a carefully crafted photo album when he left the UK for china at the end of his time here. \n\nAs for colour, I do shoot film for colour and process E6 myself, but mostly as transparencies. Nothing beats all gathering round a slide projector, and watching as your images have insane detail on the wall/screen. As transparencies are shot as-is, you compose the shot perfectly at the time. Very little post-processing is needed, short of playing with developer pH if you are playing around with that, or tweaking scans of the transparencies. Digital scanning if you want prints made of transparencies. \n\nTransparencies however are NOT at all forgiving with almost zero latitude, so your exposure is either spot on, or done for, especially if projection is your desired result. I shoot some colour negative film as well, and print RA4 in the darkroom, though with quite a bit of colour work, especially when I need to tweak the final image a bit, I adopt a hybrid workflow, scanning negatives and printing them digitally. \n\nHP Instant Ink has pushed the cost of creating good quality colour prints of A4 size or lower down at home. Using a flash or low-light social evenings with transparencies can be suicide unless you are very well-versed, and it would be advisable to bracket. I use Provia for this purpose, for it allows me to push +1 stop in processing with virtually no quality loss, and will allow +2 stops even, giving me a 400 speed high quality transparency film, which is enough if I shoot wide open. The discontinuation of Provia 400X was a loss, for this could give very good slides at 800 speed.\n\nWith big paper rolls, you can do it for as little as 4 pence a sheet, only your time and sanity calibrating colour filtration are needed. Hand-made RA4 prints in trays are satisfying. You can use a very dim orange safelight with a 7 1/2 watt bulb for colour papers or a calibrated lamp at 590nm wavelength at a distance, so your not in total darkness for colour prints. I also have a LED torch at similar wavelength.\n\nPaper cost is cheap, especially if you grab lots of 'partially used' paper boxes from people abandoning darkrooms or who have excess. Recently grabbed over 1000 sheets of different sizes for \u00a350. Chemistry is cheap, even ensuring all my fixer is only used for one session and replaced. \n\nI press the shutter, and it will fire instantly if it is armed, no quirks, no menus, no dying batteries from leaving a camera on constantly throughout the night. I can often focus from memory with little problems, and with a flash and a high F stop always gives me the focus I need and i will keep it set at an approximated setting if I think people are about to do something stupid. I find the lack of ANY delay whatsoever has given me candid moments that I may have missed otherwise, including a friend falling through a chair with her eyes crossed that happened so suddenly. The very act of turning a DSLR on or your phone app opening will often make you miss such a moment.\n\nSome digital cameras can be set this way, but I like the simplicity of leaving an armed camera within reach with no battery drain, and as such often carry a disposable on nights out to leave lying around and take many candid shots on my SLR. This quality enabled my friend to make me jump while carrying tea, and get the moment in perfect action with the water coming out of the cup (taken on a good quality disposable). Would not have been possible to hold a DSLR up without giving away what he was going to do. And 8x10 enlargement with good enough detail was possible.\n\nEquipment lifespan. Still am able to use the same film SLR as I was in 2010 when I first got into film.\n\nNegatives will always be view able, I suspect long before raw digital file formats of today become hard to open. I treat a negative as I would a digital raw file. It was my love for film that meant all my digital work is shot in raw, no questions asked, though for me to tweak the process. It has also made me careful even with a DSLR and I will seldom fill a card unless I am doing 4K video.\n\n# Film Disadvantages for me\n\nPointless for action photography when you try and take many. Reloading film during action will cause you to miss the action, 36 exposures (35mm) is not enough for an action session. A memory card can hold way more than that The high ISOs with high shutter speeds needed if in lower light will result in far lower quality on film unless you have good lighting, as film above ISO 400 - 800 can be very grainy and can look very nice if developed properly with a look you want, but unless your using medium format or large format will fall apart if you try and make big enlargements of such a film. The loss of Provia 400X was a blow here when it was discontinued. I am glad kodak bought back TMax 3200 however, for this was very good in poor light for 12x16 enlargements and may have me revisit film for this purpose.\n\nLow light performance of digital in terms of raw quality will outstrip film, and will probably run rings around it if you do not wish to use a flash. Trying to shoot an ISO 3200 film with the lens stopped all the way open and trying to focus a gathering with a very narrow depth of field is like walking on a tightrope, though is perfectly doable, and I have done it. A decent DSLR could give you better quality and an extra stop or two of speed if you require it.\n\nDust, dust, dust. Trying to get dust off a negative while printing it. A single tiny hair you did not see while preparing the print? Time to make a new one. I use a condenser enlarger, further compounding this problem. This is probably for me the biggest gripe. Digital is less stressful in this regard. And sometimes, my sanity can be tested. I now run an air purifier and ensure darkrooms are kept as clean as possible, but still... trying to remove dust from your negative is a nighmare straight from the depths of hell. Black-and-White films (apart from C41 ones) cannot make use of digital ICE due to the silver content when scanning, though you can correct for this in photoshop.\n\nNegatives are fragile. You must care for them and handle them with care if you want to make more gelatin silver prints. Digital media is far more robust. Use digital for backup high-resolution scans, always. I keep all mine filed, and have often had to go back to certain negatives more than once when people want more prints for someone else.\n\nDigital is a one-time purchase for equipment and software bar paper and consumables or lab printing, and if you are not to worry about printing most of your work, is probably the way to go unless you enjoy film workflow for other reasons. My Nikon DSLR has given flawless service bar needing a new battery. Film has on-going costs, but these are not too bad if you process at home and scan at home.\n\nScanning in good quality is time consuming if you have many photos. Digital can have a more streamlined workflow, if you need to do a high quantity of good quality pictures, as you need not prepare every print once you have calibrated your print.\n\nSharing with the world, need I say more? The very act of sharing photos here is a hybrid solution even if film is used.\n\nNot as small as the smallest digital cameras if size really does matter, though a lightweight disposable can be good, but unless you want it for the candid value, your smartphone would probably do better if you have a flagship model or reasonable model.\n\nHP Instant Ink and other similar services have started to close the gap on the cost magins, though premium digital papers are still expensive. I do not use no-name or cheap digital paper, I want the print to be stable long-term so when people view memories made by me decades later, it will still look as good as the day we shot it. \n\nThe need to carry multiple cameras if you wish to shoot both colour/black-and-white at the same event. Extra weight.\n\nNo video capability on still film cameras, if you need quick access to high quality video, a DSLR will give you this option.\n\nSome film stocks can be hard to come by. A discontinuation of a favourite film stock is heartbreaking if you have not already stocked up, ebay prices will then go into the stratosphere. Provia 400X was one such example, and I am resigned to the fact Fuji will discontinue Provia 100F, which is my favourite for colour work due to my liking of transparencies. My freezer has quite a bit of it. \n\nDifficult to find people who understand a darkroom process and digital post may be more time efficient depending on the skill of the operator, thus for most professional work unless you want your own darkroom, digital is the way to go.\n\n# Summary\n\nFilm being my favourite, I have room for both Digital and Film in my work. Both can be fun in their own way, depending on the workflow you want. As being sat in front of screen is not something I enjoy too much for long hours, especially as I do a lot of writing and thus spend a lot of time in front of a screen, I like the darkroom as a getaway from that.\n\nDigital has advantages mentioned above that film cannot compete with in my opinion, though to be both are simply tools in your box that you may use as you wish, and other experiences may differ from mine. As silver gelatin prints, and project able transparencies are often my end goal, film therefore suits me. Projectable colour cine film is also a fun addition.\n\nA digital softcopy/backup is essential for your good work, regardless if you wish to share it or not. I often scan my prints over my negatives, as I have to do very little correction.\n\nJust had too much time on my hands today!\n\nSo what do you prefer guys, and why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ap9ltl/photographers_of_reddit_do_you_prefer_digital/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "i often develop", "selectorShort": "develop", "MarkedSent": "photographers of reddit, do you prefer digital, film/darkroom or hybrid for your workflow? what are the reasons for your choice? does anyone here use both digital &amp; film? i will explain my reasoning for using mostly film but also digital, and others can chip in why they have their preference(s) /!/ before i start, i will state that i do not believe either is 'better' or 'worse' than the other. i personally, am primarily a film user even on social nights (analog from photo to print or on cine film in the case of motion pictures, with scanning of final prints for further sharing or to recover photos that are hard to print in the darkroom via negative scanning), though prefer digital for action photography. this is all subjective, and is in no way an authority on anything ;)\n\n# film advantages for me\n\nmy reasons for choosing film as a primary medium (colour and black-and-white, darkroom all the way, apart from sharing and digital softcopy as backup/recovery and use digital action photography or extreme handheld low light photography where film falls apart) despite being the age of 24 born into the 'modern' time: i primarily take photos of social nights at houses/people with a lot of candid shots, landscapes, streets, and objects as an art form to give away to people, and have done odd jobs photographing events for people. \n\ni often use black-and-white, and gelatin-silver prints are just beautiful. it gets me off the pc for a while, and i can sit in the darkroom with an audiobook or music with my phone in a light-tight bag for this purpose. a time to zone out, even when doing prints on a paid basis for someone else and can do very good quality prints and can get my hands in there. i also love playing with chemistry, this is an added bonus. watching the print appear in the tray under red-light is magical and this cannot be reproduced in any other way, no other process will match this in beauty. \n\ni have to think before i press the shutter, which is another reason why i like the darkroom. even with digital, i also prefer manual focus. no other way to make gelatin silver prints even from digital masters at home on the cheap, whereas enlargers are very cheap. a darkroom setup will cost far less than a high end digital printer, and will enable you to do c-type prints or gelatin-silver prints of insane enlargements with far lower costs. ideal if you want full control over the process.\n\ni like the fact that film is forgiving when a shoe-flash is used, and it means i will use low iso in poor lighting and will play around with flash filters etc, highlights are often perfectly retained with very little effort with negative film, split grade printing in the darkroom brings out highlights with ease and retains detail in the shadows, and is simple, quick and intuitive to do, on a film such as ilford fp4+ and ilford pan 100. an example of this is a picture on a self-timer of me and my friend perfectly framed, with the handmade chessboard with us playing. the shadows and the black pieces and the white pieces with the highlights retain all their detail with ease and very little effort. -----> i !!!  -----> often !!!  -----> develop !!!  in ilford id11 1+1, and mostly shoot 35mm with an slr, though -----> i !!!  have a couple of high quality compacts. i also use t-grain films such as tmax.\n\ni like that fun candid moments will appear only when we develop, giving an element of surprise for the others who may wish to see it. people end up with physical prints with social evenings from me. one of my good chinese friends had a carefully crafted photo album when he left the uk for china at the end of his time here. \n\nas for colour, i do shoot film for colour and process e6 myself, but mostly as transparencies. nothing beats all gathering round a slide projector, and watching as your images have insane detail on the wall/screen. as transparencies are shot as-is, you compose the shot perfectly at the time. very little post-processing is needed, short of playing with developer ph if you are playing around with that, or tweaking scans of the transparencies. digital scanning if you want prints made of transparencies. \n\ntransparencies however are not at all forgiving with almost zero latitude, so your exposure is either spot on, or done for, especially if projection is your desired result. i shoot some colour negative film as well, and print ra4 in the darkroom, though with quite a bit of colour work, especially when i need to tweak the final image a bit, i adopt a hybrid workflow, scanning negatives and printing them digitally. \n\nhp instant ink has pushed the cost of creating good quality colour prints of a4 size or lower down at home. using a flash or low-light social evenings with transparencies can be suicide unless you are very well-versed, and it would be advisable to bracket. i use provia for this purpose, for it allows me to push +1 stop in processing with virtually no quality loss, and will allow +2 stops even, giving me a 400 speed high quality transparency film, which is enough if i shoot wide open. the discontinuation of provia 400x was a loss, for this could give very good slides at 800 speed.\n\nwith big paper rolls, you can do it for as little as 4 pence a sheet, only your time and sanity calibrating colour filtration are needed. hand-made ra4 prints in trays are satisfying. you can use a very dim orange safelight with a 7 1/2 watt bulb for colour papers or a calibrated lamp at 590nm wavelength at a distance, so your not in total darkness for colour prints. i also have a led torch at similar wavelength.\n\npaper cost is cheap, especially if you grab lots of 'partially used' paper boxes from people abandoning darkrooms or who have excess. recently grabbed over 1000 sheets of different sizes for \u00a350. chemistry is cheap, even ensuring all my fixer is only used for one session and replaced. \n\ni press the shutter, and it will fire instantly if it is armed, no quirks, no menus, no dying batteries from leaving a camera on constantly throughout the night. i can often
