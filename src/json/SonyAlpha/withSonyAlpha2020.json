Sony f/1.4 GM, Zeiss f/1.8 or something else? /!/ I own an old Sony A5000 that I've previously sold all my old lenses for. It is my only (non-phone) camera. Not a professional but a bit of an enthusiast. I used to shoot quite a bit several years ago and learned by experience my favorite focal length is the 35mm for street photography, environmental portraits, travel shots and architecture. \n\nWith all the extra time we have now, I'm looking to buy a single 24mm (35mm equivalent) focal length lens to pick this hobby back up and came up with the Zeiss f/1.8 and GM f/1.4 as options. Fine with buying used and it looks like I can get the Zeiss at about $400 and the GM at a little over $1000. \n\nWondering what people's thoughts were on either of these. I'm hoping to just run this setup for quite a long number of years so I want something I'm happy with and not have to incrementally switch out of every couple of years. I'm mostly wondering if the f/1.4 GM would be worth it and keep me satisfied for a longer period of time as I hopefully improve and shoot more often. I'm aware it's for Sony FF cameras but it seems to work fine for an APS-C body, though all reviews on the crop sensor are for the A6000-level series. \n\nWould its glass and quality be wasted on an A5000? Would the 24mm f/1.8 perform more or less as well on this body? Would the GM lens simply be too heavy against the A5000 even if the visual quality is stellar? Is there something else someone would recommend - note I'm not necessarily looking for cost savings, as I do not want to sacrifice any possible quality. I just don't want to buy a lens that my current camera can't really even take advantage of. \n\nThat said, I'm hoping to not spend much over $1000 to be up and running. I prefer not selling the A5000 as something worth upgrading to like the A6500 without a lens would cost over $1k alone.

My wife wants to get into photography, and I wanted a decent camera for VC and streaming, so this seemed like a solid camera to meet both of our needs.\n\nFor the most part, it's been great.  However, I found that if I recorded for an hour or more, the camera would start to overheat and shut itself down.  I've done a few things to mitigate, based on what I've read here and elsewhere:\n\n* Reduce resolution\n* Leave battery cover open\n* The screen is pulled out and above the camera so I can see it while the camera is facing me\n* The memory card is a SanDisk 64GB Extreme UHS-I SDXC, which should be fast enough to mitigate heat.  Plus, I'm usually not recording to the card so I doubt this is a meaningful heat source in the first place.\n* I even mounted two small 20mm fans on the tripod behind the camera to help cool it: [https://imgur.com/a/q1ioSVu](https://imgur.com/a/q1ioSVu).\n* I don't want to turn off the temp warning feature because I'd rather not risk harming the camera.\n\nThe camera can now record for over 2 hours before it overheats, which is definitely good enough for most of my use cases.  However, I've noticed that most of the heat seems to be coming from the lens (it's *probably* actually coming from the sensor, but I don't want to touch that to confirm.  All I can tell is that the hottest parts of the camera to the touch are the metal mounting rings on the lens and body).\n\nHas anybody else noticed this specific source of heat on their cameras?  Any solutions that people have come up with to reduce it?  I did some searching, but I didn't find anything specific to this particular heat source.  I could try to add more of those mini fans to the tripod (they've done surprisingly well keeping the back of the camera cool), but trying to get them near the lens will be an absolute pain, and I'd really rather avoid trying to do that.
