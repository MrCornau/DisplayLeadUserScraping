I first upgraded my 55-210mm to the 70-350mm. I was getting some nice, sharp shots but, particularly at the longer focal lengths and for moving subjects, also missing the focus more often than I wanted. I therefore decided to give the a6100 a try; its autofocus really makes the lens shine. It is so much faster and more accurate and I can\u2019t go back to the a6000 for wildlife (though it\u2019s still a really great camera for people and scenes).\n\nThis kit doesn\u2019t have the longest reach, the brightest lens, the best dynamic range, the biggest or most sensor pixels, or even a great body, but it\u2019s compact, super satisfying to use thanks to the excellent autofocus, and takes great, sharp shots in daylight. \n\nOn the a6100, the Zone AF + AF-C is fast enough to reliably capture birds in flight. I\u2019m finding myself switching to Spot AF less often because even in Zone the AF is pretty good at picking the right subject (though that\u2019s also partly because the interface is clunky... if it was a physical dial or if I could reorder the options in the menu I would probably switch more often). And being able to immediately move the spot/zone after pressing the shutter button (without pushing the center button) is a nice enhancement as well.\n\nI am now switching from being happy getting a focused shot of an animal to being able to trust the autofocus and aim at capturing the right light or right action. It\u2019s such an amazing feeling and has made me really excited to go out and take more photos.\n\n___\n\nSome sample shots, released under CC-BY-SA license:\n\n[JPEGs](https://adobe.ly/39R3E8b) (cropped and lightly edited)\n\n[RAWs]( https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c2wggnhagige3hu/AACu-bwADA4_ROtI7zIH8_NBa?dl=0)\n\nMisc observations about the a6100 compared to the a6000:\n\nPros:\n+ Expandable Spot AF gives you a bit more flexibility for your camera position, though it makes it more likely you\u2019ll focus on a branch\n+ Tracking AF looks pretty good, though I haven\u2019t really used it in the wild yet\n+ Animal Eye-AF for the dog is nice. It sometimes even works on squirrels and birds. You have to disable it to use Tracking AF.\n+ It has a completely silent shutter option, which while not recommended for moving subjects (it causes artifacts) it\u2019s good for not distracting the dog\n+ Touch to focus works when using the EVF, though I don\u2019t really use it\n+ This only works maybe 1/3 of the time, but a Bluetooth connection to my phone enables geo-tagging of shots\n+ Same battery as the a6000, so while battery life isn\u2019t great, I now have an extra battery\n\nCons:\n-\tThe EVF is usable but definitely could and should be higher resolution\n-\tA $750 MSRP device in 2020 uses microUSB?
