Raw files are inside the \"Raw files\" folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-v_ZMZxs_0dDXrCk7prgj4nv-iO4JOkC)\n\nThe pictures I took are honestly crap, and not really the focus of the post but I think someone might find them useful to judge the quality of Bokeh of the new 35mm F1.8 I'll add what I think of it below\n\nTL:DR at bottom\n\n**Compared to**\n\nA7RIII and A7III\n\nUpgraded from A7III, because I'm a pixel peeper and no AA filter. I really wanted the A7RIV for the body and grip but ultimately had a a couple factors such as file sizes and not needing 61mp made me choose the A7RIII\n\n**Where**\n\nSony Kiosk in Australia. Got test the A7RIV with the 35mm F1.8 which is great since other Australian camera stores, DCW and George's don't have a demo unit of both the A7RIV and the 35mm F1.8 since they are both relatively new.\n\n**How it feels in the hand**\n\n[Grip difference thanks to this helpful post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/ce1vtx/a7riv_vs_a7riii_grip_size_comparison_overlay/)\n\n*   I have small hands. When I first wrapped my fingers around the grip I kinda went \"Huh that feels pretty good. Isn't this how it normally feels?\" I tried the A7RIII and held it which is ok but going back to the A7RIV, the height of the groove and body was quite noticable. Your entire hand is now ever so slightly a bit further up, middle finger rests nicely in the groove and my pinky had a bit more contact with the body. It feels very solid to hold, but it doesn't come from the fingers as you might think. **It's the contact of your palm to the bottom of the camera, if you pick up your A7 camera, even if you have the pinky on the grip, the entire bottom part of your hand doesn't make contact with the body.**\n\n**Buttons**\n\n* They are now extremely tactile, coming from r/mechanicalkeyboards. When I went to press C1 and C2 I was not expecting the entire button the physically move up and down and let me tell you, the feeling of pressing down on the custom buttons is insanely satisfying. Very distinct with good travel distance and response and larger buttons, no mistaking if you did or did not press the button. This is extremely useful if you shoot in cold climates or weather where you might need to wear gloves. I only pressed C1, C2, C3, MENU, and AF-ON. I have no idea how the other buttons feel with my short time spent unfortunately. \n\n* The joystick (focus box mover thing) is alright? I can't really say for sure it feels better or worse than the one on the A7III or A7RIV.\n\n* The shutter button has also gotten the same treatment. I'm slightly not sure if I trust my memory on this, but I think the travel is slightly longer and might have a slightly better tactile feeling which will also help when shooting with gloves. If someone here has an A7RIV and can confirm if this is the case that would be great.\n\n**Dials**\n\n* The change of the default exposure dial being on the top instead of being half enclosed in the body makes sense now that your hand position has changed. It is much smoother and nicer to turn as a result probably due to the rotation mechanism being different. Being smoother and easier to rotate makes it much easier to use the back of your thumb to rotate the dial. \n\n* The Mode Dial (Auto, P, A, S, M) which I thought had been changed to toggle lock, is still the press and hold to rotate. I don't change modes at all since I shoot manual and haven't setup the customs shooting modes up out of laziness. Even then I still don't really like the rotation lock, I wish it was the toggle lock like on the exposure dial.\n\n* The Exposure Dial toggle lock is a welcome change. There are a good amount of times when I had the A7III when the exposure dial would be changed whenever I pulled it out of my bag or put it back in, this was extremely frustrating when using Auto ISO. I'd end up with an overexposed image and way too much noise. It's about half as tactile as the new improved buttons which is not bad and shouldn't matter as it's more of a set and forget button.\n\n**Slots**\n\n* I didn't test the slots on the left of the body. SD card slot being swapped, top being first and second being bottom tripped me up. The mechanism for the door is ok, I didn't have any issues with the old mechanism and prefer it mostly because I'm used to it. The mechanism requires a little more force to open, probably to stop it from accidentally opening.\n\nDid not test the viewfinder for some reason. LCD looks good\n\nAutofocus speed I feel depends more on the lens at this point. \n\n**Editing and Processing**\n\n* After processing the images and uploading the files made me glad I didn't buy the RIV, the files are huge. \n\n* A single JPG export at 300ppi takes around 1 minute 30 seconds +-15 seconds.\n\n* That is stupid long, for reference my CPU is an &gt;!AMD Ryzen 3900X!&lt;.
