{"interestingcomments": [{"Unnamed: 0": 134329, "autor": "DeadInFiftyYears", "date": 1619850294000, "content": "A7C vs A7S3 for video /!/ I've seen quite a few reviews online comparing these two cameras.  Fortunately, rather than taking one side or the other, I happen to own both, and can speak objectively to their pros and cons.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what the A7C does as well or better than the A7S3.  The A7C is a smaller camera.  The range-style viewfinder is more compact and factors into that smaller overall size.  Maybe you don't even use the viewfinder in your application, in which case you'll definitely appreciate that it isn't making a significant addition to bulk and heft, as the viewfinder does for other cameras in the A7 lineup.  The A7C also has a higher photo resolution, at 24MP - vs 12MP on the A7S3 - which makes it a better hybrid/multi-use camera.  If shooting in reasonable lighting conditions, the picture quality produced by the A7C is close enough to parity with the A7S3 that you probably won't be able to notice a difference.  Finally - and maybe most importantly to some - the A7C is also roughly only half the price of the A7S3, despite still being a full-frame camera, that can shoot high-quality 4K video.\n\nSo with those things in mind, it might seem like a waste to pay double for the bulkier A7S3.  And for many, the A7S3 won't be worth it.  But, there are a number of things the A7S3 does better than the A7C, and they may matter to you.  Let's start with some of the more obvious/well known ones, and work our way down from there.\n\nWhile the A7C can shoot 4K video at 24 or 30 FPS, the A7S3 also has 60 and 120 FPS options available - especially useful for shooting slo-mo clips.  The A7S3 supports shooting 4K video with 10-bit color, whereas the A7C only supports 8-bit.  This mostly matters if there is a lot of dynamic range in the video you're shooting, and especially if you'd like to shoot using some variant of S-Log color for more color-correction flexibility in post.\n\nAnd while the A7C does quite well in low light, the A7S3, with its 12MP full-frame sensor - and referred to by various titles along the lines of the \"king of darkness\" - is even better; maybe the best modern camera available today for extremely low-light, and can produce usable video in lower light than you would likely feel comfortable walking around in. Also, while the A7C does pretty well on 4K video recording runtime when set to high-temperature mode, the A7S3 does significantly better still in this category - which for some will be the very most important and deciding feature.\n\nThe A7S3's viewfinder is significantly better, in both a more ergonomically friendly location, and sporting a significantly higher resolution.  The A7S3 has four custom buttons vs the A7C's single custom button - actually the A7S3 has more like 5 customizable buttons on the body if you count the also-customizable AEL button.  Five vs one is a big difference.  The longer you use the camera and the more comfortable you get with it, the more you care about those custom buttons - which can be mapped to things like the extremely-useful focus assist, white balance adjustment, etc.\n\nThe A7S3 also has a front dial - typically mapped to aperture - and a joystick - typically used for adjusting the autofocus focus point.  The A7C has neither of those.  The new menu system on the A7S3, in addition to being more convenient to use - and supporting direct touch input - also supports customizing the default back dial rotation function, which I have set to control ISO.  Being able to control ISO outside of the function menu, makes it convenient to adjust to match against the exposure meter, and without having to tie up any other custom buttons - I haven't been able to figure out a way to make a similar configuration on the A7C (let me know if it exists).\n\nOne that seems to be relatively hidden/hasn't been called out in videos by anyone that I know of - the A7S3 allows for temporarily activating autofocus while in manual focus mode by pressing the AF-ON button.  If you try the same on the A7C, it will display a message saying that AF is disabled when in MF mode. \n\nOn the other hand, one feature that I haven't been able to find on the A7S3 that is available on the A7C, is automatically activating focus assist when adjusting the focus wheel on supported lenses.  You can save mapping it to a custom button that way, by having focus assist automatically activate on adjustment of the focus wheel, and then automatically turn itself back off when you leave the wheel alone for a couple seconds.\n\nThe A7S3 also has two memory card slots vs the A7C's single slot, with the capability to allow swapping of the non-active card during continuous filming, and a full-size HDMI port for a more robust connection vs the A7C's micro-HDMI.  Those memory slots on the A7S3 - in addition to supporting regular high-speed SD cards like the A7C - also support CF Express Type A cards that can handle a higher bitrate; but they are only really needed for 4K@60 and 4K@120 video which the A7C doesn't support anyway.  The A7S3 also supports active image stabilization in camera vs. only passive stabilization in the A7C - though both support stabilizing in post using Catalyst Browse, which is even better, but requires the aforementioned post step, and works best with higher shutter speeds than you'd normally use, so you may end up needing to also add in motion blur in post as well - yet another step.\n\nIn my typical setup, the A7C is used in conjunction with a gimbal, where the lack of custom buttons, missing front dial, and lesser viewfinder are non-issues, and the smaller size/weight is a bonus.  The A7S3 I use handheld, where the better viewfinder, custom buttons, etc., are very useful.  So I like them both; they each have their niche in my setup.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/n2cq8w/a7c_vs_a7s3_for_video/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "a7c vs a7s3 for video /!/ i've seen quite a few reviews online comparing these two cameras.  fortunately, rather than taking one side or the other, i happen to own both, and can speak objectively to their pros and cons.\n\nfirst, let's talk about what the a7c does as well or better than the a7s3.  the a7c is a smaller camera.  the range-style viewfinder is more compact and factors into that smaller overall size.  maybe you don't even use the viewfinder in your application, in which case you'll definitely appreciate that it isn't making a significant addition to bulk and heft, as the viewfinder does for other cameras in the a7 lineup.  the a7c also has a higher photo resolution, at 24mp - vs 12mp on the a7s3 - which makes it a better hybrid/multi-use camera.  if shooting in reasonable lighting conditions, the picture quality produced by the a7c is close enough to parity with the a7s3 that you probably won't be able to notice a difference.  finally - and maybe most importantly to some - the a7c is also roughly only half the price of the a7s3, despite still being a full-frame camera, that can shoot high-quality 4k video.\n\nso with those things in mind, it might seem like a waste to pay double for the bulkier a7s3.  and for many, the a7s3 won't be worth it.  but, there are a number of things the a7s3 does better than the a7c, and they may matter to you.  let's start with some of the more obvious/well known ones, and work our way down from there.\n\nwhile the a7c can shoot 4k video at 24 or 30 fps, the a7s3 also has 60 and 120 fps options available - especially useful for shooting slo-mo clips.  the a7s3 supports shooting 4k video with 10-bit color, whereas the a7c only supports 8-bit.  this mostly matters if there is a lot of dynamic range in the video you're shooting, and especially if you'd like to shoot using some variant of s-log color for more color-correction flexibility in post.\n\nand while the a7c does quite well in low light, the a7s3, with its 12mp full-frame sensor - and referred to by various titles along the lines of the \"king of darkness\" - is even better; maybe the best modern camera available today for extremely low-light, and can produce usable video in lower light than you would likely feel comfortable walking around in. also, while the a7c does pretty well on 4k video recording runtime when set to high-temperature mode, the a7s3 does significantly better still in this category - which for some will be the very most important and deciding feature.\n\nthe a7s3's viewfinder is significantly better, in both a more ergonomically friendly -----> location !!!
