From time to time when the focus button is pressed, it stays in this mode / position even when the button is physically released. Shaking the camera or multiple presses on the focus / shutter button solved the problem temporarily. \n\nHowever, the problem persisted. You find many threads / tutorials to fix it with WD40 or some contact spray. This will not work and will only destroy your camera even further.\n\nI was opening my camera, and found the SMD push button. Finally I found the part number here on reddit. Unfortunetly the post is archived:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/8j8xc3/stuck\\_shutter\\_button\\_in\\_a6300/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/8j8xc3/stuck_shutter_button_in_a6300/) \n\nI ordered the ALPS button SKSDPBE010  from RS-Privat for 0.91\u20ac per unit: [https://www.alps.com/prod/info/E/HTML/Tact/SurfaceMount/SKSD/SKSD\\_list.html](https://www.alps.com/prod/info/E/HTML/Tact/SurfaceMount/SKSD/SKSD_list.html)\n\nVideo of how to open the camera:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PAI0uXjpl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PAI0uXjpl4) \n\nSoldering was more difficult then expected. I used a conventional soldering iron at 300\u00b0C with a fine tip. Tip: unsolder the metal housing in the front between PAD 1 (dot) and 4 and the contact between PAD 2 and 3. Then you can take it off with a fine clamp / tweezer. You will permanantely destroy the smd button, but you have to replace it anyway. Then you can unsolder PAD 1 to 4 by applying the soldering iron for 2-3 s and lifting the button with a fine screwdriver on the edge. \n\nAfter removing the button, apply fresh solder to the contacts and place the new button on top. Heat carefully the solder points and slightly press from the top with something soft to the button to take away some heat and fix it in place. \n\nCheck with multimeter, 2 and 3 are connected to ground (middle contacts), 1 and 4 are the pins for focus and to take a picture.\n\nReassamble and close everything and it worked agian. \n\nBy the way, there are two version of the ALPS switch. A softer and a harder one. The softer one lats 50000 hits, the harder one 100000. I took the harder one and it feels slightly harder now.
