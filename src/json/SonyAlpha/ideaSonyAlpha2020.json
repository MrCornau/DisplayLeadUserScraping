Just wondering if anyone has come across a grip extension or whatever it might be called that provides a larger grip for your hands? Like many of us (especially coming from DSLR) I'm sure we find the grip a little on the small side.  I've tried an aftermarket battery grip I got from eBay to try and balance the monstrous 24-70GM, which I ended up selling. What I'm looking is something that attaches to the tripod mount and fits around the grip without extending beneath the camera like a battery grip? I've see the wooden handles that attach to a cage and sit outside the footprint of the body, but that adds to much width. Basically it would serve to make the grip slightly wider and deeper without extending the size of the body too much?\n\nNot sure if the explanation makes too much sense, but any ideas would be very gratefully received.\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/hoiw0f/grip_extension_not_battery_grip_for_a7x/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "[ideas, make]", "selectorShort": "idea", "MarkedSent": "Grip extension (not battery grip) for A7x /!/ Hi Alpha-fam!
