Even already owning an a7III, I actually love the control layout of the a7C. I'd personally say that I like it as much or more than my a7III. There are a few things that particularly stand out. \n\n* It's properly small and light. This is the reason I originally switched from Canon DSLRs to Sony mirrorless back in the days of the first gen a7. Sony's full frame bodies have since increased in size ever since. Finally, we are where I originally wanted full frame mirrorless cameras to be. Also, If I feel like I want a bigger grip for long lenses, I'll can put on an [accessory grip](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/lhd7p8/really_enjoying_the_wooden_grip_on_my_a7c/) or L -bracket, but honestly, the a7C is fine even using it with my Sigma 105mm f/1.4 Art lens. As light as the body is, it's very stiff and solid feeling in the hand. \n* I actually like the EVF. It's smaller than the a7III but it's just as high resolution (which is totally adequate), and its position in the corner is so much better. No more scrunching my nose up against the monitor... I simply love the \"rangefinder-style\" design layout in terms of ergonomics. With a mirrorless camera, there's absolutely no reason that the viewfinder needs to be centered with the lens. Why are modern camera designs trying to mimic the antiquated constraints of DSLR design? This is how a mirrorless camera should be. \n* Lack of a joystick? I've found that I *prefer* the touch screen especially since you can enable the touch screen as a touch pad for Focus point selection while using the EVF. Under Menu&gt;Toolbox (Setup) Tab&gt;Setup3/6&gt;Touch Panel/Pad, if you set to Touch Panel+Pad and then set Touch Pad Settings to Relative Position and Right 1/2, you can use the monitor as a really fast way (arguably faster than the a7III joystick) to move the focus point while looking through the viewfinder. Furthermore, the offset EVF position makes this configuration even more comfortable than if you used the same setting on the a7III, where your nose gets in the way. With the default AF-ON button behavior, this also allows you to instantly define your tracking point for AF-C lock on tracking via the touch screen, making for instantaneous switching between AF-S focusing and AF-C tracking depending on if you're using the shutter half-press or the AF-ON button for focusing. \n* Video AF tracking. This is a *huge* upgrade to the a7III's tracking and the a7III was already damn good. It has dramatically increased my confidence in my camera to maintain focus for a video shots. In order to make this more accessible, I leave touch tracking on by default and I've added the \"Func. of Touch Operation\" menu item to the My Menu in order to make this quicker to select between the\"touch focus\" and \"touch tracking\" settings for being able to use tracking with video or the more traditional focus point selection for stills.\n* Fully articulating screen. Seriously, this should be on every ~~Sony~~ camera body. Low slung shots, high overhead shots, top down shots, selfies, landscape orientation, portrait orientation, vlogging. I'm not sure I need to say more. \n* An extra custom dial mode. Now we get a 3rd custom mode dial setting as opposed to just 2 on the a7III. If you're not already using these on your Sony cameras, you need to spend the time to set them up. I've got each of my 1, 2 and 3 modes set exactly how I prefer to use my camera for 1: main vlog 4K recording, 2: slow motion 1080p60 b-roll, and 3:very slow motion 1080p120 b-roll. \n\nI understand why this body doesn't receive as much love as the a7III / RIV / 1 / 9II / SIII bodies, but I think that in the right hands and with the right configuration it's arguably a more enjoyable design than those cameras.

But beyond that, composition tends to be explained by things like the \"rule of 3rds\" - which works well at emulating human vision tendencies at normal focal lengths such as 35 or 50 mm, but is not really suited to wide angle or telephoto.\n\nOn a normal camera lens - tilt/shift lenses being the exception - the focal point is the center of the capture area at the focal distance.  This is where if you were a human viewing the scene in person, the center of your vision would be at.\n\nIf you can't crop - and again, are not using a T/S lens - this point will always be in the center of the image.  But with cropping, it opens up the possibility to make the focal point the primary consideration when taking the shot, saving composition in terms of where things end up in the final output image for post.\n\nSo instead of taking photos based on how things are composed in the viewfinder, take your photos based on making sure the center of the image is where you want the viewer's focal point to be, and crop as needed afterward.   You can use that focal point to guide the viewer's eyes first to the primary subject, and then - based on the direction that the focal point is shifted from the primary subject - to the next point of interest in the shot.\n\nFor example, say you are taking a photo of someone looking over the edge of a cliff.  Using this technique, you might center the image a couple feet in front of the primary in-focus subject in the direction they are looking, and potentially even tilt the camera to emulate how the subject is looking downward.\n\nAt this point, you don't care about where that puts the subject in the shot composition-wise - only that you end up with enough capture area to include everything you'll want in the final image.  Then in post, you level the image to counteract any tilt you applied when taking the shot, and crop most of it away on the side the subject isn't looking, to place the subject in an appropriate position in the frame and generate the desired composition.\n\nWhat you're left with is an image that first draws attention to the corner where the primary subject resides in the final composition, but then will also draw attention afterward to what the subject is looking at.
