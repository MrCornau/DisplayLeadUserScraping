I got two lenses, the kit lens (f3.5-5.6/28-70mm), and the f1.8/85mm lens.  My primary use case is recording videos of myself using a tripod in my home (hence my interest in the features below).\n\nWith a new toy, I had to play with it a bunch.  As a camera, it works better than any camera I\u2019ve ever used.  I brought it on a camping trip, and was amazed at how late into the evening I was able to take reasonably clear photographs (at ISO12500).  The focus tracking when recording video with shallow depth-of-field is much better than any prior camera I\u2019ve used.  I could take clear videos of my kids reading books in a dark tent to the light of a single flashlight.  Wow!  My kids think the slow-motion recording feature is neat.  The only \u201ctaking pictures\u201d issue I\u2019ve encountered so far is that one pixel always comes out bright white, no matter what the color of the area I\u2019m taking a photo of is.  I guess that is what retouching is for, although I\u2019d love a way to map it out and perhaps have it colored based on neighbouring pixels.\n\nIf you want to learn about how great the photos are, how great the videos are, etc. -- just go look for reviews on YouTube.  There are plenty of them.  But as an engineer, I tend to notice the things which are not quite right yet, and figured it would be useful for some others if I listed what I\u2019ve noticed so far.\n\nMany reviewers have pointed out that the menu system is a mess.  But how is it a mess?  It has three problems:  (a) too many options presented in a single flat menu system.  The organization and categorization of menu items is loose at best, with many things crammed in where they don\u2019t really seem to fit.  (b) too many poor abbreviations.  Quick, what is \u201cSet. Face Prty in AF\u201d?  Is it a face party?  Clicking on it reveals the oh-so-clear option \u201cFace Dtct Frame Dsp\u201d.  What?  (c) in a seemingly random fashion you can only select certain menu items in certain modes, only if you\u2019ve not selected other menu items.  Getting something turned on (such as actual silent shooting with no beeps) is hopeless without Googling the answer.\n\nThe camera can be controlled by a cell app.  I\u2019ve tried the PlayMemories Mobile app on Android (on a Google Pixel running the latest Android release 8.1.0).  Getting it to connect via WiFi over a local network is not something I\u2019ve gotten to work.  I can\u2019t get the bluetooth pairing to geotag photos to work.  The WiFi direct connection works -- as long as you don\u2019t mistakenly open a menu or change modes, at which point the connection will probably (but not always) drop.  Once you run this app, Android will tell you that it is draining your phone\u2019s battery -- even after you close the app, swipe it away, and turn off your camera.  You need to force stop it or reboot the phone to stop it from consuming power.  Every time you want to connect your app to the phone (even after a random dropped connection) you need to find the WiFi option deep in the phone menus (strangely you are not allowed to add this one to your custom quick menu) and turn it on again.  This annoyed the crud out of me until I figured out that an NFC tap also seems to turn it on.  So this app is better than not having the app, but has a lot of rough edges.\n\nThere is a desktop app called PC Remote.  Like the mobile app, it promises to let you not have to buy an external monitor for your camera, just use a laptop instead!  I got it to work by plugging in a micro-USB cable.  It worked briefly then failed if I tried using USB-C.  It strangely doesn\u2019t work over WiFi or bluetooth.  The UI is so compact as to be illegible on my Surface Book screen.  It seems that Sony engineers only own (and test on) lower-resolution displays.  Due to my trouble connecting, requirement for a cable, and the tiny display, this is much less useful to me than the flaky cell app -- so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using it (even though it would give me a much larger display).\n\nThe phone supports WiFi.  Cool, can you use that to copy photos to your computer?  It supports that, via ftp -- great!  So I set that up.  I configured an ftp server, and then gave the phone the credentials and IP address.  It worked\u2026 sort of.  To use it, you have to select each and every photo you want to copy.  You can\u2019t just say \u201ccopy them all\u201d.  Or even better, \u201ccopy each photo to my server as I take it\u201d.  That would be too easy.  Worse yet, it arbitrarily refuses to copy video files, it only copies photos.  Photos get placed in a directory named via a random number generator, so after they are copied you have to go hunting for them.  This is a feature which seems not ready for actual use on a \u201cpro-level\u201d camera -- what I\u2019d really want is for the fully-configured camera to just automatically copy photos and videos to my server as I take them, without my getting involved.  Perhaps this will come someday.\n\nOverall, I love the camera -- but some of the features could certainly use some work.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/97awxj/sony_a7iii_geeks_review/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "sony a7iii geek's review /!/ i bought a sony a7iii a week ago.  i got two lenses, the kit lens (f3.5-5.6/28-70mm), and the f1.8/85mm lens.  my primary use case is recording videos of myself using a tripod in my home (hence my interest in the features below).\n\nwith a new toy, i had to play with it a bunch.  as a camera, it works better than any camera i\u2019ve ever used.  i brought it on a camping trip, and was amazed at how late into the evening i was able to take reasonably clear photographs (at iso12500).  the focus tracking when recording video with shallow depth-of-field is much better than any prior camera i\u2019ve used.  i could take clear videos of my kids reading books in a dark tent to the light of a single flashlight.  wow!  my kids think the slow-motion recording feature is neat.  the only \u201ctaking pictures\u201d issue i\u2019ve encountered so far is that one pixel always comes out bright white, no matter what the color of the area i\u2019m taking a photo of is.  i guess that is what retouching is for, although i\u2019d love a way to -----> map !!!  it out and perhaps have it colored based on neighbouring pixels.\n\nif you want to learn about how great the photos are, how great the videos are, etc. -- just go look for reviews on youtube.  there are plenty of them.  but as an engineer, i tend to notice the things which are not quite right yet, and figured it would be useful for some others if i listed what i\u2019ve noticed so far.\n\nmany reviewers have pointed out that the menu system is a mess.  but how is it a mess?  it has three problems:  (a) too many options presented in a single flat menu system.  the organization and categorization of menu items is loose at best, with many things crammed in where they don\u2019t really seem to fit.
