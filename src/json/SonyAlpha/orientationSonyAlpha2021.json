While set to record video in 24p, I recently noticed that when I have the lcd screen flipped out and facing forward in selfie mode and power the camera on, the image on the lcd flips back to a non-mirrored orientation. So for example, when I move my head to the left, the image on the screen has my head moving to the right. I have to manually flip the screen up / down or back / forth for it re-orient itself back into the proper mirrored display. This only happens in 24p and not other frame rates or photo modes.
