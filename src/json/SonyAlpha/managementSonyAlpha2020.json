Is the A7RIII gonna last me longer than the A7III? Honestly I was looking towards the A7RIV but 61mp is a bit overkill for me and will just make file management harder. I'd rather just use the money towards some glass. I like the extra resolution the A7RIII brings but literally everyone is going nuts over the A7III. Whichever it is, I was going to pair it with the Zeiss Planar T\\* 1.4/50, and the Sigma 14-24mm F2.8 Art. Thanks for any feedback, really appreciate it.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/gg69q1/sony_a7riii_or_a7iii/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "file management", "selectorShort": "management", "MarkedSent": "sony a7riii or a7iii? /!/ i've been looking to upgrade and all week i've researched what sony i should buy. is the a7riii gonna last me longer than the a7iii? honestly i was looking towards the a7riv but 61mp is a bit overkill for me and will just make -----> file !!!  -----> management !!!  harder. i'd rather just use the money towards some glass. i like the extra resolution the a7riii brings but literally everyone is going nuts over the a7iii. whichever it is, i was going to pair it with the zeiss planar t\\* 1.4/50, and the sigma 14-24mm f2.8 art. thanks for any feedback, really appreciate it.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 40015, "year": "2020"}], "name": "managementSonyAlpha2020"}
