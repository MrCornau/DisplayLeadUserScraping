Outside of my holidays I rarely take pictures on trips. The majority of my pictures consist of landscape and city photos, as well as portraits of my wife.\n\nI started with a Canon EOS 400 with a Tamron. Due to bacteria and the fact that I never changed the lens I came to my current Panasonic LX100. I liked the small construction very much. Over the years I notice that the resolution is not enough for me. You don't have any crop possibilities and there is always a lack of zoom. Since I like to create portraits of my wife, I also wish a little more dof. From the lowlight performance I also wish for a little more. A today's Google Pixel creates partly low-noise pictures. In addition, there is now some dust inside and cleaning is not possible.\n\nNow I would like to buy a new camera. I am now looking for a solution with which I hope to make a qualitative jump. Since I do not like to exchange lenses, there should be a very good all-rounder. I don't want to have a compact camera anymore, because you have to throw everything away after a few years.\n\nThe question that I ask myself now is if I would buy an A6400/6500, for example. Would there be a lens to recommend and would the difference to my LX100 be noticeable? At the moment I also have an eye on the A7III with the Tamron 28-70. Of course this solution is much bigger and more expensive, but I hope for a big jump here. But I'm a little afraid of the size, so maybe you won't always take the camera with you. Also I am not always sure when looking at pictures here. There are pictures of people there you can see every skin pore, but also again pictures that look average what my LX100 also performs. Also many night shots are blurred and partly not nice to look at. But here I assume that these were taken out of hand and are not due to the camera. What also strikes me is that you always see a lot of noise in the pictures. I don't have that at the moment.\n\nSummary:\n\nWould an A6400/6500 with only one lens be an improvement on my LX100? Or would the purchase be a waste of money?\n\nDoes it have to be an A7III? \n\nMy last solution would be to put it completely on a mobile phone, e.g. Google Pixel 4. I would go back a few steps, I would miss Zoom etc. but for that I would have a device which I always have with me and no additional costs.\n\nI just don't know if I should just take 3k\u20ac in my hand, if there is an interim solution, or if I should hang up my hobby.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/csxg09/new_purchasing/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "SonyAlpha", "result": true, "Selector": "i like to create", "selectorShort": "create", "MarkedSent": "new purchasing /!/ hello, everybody.\n\ni am a hobby photographer and it is important to bring high quality pictures from my holiday home. outside of my holidays i rarely take pictures on trips. the majority of my pictures consist of landscape and city photos, as well as portraits of my wife.\n\ni started with a canon eos 400 with a tamron. due to bacteria and the fact that i never changed the lens i came to my current panasonic lx100. i liked the small construction very much. over the years i notice that the resolution is not enough for me. you don't have any crop possibilities and there is always a lack of zoom. since -----> i !!!  -----> like !!!  -----> to !!!  -----> create !!!  portraits of my wife, -----> i !!!  also wish a little more dof. from the lowlight performance i also wish for a little more. a today's google pixel creates partly low-noise pictures. in addition, there is now some dust inside and cleaning is not possible.\n\nnow i would like to buy a new camera. i am now looking for a solution with which i hope to make a qualitative jump. since i do not like to exchange lenses, there should be a very good all-rounder. i don't want to have a compact camera anymore, because you have to throw everything away after a few years.\n\nthe question that i ask myself now is if i would buy an a6400/6500, for example. would there be a lens to recommend and would the difference to my lx100 be noticeable? at the moment i also have an eye on the a7iii with the tamron 28-70. of course this solution is much bigger and more expensive, but i hope for a big jump here. but i'm a little afraid of the size, so maybe you won't always take the camera with you. also i am not always sure when looking at pictures here. there are pictures of people there you can see every skin pore, but also again pictures that look average what my lx100 also performs. also many night shots are blurred and partly not nice to look at. but here i assume that these were taken out of hand and are not due to the camera. what also strikes me is that you always see a lot of noise in the pictures. i don't have that at the moment.\n\nsummary:\n\nwould an a6400/6500 with only one lens be an improvement on my lx100? or would the purchase be a waste of money?\n\ndoes it have to be an a7iii? \n\nmy last solution would be to put it completely on a mobile phone, e.g. google pixel 4. i would go back a few steps, i would miss zoom etc. but for that i would have a device which i always have with me and no additional costs.\n\ni just don't know if i should just take 3k\u20ac in my hand, if there is an interim solution, or if i should hang up my hobby.", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 13852, "year": "2019"}, {"autor": "jtxhd", "date": "2019-06-04 15:51:43", "content": "Help with resetting the photo folders/directory on my a6000 without deleting my photos! /!/ https://i.imgur.com/DIkVTq8.jpg\n\nSo I\u2019m not sure how to do this, but I know i\u2019m in the right place in Settings.
