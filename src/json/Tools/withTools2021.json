The roller is made up of a frame of 1/8\" steel plate with a hole in each end, and three spindles, each with a set of different sized cylinders for their respective ring sizes. One spindle end is inserted into the frame and the other lays in a cutout on the other end, and has a latch that locks it in place. Each cylinder on the spindle has a hole of each size drilled into the surface into which then end of the appropriate sized wire is inserted. The crank handle is then turned manually, rolling the wire (which is mounted on a spool) into rings of the intended size while the other hand guides the wire onto the cylinder. Once the number of rings desired is rolled the tension is backed off, the wire is cut and removed from the roller, and cut once more to separate the individual rings.\n\n[Pics of the ring roller and parts](https://imgur.com/a/3f6SMMQ)\n\nThis setup came from a man who is a master woodworker. He has made everything from drums, houses, kayaks, and even replicated an antique saw-the-lady-in-half box from the 20s (I WISH I had pics of this!!) that is now in service in the magic theater in our tourist town. He came up with this design, and it has worked for him for many years prior to my acquisition. 2 years in and the inevitable happened - it failed. Layers of the wood he compressed and treated (with what I don't remember, but can find out) finally separated and now the handle just turns the whole shaft but not the cylinders. I knew this was coming eventually. I do have time to work on this, as I don't need these rings sizes immediately. Backup is a manual, one-at-a-time roller that isn't near as convenient.\n\nI checked with a machine shop, and still have another one or two to check with, but the figure I have so far to remake this has been way out of the budget, and I will most likely be rebuilding this myself if it is going to happen and not break the bank.\n\nNotes:   \nThe \"gear\" on the spindle by the crank does not currently serve a purpose. There is significant springback with the coiled steel, and it needs to be controlled while releasing the tension, and the gear added too much incremental stop on the release where a third hand was needed to hold on to the wire, control the crank, and release the gear stop.
