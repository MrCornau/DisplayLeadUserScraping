Hopefully some of you will find this useful and maybe I can save some newer or less experienced guys from the wallet-ache and mistakes I have made.\n\nA little background first. I am a hardcore DIY mechanic and engine builder going on 11 years now. At 15 my father said if I wanted a car I was going to have to build one. At age 18 I got my ASE certification and had a running  4 bolt splayed 383 stroker, t56 swapped 89 camaro all paid for by parting out a rare trans am. I am a bit older now but still have that car and have had a few other projects of similar magnitude. After realizing the pains of auto repair I decided to go to college and leave the auto stuff as a hobby. My car knowledge comes from both physical experience and priceless boomer experience. I'm talking master mechanics and machinists who date back to the cold war and have been doing this stuff for 40 years plus and drive pro-street cars that make your bitcoin billionaire lambo look like its standing still. Regardless I am not even close to as knowledgeable of a mechanics/machinist as these guys but I have a bit of their passed on knowledge. My dad is boomer master mechanic and I can't thank him enough for all he has taught me.\n\nI am not going to ramble into cars as this is a tools subreddit but that is a look into my direct application of my tools. I have experience woodworking but that's condensed to basic stick framing and decking. Nothing fancy. As such here are my philosophies.\n\n1) For the DIY mechanic anywhere from highly experienced to just purchased your first car. YOU DO NOT NEED SNAP-ON, MATCO, MAC, SK, CORNWELL, ANY TOOL TRUCK BRAND TOOLS. These tools have their place. I know people like to rag on people that use these tools and in a lot of scenarios they are correct. However there are reasons they exist and they produce some of the best mechanics tools money can buy. Whether the price is justified or not is up to the mechanic. As for the DIY guy. It is a complete waste of money. My advice is to look for a set of USA made craftsman sockets wrenches etc on the second hand markets or go with new Taiwanese made stuff. Either way they will both serve you just fine and you won't notice the difference in quality unless you use them 40 hours a week. For the few hours you're under the car once a week it will hardly matter. You will be in the trenches. You will be in the shit. Forget snap-on, youre gonna need that 300 dollars for liquor to get over how brutal life is when you can't fit a 2 post lift in your garage.\n\n2) Massive toolboxes are wasted floor space unless you need one. As a DIY guy you will not have a nice 2 or 4 post lift. You will be working bent over the hood or lying flat under the car with maybe a foot of headspace above you if you're lucky (trucks get a pass). When you are under the car, covered in filth and have to crawl back and forth to a large toolbox to grab what you need multiple times you will wear much quicker. My advice is to purchase multiple smaller boxes such as the craftsman ball bearing 3 drawer boxes or large plastic ones or even the tool bags as an alternative and place them within arms reach before you crawl under. I keep multiple smaller sized boxes on a larger tool car with jack stands, towels, solvents etc and take it all off the cart and place it around where I'll be working on the ground. I rarely have to get out from under the car this way. Furthermore when your girlfriend or buddy needs a fix its much easier to throw smaller boxes into a car than have to go and pull from some whale 72in box and hope you have everything after packing it up for 30 minutes. Use multiple smaller boxes with your socket sets and Wrench's in one, pliers and speciality tools in another and leave the rest on the cart right next to you with the most used items on the lowest shelf within arms reach. \n\n3) Tools to purchase. This is an easy one. Avoid bullshit like Wera, that literal garbage is shilled on this sub like no other and for anyone doing serious automotive work it is complete trash. Massive ratchet heads. Horrible wrench design. All at an Absurd Price. If you want to buy a set that will give you reddit karma and infuriate you everytime you're in a tight spot because it doesn't fit and is better of being used as a door stop then by all means buy Wera...their screwdrivers are nice tbh. Otherwise save your money and buy something worthwhile. Old, second hand USA stuff is great and in my opinion the best option. Anything from Craftsman to Snap on wrenches, sockets and ratchets. If you can afford it and its reasonable I'd go for it. Especially the older USA craftsman stuff. All the old heads I know use it. I've used it extensively for 11 years and never broken a thing. Ive taken 4lb sledges to the craftsman 3/8ths ratchets and broken free multiple control arm bolts with them many times before I had air tools. The Wera ratchets I own (regrettably) would have exploded. They feel as though they belong putting an IKEA set together and nothing else. Wera belongs in pictures in the latest gossip magazines and nowhere else. Wera is like the plauge. If you can't find old USA stuff. The new stuff coming out of Taiwan is equally good if not better. Either way you will not be upset and you'll have money for go fast parts instead of a useless ratchet in your hands (Wera). Regarding pliers, Knipex is amazing. Channellock is great too but really, the hype around Knipex is deserved. In my opinion Channelock for snips and pretty much all pliers and Knipex for their cobras/slip-joint pliers. I prefer slim handled versions of pliers as comfort grip pliers take up way to much space especially in tight areas. Sometimes you will be using a plier with your finger tips by the very end of the handle and those mm's add up. When you strip a bolt 10 miles deep in the shit, when your neck is bent in 10 different places just to see how bad you stripped it, you will at least have a chance with the Knipex. Otherwise you're gonna be welding, grinding or drilling. Screwdrivers, really anything works. Again I prefer USA craftsman acetate handles because they're invincible but even the free stuff I've gotten from Harbor Freight works fine. Just this past week I found a 450 piece USA craftsman socket and ratchet set for 130 bucks shipped off Facebook marketplace. Its my second set as its identical to the first set I bought 11 years ago. I will keep them as backups to my first set. It took me a couple months of near daily searching to find them but they're out there.\n\n4) Go with cordless over air. With that said I mainly use and prefer air tools for most tasks but I have that luxury. If you're starting out and having to choose between the two definitely go with the cordless stuff over air. Much more practical and economical and does 90% of the stuff air can do. Only time you will want air is when you start getting into  stuff like sandblasting and heavy air tools like 3/4 inch stuff an air hammers powerful enough to shake your fillings loose. For power tools I personally go with DeWalt however Milwaukee is equally great if not better and I'm sure just about anything will do. I've always used DeWalt with great success even for automotive applications and have zero complaints. I'm sure many brands would be great and the new stuff coming out from most brands will cover most jobs you will need them for. I'd just advise looking at the tool offerings and prices for each brand because once you build up a decent battery cache you'll be stuck with that brand.

true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "tool philosophy /!/ i am going to attempt to give people a look into what i consider to be a well rounded approach and varying philosophies to what separated man from ape, tools. hopefully some of you will find this useful and maybe i can save some newer or less experienced guys from the wallet-ache and mistakes i have made.\n\na little background first. i am a hardcore -----> diy !!!  mechanic and engine builder going on 11 years now. at 15 my father said if i wanted a car i was going to have to build one. at age 18 i got my ase certification and had a running  4 bolt splayed 383 stroker, t56 swapped 89 camaro all paid for by parting out a rare trans am. i am a bit older now but still have that car and have had a few other projects of similar magnitude. after realizing the pains of auto repair i decided to go to college and leave the auto stuff as a hobby. my car knowledge comes from both physical experience and priceless boomer experience. i'm talking master mechanics and machinists who date back to the cold war and have been doing this stuff for 40 years plus and drive pro-street cars that make your bitcoin billionaire lambo look like its standing still. regardless i am not even close to as knowledgeable of a mechanics/machinist as these guys but i have a bit of their passed on knowledge. my dad is boomer master mechanic and i can't thank him enough for all he has taught me.\n\ni am not going to ramble into cars as this is a tools subreddit but that is a look into my direct application of my tools. i have experience woodworking but that's condensed to basic stick framing and decking. nothing fancy. as such here are my philosophies.\n\n1) for the diy mechanic anywhere from highly experienced to just purchased your first car. you do not need snap-on, matco, mac, sk, cornwell, any tool truck brand tools. these tools have their place. i know people like to rag on people that use these tools and in a lot of scenarios they are correct. however there are reasons they exist and they produce some of the best mechanics tools money can buy. whether the price is justified or not is up to the mechanic. as for the diy guy. it is a complete waste of money. my advice is to look for a set of usa made craftsman sockets wrenches etc on the second hand markets or go with new taiwanese made stuff. either way they will both serve you just fine and you won't notice the difference in quality unless you use them 40 hours a week. for the few hours you're under the car once a week it will hardly matter. you will be in the trenches. you will be in the shit. forget snap-on, youre gonna need that 300 dollars for liquor to get over how brutal life is when you can't fit a 2 post lift in your garage.\n\n2) massive toolboxes are wasted floor space unless you need one. as a diy guy you will not have a nice 2 or 4 post lift. you will be working bent over the hood or lying flat under the car with maybe a foot of headspace above you if you're lucky (trucks get a pass). when you are under the car, covered in filth and have to crawl back and forth to a large toolbox to grab what you need multiple times you will wear much quicker. my advice is to purchase multiple smaller boxes such as the craftsman ball bearing 3 drawer boxes or large plastic ones or even the tool bags as an alternative and place them within arms reach before you crawl under. i keep multiple smaller sized boxes on a larger tool car with jack stands, towels, solvents etc and take it all off the cart and place it around where i'll be working on the ground. i rarely have to get out from under the car this way. furthermore when your girlfriend or buddy needs a fix its much easier to throw smaller boxes into a car than have to go and pull from some whale 72in box and hope you have everything after packing it up for 30 minutes. use multiple smaller boxes with your socket sets and wrench's in one, pliers and speciality tools in another and leave the rest on the cart right next to you with the most used items on the lowest shelf within arms reach. \n\n3) tools to purchase. this is an easy one. avoid bullshit like wera, that literal garbage is shilled on this sub like no other and for anyone doing serious automotive work it is complete trash. massive ratchet heads. horrible wrench design. all at an absurd price. if you want to buy a set that will give you reddit karma and infuriate you everytime you're in a tight spot because it doesn't fit and is better of being used as a door stop then by all means buy wera...their screwdrivers are nice tbh. otherwise save your money and buy something worthwhile. old, second hand usa stuff is great and in my opinion the best option. anything from craftsman to snap on wrenches, sockets and ratchets. if you can afford it and its reasonable i'd go for it. especially the older usa craftsman stuff. all the old heads i know use it. i've used it extensively for 11 years and never broken a thing. ive taken 4lb sledges to the craftsman 3/8ths ratchets and broken free multiple control arm bolts with them many times before i had air tools. the wera ratchets i own (regrettably) would have exploded. they feel as though they belong putting an ikea set together and nothing else. wera belongs in pictures in the latest gossip magazines and nowhere else. wera is like the plauge. if you can't find old usa stuff. the new stuff coming out of taiwan is equally good if not better. either way you will not be upset and you'll have money for go fast parts instead of a useless ratchet in your hands (wera). regarding pliers, knipex is amazing. channellock is great too but really, the hype around knipex is deserved. in my opinion channelock for snips and pretty much all pliers and knipex for their cobras/slip-joint pliers. i prefer slim handled versions of pliers as comfort grip pliers take up way to much space especially in tight areas. sometimes you will be using a plier with your finger tips by the very end of the handle and those mm's add up. when you strip a bolt 10 miles deep in the shit, when your neck is bent in 10 different
