Mother's Day 2020 edition /!/ A lot of my tools saw action this weekend.  I've been cleaning my garage over the last few weeks, and it was cool to be able to find/get to everything for a change...\n\nFirst, I made a small mod to my workbench - a pencil tray on the front.  I'm forever reaching for a damn pencil, and they're stored in my tool chest or tool cart - both are steps away from the workbench.  Annoying.\n\nSaturday on a whim, I got out a fair number of tools - my router, my shop vac (for dust collection), my circular saw, screw drivers, clamps, drill and bits and some other stuff.  I took some scrap-wood, buddied it up in my wood vise with a sacrificial piece and with the 1/2 round bit in the router I cut a channel.  I hadn't used the router in a while, and I'd intended to cut it straight, but had some...control issues...that brought it out closer to the edge in the center than I'd expected.  I got out a chisel and smoothed out some of the edges and decided the mistake worked - easier to get my fingers there to grab the pencil.  I grabbed my little block plane and relieved the edges, then sanded everything round and smooth.  I drilled some holes so the wood wouldn't split when I screwed it to the bench.\n\n[Time for a test-fit](https://i.imgur.com/kU92GPc.jpg).\n\nAck.  I cracked it a little on the right.  Meh - it's a workbench.  I took it off, put a screw in (carefully) to open the crack and then smeared wood-glue into the crack and clamped it.  After it dried, I dug up a counter-sink bit to reduce the stress of the screws, sanded it some more, and slapped some Danish Oil on it (to match the workbench).  That night, I gave it a healthy second coat and left it overnight.  \n\n[Here's the finished result](https://i.imgur.com/dcgweQ6.jpg).  I definitely could have made it more attractive, but literally I didn't enter the garage with the idea of doing anything like that and wanted some beef for the screws.  The good news is the mistakes didn't hurt me and it works like I want.  :)  \n\nThe other thing I did was replace the hinges on ten of our kitchen cabinets on Sunday.  I've still got a few more to do, but the ones I replaced were, for the most part failing or tired.  We built the house 19 years ago in June :).  That job involved my drill and my M12 Surge 1/4\" impact (which was an absolute rock star) and a couple Wiha screw drivers.  I sheared a couple of the (really crappy) screws, so my Knipex Cobras and my GrabIt screw extractor kit made a quick appearance also.  It's probably the most I've used the screw drivers since I got them - love the handles on them a lot.
