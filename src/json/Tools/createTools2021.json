Today I want to introduce a no-code app building tool I've built for IoT applications. It's called **Canvas**. I took the inspiration from Blynk and solved the limitation in it by building it as an app layer on [Grandeur](https://grandeur.tech/) backend.\n\nThis is how it works:\n\nYou program your hardware with the SDK of Grandeur. Then you can login to [Canvas](https://canvas.grandeur.tech/) and drag and drop widgets (like buttons and displays) to build a layout. You can bind these widgets with your device variables, so you can change and monitor the value of a variable and build the hardware logic around it. This way, you can focus on prototyping your hardware without spending time on coding apps.\n\nI made a tutorial on how to use it. Check it out on hackster:\n\n[https://www.hackster.io/team-grandeur/introducing-grandeur-canvas-92b090](https://www.hackster.io/team-grandeur/introducing-grandeur-canvas-92b090)\n\nSince it is based on Grandeur, when you are done with prototyping, you can use the app SDKs of Grandeur to code your own app in JS or React.\n\nIt's inspired from Blynk but unlike Blynk,\n\n\ud83d\ude0e Canvas is limitless. Create unlimited layouts; add as many widgets as you want.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 It is entirely browser-based. You can share your layouts to external testers and they won't need to install anything.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 You can use it in commercial applications.\n\n\ud83d\udcaf When ready, you can build your custom app and reliably scale. Your hardware code will seamlessly work with your custom app.\n\nThis project is still in an early phase and there are only four widgets available at this stage. But I am working on adding graph, table and few other widgets. Let me know what you want to see in it.
