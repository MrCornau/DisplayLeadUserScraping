I've bought myself a used car that I want to work on, and I've been burning through DIY videos trying to get as much knowledge as I can, but the time has probably come to jump in and get the tools I need.\n\nThe car is a 2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse, so I think I will need metric sockets. I'm not sure what size ratchet to buy though; I had a Pittsburgh Pro 1/2\" Extendable Ratchet in my hand at Harbor Freight today but I chickened out because I felt like I didn't know if I was buying the right thing. Mainly, I wasn't sure what the purpose of the smaller sizes was or whether 1/2\" was the right size for what I need. If you've ever been in my position, most of these auto DIY videos will briefly mention tools, but don't go into much depth about why that tool specifically, or what your other options would be.\n\nSo far I have these things:    \n- 3 Ton Trolley Jack    \n- Pair of 2 Ton Jack Stands    \n- 24\" Breaker Bar 1/2\"    \n- Black+Decker 5.2AMP 3/8\" Drill/Driver (Corded)     \n- Bare minimum basic home repair toolkit\n\nI intended to buy a tool kit (or individual tools) today, but there were multiple price levels that included different things and I wasn't sure exactly what I need and what I probably don't yet. I had the $200 300+ piece Pittsburgh kit in my hands, but I have no idea if that kit is overkill for my needs or not. For me it's a bit of a hefty pricetag, but I'm willing to drop the cash if it has just about everything I need for a solid price.\n\nI'm totally lost trying to decide whether to buy a nice ratchet, torque wrench, adjustable wrench and some metric sockets; or a full on kit. If it's the kit, there's the question of which one for the money. I'm also not sure whether or not a cordless impact tool can replace the need for some of these things.\n\nThese are the jobs I plan on tackling in the near future:    \n- Cold Air Intake Install    \n- Change Spark Plugs    \n- Drain and replace all fluids    \n- Replace brakes/rotors    \n- Lowering springs or coilover install     \n- Replacing the exhaust and eventually the headers    \n- Car stereo upgrade/rear camera install    \n\nI also have a massive rust spot on my hood (bubbled up pretty bad, but smaller than a bar of soap) that needs to be sanded, filled, painted and polished/buffed. I assumed that I could find a decent sander/polisher combo powertool that would be up for the job, but once again I drowned in the available options. The price ranges are so wild, and there's so many tools that seem suitable (rotary tools, multitools, adjustable speed orbital sanders with polishing attachments, detail sanders). Harbor Freight was also missing most of the accessories for these, so it was hard to tell which of the tools could both sand and buff. If anyone could tell me a reasonably priced tool that can do this job (or even the specific kind of tool I should be looking at, and I can research from there on my own).\n\nAny guidance I can get here would be incredible.

I'm completely new to this and only have youtube videos to teach me, but it seems like a juice groove in a cutting board should be fairly simple.

Would it cost me as much to build my own as it would to just buy a pre-built unit?  The plus to DIY, obviously, is that I can set it up however I like based on suggestions from others and my intended uses.

My counter part was a retired engineer turned teacher who managed the \"frontlines\" with our students teaching the classes while I managed the grant, organized fieldtrips, worked with the leadership board and so forth. Unfortunately, my partner in crime moved on to a different district at the end of last year, and so I have stepped up to take over our Senior Capstone Course and am now in charge of the upkeep and organization of our Maker Space. \n\nUnfortunately, I am finding myself in a position right now with our Maker Space where I am throwing out and donating more than I am keeping. The only place where my previous co-director and I didn't agree on was that he was of the mentality to \"Buy more for cheap\" whereas I am of the mentality of \"Buy smart, even it means you get less.\" A prime example is that he outfitted our Maker Space a few years ago with Ryobi Power Tools, because they were cheap. I'm not knocking Ryobi, they are great tools for the price and certainly can get the job done, but that said we are VERY fortunate that our Academy is currently funded by a significant state grant. However, we have no idea if this grant will last another 20 years or another 2, and so I am making strategic moves right now like replacing our Ryobi Power Tools with Rigid due to Rigid's Life Warranty on parts, bateries, and accesserie. This way if our grant gets cut or oes away completely,  years down the road we have an awesome warranty supporting our power tools. Like wise I am replacing all the inexpensive hand tools and tool storage with Husky, due again to an awesome lifetime warranty.\n\nLast bit of background on the Space and its current condition is that it also looks very \"pieced together\" and my goal this year is to ge the space looking more uniform. As an example, we have 3 different brands/styles of shelving in here that I am replacing with all one kind of Husky shelving because I believe the visual aesthetic of space is also very important for the kids to give them a sense they are in a \"professional space\" vs a space that looked like it was created through garage sale finds. \n\nANYWAY- that's where I am at the moment...

I understand these items are ultimately built to wear out over time, but are their better ones than others out their I'm assuming?

Looking to get a good pliers, side cutters, etc kit! /!/ So first off, I guess you could say I'm a Kobalt fan boy.  Yeah, let me hear it.  I'm a big fan of Kobalt's 24V power tool line, and I have a lot of them there.  The majority of my current hand tools are also Kobalt, with a small portion being Craftsman or whatever I picked up from Tractor Supply Co.  My Kobalt sockets, they're great...very happy with them.  Kobalt and ICON ratchets?  Love them.  Craftsman ratcheting spanners?  Happy with them.  Random assortment of Kobalt/Craftsman/Dewalt/JobSmart screwdrivers?  I've never been in a situation where I didn't have the screwdriver I wanted.  Large kit of Craftsman bits, all good there as well.   \n\nWhat I'm NOT happy with is my assortment of Kobalt and similar brands of pliers (needle nose, lineman, slip joint, side cutters, etc), as well as vise grips, wire snips, and similar.  They all do the job, but they don't last.  Cutters get dull, the rubber grips break free from the metal and tools slip out of the handles, etc.  It's the one thing in my tool box that I'm really not happy with.  \n\nMost importantly, I'm a DIY-er.  Not a professional tradesman (I'm an IT guy by trade).  I do anything from woodworking (have made furniture ranging from cheap pallet type junk, to butcher block tops; made chicken coops, built decks and sheds, etc), automotive work (cars, motorcycles, go karts and mini bikes), electrical work (I've got some decent Klein electrical tools), light welding and fabricating, etc.  Pretty much anything I can do, I do it.  \n\nSo yeah, I've been eyeing Tekton (from Amazon) and Doyle (Harbor Freight) mainly because of the price, but I know Knipex gets a lot of love around here.  I'm looking for a couple sizes of groove joint pliers (8, 10, 12...or around those sizes), diagonal cutters, needlenose/long nose, lineman, maybe compound pliers, etc.  I'd LOVE to find a nice set that had all that, and bonus points if it has an organization tray I can put in my (Kobalt) tool box.  Teng Tools has an 8 piece set (TEN-O-TTD441) for ~$180 that has a tray, but the tray is probably the only reason I'd consider spending on Teng.  Boxo is another brand that has plier sets in foam trays that I've seen.  \n\nAny advise would be GREATLY appreciated!  I don't want to spend a fortune, but I'm a big fan of \"buy once, cry once\" and \"buy it for life\".  Lifetime warranty and easy replacement is ideal.  I also figure buying a kit (or multiple kits) would be cheap than buying individual tools.  \n\nSEND HELP", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/ihneya/am_i_wasting_money_with_tekton_or_similar_or/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "Tools", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "am i wasting money with tekton (or similar), or should i just pay the extra for knipex? looking to get a good pliers, side cutters, etc kit! /!/ so first off, i guess you could say i'm a kobalt fan boy.  yeah, let me hear it.  i'm a big fan of kobalt's 24v power tool line, and i have a lot of them there.  the majority of my current hand tools are also kobalt, with a small portion being craftsman or whatever i picked up from tractor supply co.  my kobalt sockets, they're great...very happy with them.  kobalt and icon ratchets?  love them.  craftsman ratcheting spanners?  happy with them.  random assortment of kobalt/craftsman/dewalt/jobsmart screwdrivers?  i've never been in a situation where i didn't have the screwdriver i wanted.  large kit of craftsman bits, all good there as well.   \n\nwhat i'm not happy with is my assortment of kobalt and similar brands of pliers (needle nose, lineman, slip joint, side cutters, etc), as well as vise grips, wire snips, and similar.  they all do the job, but they don't last.  cutters get dull, the rubber grips break free from the metal and tools slip out of the handles, etc.  it's the one thing in my tool box that i'm really not happy with.  \n\nmost importantly, i'm a -----> diy !!! -er.  not a professional tradesman (i'm an it guy by trade).  i do anything from woodworking (have made furniture ranging from cheap pallet type junk, to butcher block tops; made chicken coops, built decks and sheds, etc), automotive work (cars, motorcycles, go karts and mini bikes), electrical work (i've got some decent klein electrical tools), light welding and fabricating, etc.  pretty much anything i can do, i do it.  \n\nso yeah, i've been eyeing tekton (from amazon) and doyle (harbor freight) mainly because of the price, but i know knipex gets a lot of love around here.  i'm looking for a couple sizes of groove joint pliers (8, 10, 12...or around those sizes), diagonal cutters, needlenose/long nose, lineman, maybe compound pliers, etc.  i'd love to find a nice set that had all that, and bonus points if it has an organization tray i can put in my (kobalt) tool box.  teng tools has an 8 piece set (ten-o-ttd441) for ~$180 that has a tray, but the tray is probably the only reason i'd consider spending on teng.  boxo is another brand that has plier sets in foam trays that i've seen.  \n\nany advise would be greatly appreciated!  i don't want to spend a fortune, but i'm a big fan of \"buy once, cry once\" and \"buy it for life\".  lifetime warranty and easy replacement is ideal.  i also figure buying a kit (or multiple kits) would be cheap than buying individual tools.  \n\nsend help", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 25, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/ihneya/am_i_wasting_money_with_tekton_or_similar_or/", "identifyer": 388565, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 388593, "autor": "Got_ist_tots", "date": 1598460456000, "content": "Any possible easy fix for broken oscillating tool? /!/ I have a Rockwell Sonicrafter oscillating tool that I've used for light DIY stuff for the past few years.

I think I initially got sucked in by the LSA.  I've never had to use it as I'm just a DIY guy.  I'm not hard on my tools and don't use them a heck of a whole lot.  However, I'm currently amidst a complete bathroom remodel (all the way to the bones.)   I've had to cut through some old plumbing while in a crawlspace.  It's a dirty environment, and there is bound to be a little moisture present when cutting out old plumbing.\n\nAnyway, today, I noticed that the battery level lights on the pack attached to the recip saw were staying illuminated (3 of the 4).  The tool still worked fine.  I tried putting the battery on the charger, and it said it was fully charged.  I took the pack apart (4 ah pack) and found that there is NO protection for the BMS board that is mounted above the cells.  Any dirt and/or moisture can enter at the release buttons, or contacts.  The BMS board itself isn't sealed or protected.  Just completely exposed.\n\n Eventually, the indicator lights blinked and shut off.  Now, it's dead.
