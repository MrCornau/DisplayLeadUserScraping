I'm about to put a lot of my tools into storage and need something useful that I can be mobile with. I'd like to be able to use it around the house as well as throw it in the car for longer road trips/camping. Also being able to grab the bag and go out into the driveway without going into my longer term storage is ideal.

It seems like those Atlas 46s rolls are pretty popular, however I wonder if they are more a pain in the ass to use vs just being popular. A tool bag seems easier to carry around.
