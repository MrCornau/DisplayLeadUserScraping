I\u2019ve got a used SL and a summicron 50 f2 6 bit with Leica adapter. I hope you can help me with a couple of questions. \n1) is it normal it doesn\u2019t show the f number on the screen while shooting but only after one shoots? I thought one of the points of the original adapter was to hand over aperture too? Also, it happened a couple of times already that even though in M the lens was at f2, shutter speed at 1/125 it shot at a different (random) aperture. Again, issue with the adapter?\n2) difficult shot at night in the deck with low light of my baby forehead, picture once downloaded was very much ok but on the screen it had a significant amount of red/pink spots on his skin\n3) Lightroom for iPad, does it have the right Leica profiles for DNGs or what I\u2019m missing from the desktop/laptop version? My workflow currently is import straight from the SD Card in iPad Lightroom, edit what\u2019s needed and export the JPGs in the iPad camera roll and from there add them to my albums\n4) if I wanted to shoot JPEG directly, what suggestions would you give in terms of in camera settings?
