I'm just wondering if anyone has any special tips for using non-rangefinder lenses on Leica rangefinders. I've come back to using rangefinders in recent years, having been lucky enough to get an M8 about 6 years ago. Not being minted, Ive mainly used a lovely old Canadian Leitz 28mm and the Minolta branded 35mm f2 M-Rokkor. It's the closest thing to a 50mm I've found that works nicely with the crop sensor. I'm super happy with these lenses and I love the quirks of the M8 (mine seems particularly quirky).\n\nThe issue is that recently I took the notion of finding a decent cheap fast 50. I like the idea f an old Canon, but I spotted a Konica AR 50mm f1.4 online and it was within my self-imposed lower price range, so I picked up it and an adaptor. The adaptor finally arrived yesterday and I put them together. I can handle the fact that it's now super nose-heavy and I love the signature of the lense at f1.4 ...the problem is you have to guess the focus. It utterly did *not* dawn on me what I had just done was to put an SLR lense on a rangefinder and I wouldn't have any feedback for focus, that I would have to guess the distance. At f1.4 that's a risky prospect indeed.\n\nAnyone here got any handy tips or tricks for doing this to this? I'm happy to play around with it (which was mainly the point). It wasn't an expensive mistake and it should be clear by now that I'm purely an enthusiast. If I'm missing a megathread with my request, I can repost there.
