First of them finally being in my hands, the Thambar-M. Naturally, I have been using it for 99% of my photography since purchasing it, to test it in wide variety of conditions. I am extremely pleased with it.\n\nYesterday, I went out in the woods. I had my Leica M3, the Thambar-M and a 50mm Summicron V5. The weather was a bit unstable, but that is nothing new here in Finland. At least the light was nice.\n\nOr so I thought until I got to the aforementioned woods. It was rather dark. Not a humongous issue, Thambar-M having maximum aperture of f/2.2, or f/2.3 with the included filter in use. I did have to go down to 1/125 shutterspeed, but it is still fast enough for some larger wildlife taking it easy.\n\nAnd then the rain started. So I stood there, taking cover under the leaves, while fiddling with settings. I was out testing the Thambar-M, so I would test it, regardless of the weather. Then I saw movement farther away, deep in the woods. Bushes were moving rapidly, not due to wind or rain, but by something hitting them. I admit, my thoughts went into bears and how screwed I might possibly be.\n\nUntil the culprit revealed itself, dashing from the bushes. A large hedgehog going full speed ahead. I barely could keep myself from laughing. I managed to lie down to hide myself, behind a large tree. Checked my settings, and started photographing.\n\nThe long focus throw of the Thambar-M was marvelous. I kept the focus on the hedgehog with surprising ease, while it ran at me. And I do mean at me. Very nearly hit me, before noticing me. Much to my surprise, it did not run away. \n\nInstead it kept stuffing its face, with whatever it catched. I thought I saw a worm or two. The rain had awakened the critters, and the buffet was ready for the hedgehog. For the next 10 or so minutes it stayed in the area, basically letting me freely to photograph it. It was a little suspicious about the sound the shutter of my M3 made, but soon ignored it. During this whole time I was in the ground, in a rather uncomfortable position. I didn't want to stand up and scare the animal.\n\nAfter it had finished the buffet, it dashed back into the bushes it had appeared from. I chose not to go after it, not wanting to stress the animal. It had already given me a fantastic opportunity to test my Thambar-M. \n\n*The conclusions of the trip:*\n\n1. The long focus throw of the Thambar-M suits me and my kind of photography very well. It aids in focusing a lot. I wish more lenses had this long focus throws.\n\n2. The Thambar-M has a great lens hood. It is the kind you just push in. There is no separate locking mechanism, nor is it screwed in. Regardless, it stays put. It feels very solid, and not once was I afraid it would get loose and just fall. That happening in a forest would be a nightmare. Good luck in finding it.\n\n3. The dual nature of the Thambar-M is even more fun I had thought. I had thought I would mostly enjoy this lens wide open, soft focus spot filter in use. I have found I also greatly enjoy the effect the lens causes at smaller apertures. At f/6.3 for example, the out of focus areas get this very distinctive look, while the in focus areas are sharp. A photo of a gull still has great feather detail.

I was taking photos of a building and I remember that the building was composed upright (I used the frame lines and focusing patches to make sure of that). After I\u2019ve taken the first photo, I looked at it in the LCD and found it look crooked, took 3 more while making sure the building is upright straight, the result is the same - tilted clockwise by a few degrees. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but it\u2019s more noticeable when I was using the 90mm Summicron, and not a 35mm lens.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem of posture. I tried the same camera-holding position with my other non-rangefinder camera and images are upright straight 100% of the time.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find an answer anywhere online.

After years of wanting to get into film photography I\u2019m finally in a position to dabble a bit but I\u2019m still very new. I bought a Pentax K1000 that came with its traditional lens but I was always enchanted with the Leica iiif, and after some eBay shopping I was finally able to snag one in good condition. However the lens it came with is a Nikkor 135 (https://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/nikkoresources/RF-Nikkor/RF135mm/index1.htm)\n\nLuckily it came with a viewfinder for that length and also one for 35mm for some reason.\n\nMy question is this: I\u2019ve been told I should probably get a 50mm lens since 135 is mostly for portrait and I really would like to do street/landscape/and nature so a 50mm lens would be good. I like the idea of a collapsible lens since it would make the camera a little easier to transport, but the Summicron and Summitars are pretty pricey. I intend for this new lens to be my daily driver so I\u2019ve seen forums where they say they\u2019re more collector items and something like a 50 Elmar 3.5 lens would be better. I\u2019ve also seen YouTube reviews by Matt Osborne who likes the Cannon 50 f/1.8 LTM lens a lot. I guess my question is what do you all recommend for someone starting off but a lens that will grow with me? I can\u2019t afford a Summicron but am willing to spring for a Summitar if that gives a general idea of price point.\n\nAlso, any thoughts on wide range? Is that a lens I would need for nature or landscape?
