Am I Making The Right Choice? /!/ Hi!  \n\n\nJust going to put this bluntly, I've been primarily interested in data science starting from my freshmen year at University, but I kept it at a bay and break for sometime because of University work and other personal issues.  \n\n\nNow, I'm heading towards my semester ending and my Summer break starting, and I really want to dive deeper and deeper into all this. But since the last year, I realized that apart from just being a data scientist, I wanted to be an actual software engineer. Software Engineering is a complex combination of various talents, ideas, from different fields and branches of knowledge, and I have been so far somewhat successful in understanding how fully fledged, actually usable software is made.  \n\n\nAnd the more I think about it, the more I start to think and realize that for me, data science has been about developing models and getting good measures of precision and recall, fine tuning it according to the data, but in actual realistic scenarios, data science isn't really the top priority for any new startup, or company just trying to develop a scale-able, maintainable, and agile software. There are far many factors into it, and data science and building models just seem to be a part of it, but not the entire thing itself. I see data engineering and data analysis as being far more valuable to companies for the following reasons,  \n\n\n1. Companies often just need a good overview of the data they have so that they can extract meaningful features out of it. This requires good knowledge of statistics on the theoretical basis, and on the practical basis, SQL + R + figures and diagrams to explain the nature of data should be fine, i.e., data analysis. Data Science and model training seems to be just not what employees need most of the time. And besides, the easier the idea behind the figures are, the easier it is to explain to cooperates who need to make rational decisions. A good statistical notion combined with simple linear or logistic regression seem to be just enough.\n2. Because of the influx of the data that is growing data by data, companies just need a good workflow and pipeline to maintain how the data is stored, accessed, and modified - they need data engineers for every day related tasks to data. But on the other hand, you don't need data scientists making models for the coming data on a daily basis, and since data science is so easy to pick up with easy to learn languages and libraries, it seems highly likely that companies would rather ask the data engineer to look over that part as well. Hiring another person, integrating + training + making him part of the team seems to be much more of an expensive move. \n\nI might be missing something here, but these are the ideas and thoughts that I had. Here is what I have done so far in Data Science,\n\n1. Almost completed the Introduction To ML and DL Specialization by Andrew Ng.\n2. Started Kaggle somewhat - have to still make a team for it.\n3. Gone through the Python libraries, Tf, and PyTorch. Not very big things to talk about, but yeah, I'm familiar with Python.\n\nThoughts and ideas appreciated.
