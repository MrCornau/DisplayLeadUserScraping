Notes made after a month and reviewed after nine months.  It is very condensed compared to other writings. It contains a lot of notes for those who are eyeing to take the plunge into LF, as they say. And also some notes about what to look for in a LF camera. It is detailed, because I like details. And it is not only technical, but also about what it means to the subject. It's a long read, but since Reddit got me started in analog and \"caused me to buy a Mamiya m645 SLR, I thought it would be nice to share.\n\n\n**Documenting persons**\n\n* People like posing for the view camera way more than they do for my Mamiya m645.\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n* People are now asking me to make portraits based on my results, rather than on my invitation or the attractiveness of my hardware. That said, I have since bought a Wista 45dx, that is way more attractive than the Intrepid 4x5 mkII. I use the same lens, so the photo is the same, but a wood and brass camera helps. It's a starting point, and I can build on it.\n\n\n**The focusing proces**\n\n* The cover over my head needs to be light tight for better sight. I got a nice tightly woven cloth for this. \n\n*Addendum after nine months:* \n* led balls in the seem help holding it in place.\n* To check the focus on the ground glass, I need some magnification. Found out that a loupe is not for me. I found composing a pain when using a loupe. It puts me at a distance emotionally. Well, and my eyesight is not good enough without reading glasses, which hinders using the loupe.\n* A pair of cheap +4 reading glasses allow me to oversee the whole ground glass, and down the the details, with my head some 20cm from the ground glass. So this is my method now. (I normally use +1 fore reading.)\n\n\n**The viewfinder**\n\n* Focusing upside down is a nice abstraction that makes me compose better. It reminded me of having to put my drawings upside down in the painting class, to see what I needed to change.\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n* I do not even remember seeing the image online. It's something that is just a given and not important anymore. Since it rotates rather than mirrors, like the waste level view finders do, setting up the shot is less confusing than it was when I began shooting with my Mamiya m645.\n* I inverted my thinking about focusing. It is not something you dial into the lens. The lens is fixed. It projects a 3D image behind it, in which everything is sharp somewhere. I place my ground glass, and ultimately the film inside of this 3D projection. Only then it becomes 2D, and the location of the film plane is determines what is in focus. It would have made even more sense if the film plane was what was rolling in and out on these cameras.\n* Focusing very closely gives the sense of zooming in too. I heard people on youtube going mad about the \"focus drift\" that their \"full frame\" zoom lens has. Ha, they should see what happens if you focus in on someone half a meter from your LF.\nA fresnel\n* I bought an el cheapo (40 euro) fresnel for the ground glas. I wrote I'd report back. It's okay. The purpose is to bend the light that is off center, towards you, reducing vignetting. It will not change the image on the film. If you do not want vignetting on your film, close the aperture a bit (and lengthen the shutter time). The fresnel is a composing tool, as you can overlook the whole focus screen in a glance. It's not a focusing tool at all. Contrary to some guy on youtube who made a movie that google pushes at you when you search for fresnels, the fresnel goes on the OUTSIDE of the ground glass. It would trow your focus of if you'd mount it on the inside, as it would sit in between your lens and your focus screen that way. You do not want that.\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n* I can now compare the el cheapo to the fresnel that came on my Wista. The Wista's is much finer. But it does not really matter too much in practice. Would buy it again.\n\n\n**Movements**\n\nOn a large format camera you can move the lens up and down (rise and fall) and left to right (shift) for perspective control, and tilt/swing the lens for focus control. These are called movements. The intrepid only has lens movements, the Wista also has tilt, swing and shift on it\u2019s back (the film plane).\n\n* I love shifting for perspective and tilting for precise focusing. I knew this from toying around with my digital mirrorless and some adapters. Lens tilt is much more intuitive then it is on my digital camera with a tilt-adapter. One reason is that because the image is not flipped right side up, I can see in my minds eye how the projection of the image works. Also, on a digital system, there is a swivel halfway between the lens and the sensor that allows for tilt. And the barrel of the lens is longer too. It works much much more intuitively when you really only tilt the film back or the lens plate, rather than bending the whole system halfway. \n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n* I shoot so much more portraits than other things these days, that I hardly ever use shifts and rises anymore, only to fake back tilt on the Intrepid. As I expected, I use tilt and swing a lot, as to get two eyes and a mouth in focus. I really do this naturally. This why I wanted a large format field camera to begin with; I missed movements on the Mamiya SLR.\n* differences between the cameras: The Intrepid tilt axis runs right through the lens, while the Wista's pivots at the base. This makes tilting the lens more intuitive on the Intrepid. That said, it is too easy to knock out of place when cocking the shutter on the Intrepid. And the focusing process with tilt is iterative on both camera's anyway. It's just that I do not lose focus so much while setting the tilt on the Intrepid, as I do on the Wista. On the latter, there is this moment of disconnect after deciding I need the tilt.\n\n\n**The workflow**\n\n* The fact that you slide the film holder in after the composing and focusing is done, has an upshot. To determine when to trip to shutter is done by looking at reality, not through a device. To me, this feels more real, and thus better. \n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n*I found that my subjects connect way more to me when I shoot this way. I might start doing like this digitally too: Just stand next to my camera rather than behind it.\n* I am a musician &amp; sound technician, so here's my perspective on the workflow in sound studio terms: Contrary to the SLR, a large format camera feels like recording. I set up the mics and the volumes, I give the band my directions and focus points, they get ready, and at the right moment I punch in the recording, and from that moment on, it is just them. Photography feels the same now. I feel like I make a registration, a document. An SLR feels like barging into the recording room, rather than quietly pressing record in the control room.\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\nI also started directing shots like I direct singers in the my sound studio. I came to the realization when [Stephen DiRado](http://www.stephendirado.com) told me to listen to what was there to hear, while he made a portrait of me. He is such a great help in all this, and we became good friends.\n* I do no not make them wait, and I will no longer wait on somebody to change anything in their expression after I just told them to freeze, while they are essentially waiting for me to go click. I give them something to do, something to think about, something to listen too and to look at. A focuspoint, other than their own looks. This is similar to me in the studio, go over a text with the singer, and imagine a setting, a purpose, and an audience for them to see in their minds eye when performing their song. If I wouldn't, every recording would sound like \"He's recording this, let's not make any mistakes again, aaah\".\n* Though I ruined a few sheets, the workflow is not as bothersome as I expected it to be. But I must say I rehearsed the process in my mind a number of times before the camera arrived. \n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n*I expanded a bit on the routine. Set focus, close lens, set shutter and aperture, fire a testshot, slide in film holder, check if lens is closed, cock shutter, open film holder, check subject, fire. All this time I keep communicating what I do, and I say \"hold still\" a lot. And I make jokes. People tell me I welcome and relax them. Good. Honestly, my mind is occupied with the tech side of the process too. You see, there are quite a few things I need to do between focussing and taking the picture. This is why my subject should hold still, not because the shutter times a that long. \n\n\n**Depth of field**\n\n* Shooting a larger format does not make the DoF shallower directly. But a 150mm lens has a similar field of view as a 50mm on a 135 (35mm)camera, and that long focal length comes with a less deep DoF. It looks like a f1.4. When you shoot close ups, backgrounds go way out of focus. When you shoot at a medium distance, say 4 meters, the background *still* goes out of focus. You need to be very precise with selecting what you want in focus, and therefor you will need tilt and swing.\n* I almost always shoot wide open, f5.6 on my lens, which means I have 1cm depth of field when I do a close up portrait. I use the full range of the shutter. From 1/400 to a full second. \n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n* When focusing close ups, the bellow gets to be extended a lot more. This spreads the light form the lens over a larger area. You will need to double the shutter time that the meter suggests to compensate for this.\n* For regular scenes, mylightmeter app is okay. For more contrasty scenes, the contrasty camera of the phone has a hard time guessing. A dedicated meter will be better.\n\n\n**The negatives**\n\n* I like it that you can develop per sheet, thus per frame, and adjust dev times as you go along.\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\nI standardized the development, making light on the film the only variable, and I develop per four. That's two film holders. I often shoot 4 or 8 frames now. I typically carry 5 film holders, so I can screw up 2 frames and still fill two tanks. I do not ruin films that often, though.\n* I'm not into this because I like developing, or scanning. I develop the same evening, I postpone scanning a lot.\n* I like that the negative is not microscopic. As soon as you pull it from the water, you can see how it is!\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\nThe size feels very normal to me now. Not at all big anymore. That happened really fast.\nSome more notes on the quality camera\n\n*Addendum after nine months:*\n* It is really really important that you can lock any variable on the camera very securely. It is annoying that the Intrepid can be detuned so easily. This ruins shots. Focus may slide off when I tilt the camera back and do not thoroughly lock it. Rotation on the tripod cannot be locked well enough, causing the camera to be rotated sideways a bit when sliding in film into the rough plywood. Swing is annoyingly easy to ruin when setting the shutter dials. In these respects, the Wista is so much better.\nThe Wista is twice as heavy as the intrepid. But with all the other stuff you need (tripod, dark cloth, filmholders, glasses, lens, shutter release, light meter, filter) it does not matter that much.\nIt's just that I'd hate to be the one to make the first scratch on the 46 year old Wista, while I decided that the intrepid is for hiking. I was worry free when it got sanded on a black beach of Iceland and rained on on Martha's Vineyard. That's a feature the Wista does not have.\n\n**But most importantly**\n\nPhotographing this way brought me personal contacts in a way that music never did. To me, it was a journey full of surprises. Going large format improved the quality of my portraits a lot. And the size of the negative was the least relevant in that upgrade. With a 4x5, I was able to make very honest and direct documents of the people that are dear to me. The tool is no longer sitting between me, my eyes, and them. It is just an extension of me, standing next to me.\n\n**some results**\n\n[click!](https://www.facebook.com/krosov/media_set?set=a.1740699366055952&amp;type=1&amp;l=bf98b90b0c)", "title": "Things I learned while going from medium format SLR to a large format view camera", "num-comments": 43, "score": 1, "date": "2018-12-17 14:31:03", "content": "Things I learned while going from medium format SLR to a large format view camera /!/ **Things I learned while going from medium format SLR to a large format view camera.**\n\nThese are the notes I kept after I just bought an intrepid 4x5 camera.

I've spent the last few weeks building both a hand rotary and now have a working prototype for a motorized one.

The hand roller is mostly the same - just two sides without the motor mount.\n\nIt works with my development controller I've been working on (while also working on my Film Log webapp) also but the moto-rotary could be used on its own with a direct 12V source, a simple timer/h-bridge circuit, etc. It's not much more than 3D printed parts I designed plus things common to 3D printing (608 bearings, all-thread rods, etc.). It's not the most optimized but for a version 1 I feel it's usable at least for my needs if nothing else.\n\nMy idea is to try and build DIY/kit components so folks can use part or the whole thing. Already have a Sous Vide? Then you don't need to worry about temperature controlling the water bath and can let the controller manage the rotary and optionally be your development timer. Don't want a rotary, you can use the water bath features. Want to control multiple water baths? You could do that too.\n\nMuch like Prusa did with 3D printers, the idea was to make part (or all) of it open source/open hardware.\n\nI favor an iterative design over a JOBO-clone because Imean honestly a JOBO is going to be awesome, especially with a lift. This is for folks that want something cheaper (but less good haha) and configurable. It seems like trying to make an easy to build kit for what a JOBO is, at least right now, I think is out of reach. So instead of trying to do that all at once, I think there might be value in doing it in pieces.\n\nThoughts?", "title": "I made a DIY Rotary - would folks be interested in this?", "num-comments": 17, "score": 1, "date": "2018-12-13 22:27:32", "content": "I made a DIY Rotary - would folks be interested in this? /!/ Been posting a lot on the Discord channel but thought I'd bring the conversation here as well.
