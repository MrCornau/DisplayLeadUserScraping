Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my sister who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.\n\nYou just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend.\n\nI like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as hell &amp; demons, a beautiful house in heaven etc.I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.\u00a0 My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush.\n\nThe strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps &amp; is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.\n\nOther than drawing, I like reading whether it is newspaper, news, novels, G K book or any knowledgeable book written by any good author. I always read story books, newspaper, magazines, and any other material that I find interesting in my free time. This hobby of reading books of mine was first noticed by my father and he motivated me by saying that it is a very good habit given to you naturally, never let this habit off and keep it in practice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n   \n   \n from WordPress http://bit.ly/2WGWlx7", "title": "Its My Blog\u2026.So its ME Time now\u2026 MY HOBBIES", "num-comments": 1, "score": 1, "date": "2019-06-13 06:06:13", "content": "Its My Blog\u2026.So its ME Time now\u2026 MY HOBBIES /!/ My hobby is\n\n**cooking**\n=======\n\n**drawing**\n=======\n\n**listening music**\n===============\n\n_However I always prefer Drawing._\n\nEvery one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my sister who always encourages -----> me !!!  to -----> design !!!  her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.\n\nYou just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend.\n\nI like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as hell &amp; demons, a beautiful house in heaven etc.I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.\u00a0 My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush.\n\nThe strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps &amp; is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.\n\nOther than drawing, I like reading whether it is newspaper, news, novels, G K book or any knowledgeable book written by any good author. I always read story books, newspaper, magazines, and any other material that I find interesting in my free time.

I've been doing my own amateur stuff for a few years now and I feel I have a very good grasp of it, I took a few courses in my last year of high school but they didn't really teach much I didn't already know. \n\n2. Is it hard to make money from photography? I love photography and I would really love to do it as a profession but one thing I've always struggled with was that I don't see how to start making money from it or how you can get steady income from it unless you're REALLY good.\n\n3.

It'd be best if you get a low down of the type of gear i have before anything else. I've got maybe 1-2 years experience in photography but all from an amateur level. I've done travel, weddings and events before and havent had any standardized learning methods, just go in and shoot kinda thing. All unpaid, just wanted some experience. (I can provide links to some wedding photos/videos that i've shot)\n\nCamera body: Sony A6000\n\nLens: Kit Lens 16-35 F3.5-5.6\n\nMobile: Samsung S8\n\nMobile Lens: Moment 18mm wide  \nStabalizer: DJI Mobile\n\nWhat do i mainly use this gear for?  \n\n\nI'm hoping to do a lot more Vlog type stuff, and also use something for travel. Ideally i'd like to use a mirrorless camera, rather than use my phone or something like the DJI Pocket. (more on that later.) The reason being is that i know that using a 'real' camera presents me with more options as a photographer/videographer rather than using an out of the box solution such as what's presented on Phones or purpose built tools like the DJI Pocket. I'd like to learn how to use a camera properly rather than rely on auto or what values are present on an app or program. I also want some specific features that arent available in Phones/DJI pocket such as 4K res, 120fps, Ability to use primes for Bokeh, etc. For all intents and purposes i'd like to stick within the Sony Mirrorless ecosystem if i'm gonna go full on the camera path.  \n\n\nWhat sort of stuff do i film/edit?  \nHere's the latest video i shot - Using my S8 and DJI Mobile Stabalizer. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpSuIRz-tcs  \n\n\nSo what exactly do you need?  \n\n\nCurrently i'm struggling between three decisions, I dont have all the money in the world so ideally i'd like to spend less than \u00a3500, i'll most likely sell my other gear if i make a decision.  \n\n\n1.) Buy an upgraded Body - At the moment my A6000 fits what i need but i feel like there's a lot of things which can be improved on. Ideally i'd like a front facing camera and i heard the new A6400 will have this feature. Ideally i'd like a body that will allow me to shoot in 4K and something that will let me shoot in 120fps in 1080. Something that'd also be good (And is a plus to me buying a new body) is buying a prime lens. I'd like to get better at bokeh-type photos and currently my kit lens isnt doing much of that unfortunately. I like my kit lens but i feel like it does have limitations.\n\n2.)\u00a0 Buy a DJI Pocket - I feel like this little thing is da bomb. It's small, compact, shoots in 4k and.120fps, has sick stabalization and looks like a good vlogging tool. The only downside for this is that its a first gen and i rarely buy first gens due to unforseen bugs/issues. The other thing to consider this is that its not a 'proper' camera so it goes against what i mentioned above, i'd learn how to use the camera but not in a way that would be easily transferable if i use a standard camera. Not sure how this performs in low light, but otherwise from the reviews that ive seen i'd be pretty happy with this set up!  \n\n\n3.) Expand my Mobile gear - I shot the video i linked to all in my Samsung S8 (Without the moment lens) and the results are insanely good. 4K looks amazing and i cant believe it was shot all through my phone. The only downside is that my S8 is terrible in low light (as expected) and it suffers from the same pain point as number 2 - its not a 'real' camera so it's a bit problematic in terms of learning.  \n\n\nRight now i'm leaning towards 1 &amp; 2.

Don't be shy! Newbies welcome! /!/ Have a simple question that needs answering?\n\nFeel like it's too little of a thing to make a post about?\n\nWorried the question is \"stupid\"?\n\nWorry no more! Ask anything and /r/photography will help you get an answer.\n\n---\n\n#Info for Newbies and FAQ!\n\n* [This video](http://vimeo.com/41174743) is the best video I've found that explains the 3 basics of Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO.\n\n* Check out /r/photoclass_2018 (or /r/photoclass for old lessons).\n   \n* Posting in the Album Thread is a great way to learn!\n\n&gt; 1) It forces you to _select_ which of your photos are worth sharing\n\n&gt; 2) You should judge and critique other people's albums, so you stop, think about and express what you like in other people's photos.\n\n&gt; 3) You will get feedback on which of your photos are good and which are bad, and if you're lucky -----> we !!! 'll even tell you why and how to -----> improve !!! !\n\n* If you want to buy a camera, take a look at [our Buyer's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index#wiki\\_what\\_can\\_i\\_afford.3F) or [www.dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/)\n\n* If you want a camera to learn on, or a first camera, the beginner camera market is very competitive, so they're all pretty much the same in terms of price/value. Just go to a shop and pick one that feels good in your hands.\n\n* Canon vs. Nikon? Just choose whichever one your friends/family have, so you can ask them for help (button/menu layout) and/or borrow their lenses/batteries/etc.\n\n* /u/mrjon2069 also made a video demonstrating the basic controls of a DSLR camera. You can find it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSKqgZxM108)\n\n* There is also /r/askphotography if you aren't getting answers in this thread.\n   \nThere is also an extended /r/photography [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index).\n\n---\n\n#PSA: /r/photography has affiliate accounts.

I think i have a good grasp on it now, but wanted to create visuals, because I am a visual learner. Here is what I found, hopefully it helps someone else!\n\nThe way I plan to do this is by using a [depth of field calculator](https://www.pointsinfocus.com/tools/depth-of-field-and-equivalent-lens-calculator/) and messing with variables to create graphs. I will be using the \u201cDepth of Field: Total\u201d as my output variable. Anyone looking for some way to quantify bokeh, use the inverse, half the DoF means twice the bokeh. I am doing this because bokeh is not only dependent on the subject distance but the object distance, so using DoF instead minimized the variables I have to work with. This is an important distinction because if you change the distance to the subject, then you also change the relative distance to the background. So ignoring that is (quite frankly) just laziness on my part, but also an extremely important thing to note.\n\nTo start there are exactly 4 variables that can affect the DoF, focal length, aperture, subject distance, and crop size (this one is indirect). Lets start with some base system: 50mm, f/4, 3m, and 1x crop size. Now lets see how adjusting the Aperture affects this DoF, so the only thing that will change is the aperture.\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/XikDyne.png)\n\nThis is pretty straight forward, it\u2019s not a linear relationship, especially how DoF is calculated, but it should be enough to see the drop off. Also please note the aperture only shows the number (so 4 instead of f/4) and is logarithmic (to make the lower apertures easier to see).\n\nNow lets go ahead and look at focal length, so same f/4, 3m, and 1x crop size, but with a variable focal length.\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/zajrKy8.png)\n\nAgain notice the log scale, now while this was something I understood, the area it started messing with me, was it didnt account for change in the subject. Like if I were to shoot a portrait, and I switched from a 50mm to an 85mm, I would also move to make my model the same size. So what would actually be useful is a chart showing the DoF relative to focal length with a corrected distance, which is below:\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/A6PucLl.png)\n\nThat vertical axis is NOT a log scale, meaning that even going from 19mm to 600mm has a change in your DoF of about 10cm so long as the subject the same size! In fact, from 50mm on up, which is the entirety of the recommended portrait lengths, it makes functionally no difference! This was shocking to me, honestly. Using my 600mm and dealing with the drop off made me think the focal length had more of an effect than I thought.\n\nFinally lets talk about crop factor. The fact is, crop factor does not affect your DoF (shocked pikachu face). What it does, is change the focal length you need to get the same picture, which in turn changes the DoF. So lets do the same thing, plot the change in DoF over different crop factors, while adjusting the focal length to keep the subject the same size.\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/Z66IQhH.png)\n\nAnd just as a bonus, lets show the DoF changing over the crop factor, but keeping 50mm and adjusting the subject distance instead to keep the same subject size.\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/eY0tklN.png)\n\nIf anyone is bored and wants to see the raw data [here is my spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VlhfPe6EZ42i061DtBFcaYTukR0pwrqL2xVH2uGNIvQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n", "title": "A visual guide to Depth of Field, and how different adjustments affect it", "num-comments": 46, "score": 1, "date": "2019-02-09 22:52:30", "content": "A visual guide to Depth of Field, and how different adjustments affect it /!/ When I was new I had a lot of trouble trying to understand how different variables affected the depth of field, mostly when trying to maximize bokeh or dealing with macro. -----> I !!!  think i have a good grasp on it now, but wanted to -----> create !!!  visuals, because -----> I !!!  am a visual learner.

In 2016, I was gifted an Otus 85mm 1.4 which I hoped to use for portraiture - specifically my two babies but I soon realised how tricky it was to nail manual focus on restless babies so stuck with my 24-70 which has been great. I used all the tricks in the book but found I preferred the 24-70 especially when out and about. These days, I still use the Otus a lot but have restricted it's use mainly to portraits of adults, scenery and other things which don't move and giggle constantly when the camera is pointed at them. One issue I noticed with the D800 is the MF focus assist seems to be designed for F2.8 lenses, not F1.4 so as a result, even if the focus indicator was on, the subjects' eye could be front or back focused. To address this, I setup my focus assist adjustment so that the focus assist light turning from a flicker to on would indicate the F1.4 MF being in the sweet spot. So far this hack has worked brilliantly but far from ideal.\n\nFast forward some time, I am thinking about getting a new camera body, preferably one which I can use with the F-mount Otus and one which has accurate manual focus assist tools such as focus peeking.

Before we get down to business, I\u2019d like to take a moment to introduce myself. I\u2019m Chelsea, one of your newer mods here at r/photography. I joined the team a few months ago, after years of lurking turned active participant in our Community Threads. My motivation for coming aboard was to help in anyway I can grow the already very positive and supporting atmosphere of the community threads, and hopefully extend that atmosphere to the rest of the sub. \n\nI\u2019d also be remiss to ignore the recent goings on here in r/photography. I\u2019d like to acknowledge that every single comment has been read and discussed at length by the entire active moderation team. We do not take these comments lightly, and are working as a team to address them. I only ask that you allow us the time to prove that we are making actionable changes. I also ask that if there are any specific concerns you have, that you bring them to our attention via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/photography). We will no longer be having very public debates with the user base over specific concerns. \n\nWith all that squared away, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s been happening in this sub over the past year, and what you can expect going forward.\n\n**Changes Implemented:**\n\n* **The Print Swap:**\n\nThe idea for the print swap came up in a community thread in November of 2017. Being the enthusiastically optimistic person that I am, I agreed to take on the responsibility of organizing it, along with one other regular contributor. We\u2019ve made it through a full year of the swap, and while there are still opportunities for improvement, it has run more or less smoothly and is now into it\u2019s second year.\n\n* **Return of Weekly Threads/Revamp of Monthly Threads:**\n\nFor years this community has had regular themed threads throughout the week. Unfortunately the bot we use to post these no longer functions, and they disappeared. As of autumn of 2018, they were brought back, with some thought out alterations. Related, the monthly threads have also been reworked. These threads are incredibly positive and overwhelmingly supportive to photographers of all levels. Please do not be intimidated to participate in them! The new schedules for these are as follows:\n\nWeekly:\n\nMonday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\nCommunity | Albums | Community | Challenges | Community | Inspiration | Achievements &amp; Goals\n\n\nMonthly:\n\n1st | 8th | 14th | 20th\n---|---|----|----\nDeals | Instagram | Portfolio Critique | Gear\n\n\n\n* **Self Posts:**\n\nAs per [this announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/aabwv4/rphotography_and_selfposts_a_note_from_mods/), our criteria for what constitutes an allowed self-post have become more lax. We\u2019ve seen an immediate impact by this initiative on the front page of the sub. Now, as I type this, 13 of the 20 top posts are self-posts, a major increase from just a week ago. Please note that simple questions such as buying advice still belong in the questions thread, which you can always find stickied to the top of the sub. Also, please see the announcement thread linked above for more information regarding what is allowed. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/a1g5h4/my_thoughts_on_gas_and_what_to_do_about_it/) is an excellent example of a high quality self-post. \n\n* **r/photographs:**\n\nI\u2019m personally very excited about this one. r/photography users have been asking for a way outside of the weekly threads to show off their work with the community. We heard, and we answered with r/photographs. It\u2019s a very fast growing sub, and it\u2019s been amazing seeing all the talent that r/photography readers have to offer. If you want to make it even better, leave some words about your photo: why you took it, how you took it, etc. Also, engage with the other posts in the sub. Let\u2019s grow it to a supportive place for us to learn from each other!\n\n* **The Moderation Team:** \n\nIn the past few months, the team has added two new moderators: myself (hi!) and /u/makinbacon42 (Sean) - with our addition comes coverage of two new time zones (GMT+1 and GMT+8). Little about us: I'm a documentary travel photographer based in Europe, and Sean is a landscape and astro photographer based in Australia. We've both been very active int he community threads for a long time before joining the mod team, so we have a good feel for the community (*one of us. one of us*.) The full team has also had lengthly discussion about the team\u2019s interactions with the user base. More on that later.\n\n___\n\n**Ongoing Changes**\n\n* **Top Voted of the Month (r/photographs):**\n\nI\u2019m very excited to announce that starting now (January \u201919) we will be featuring r/photographs\u2019s top voted post of each month here in r/photography. With the permission of the photographer, the photo with the most votes will be posted here along with a short artist\u2019s statement. This is an excellent opportunity for the community to become more acquainted with the photographers we have here. \n\n* **Themed Prompts (r/photographs):**\n\nEach month we will be giving a photo prompt to get us all out and shooting. Your submissions should be posted as their own thread in r/photographs. You will see the announcement of the first of these prompts in a couple of days over at r/photographs.\n\n\n* **Questions Thread Text:**\n\nWe have completely reworked the verbiage of the Questions Thread body text. As it is, it\u2019s too long, too confusing, and too easy to just scroll right past. The new text is more concise and makes finding commonly asked questions in the FAQ easier. You will see this update very soon.\n\n* **Sidebar and FAQ Rework:**\n\nAs it is, the sidebar is very dense and overwhelming. Also as reddit becomes more and more mobile, it is harder to access. We\u2019re currently in the process of condensing the sidebar to make it easier to wade through. In regard to the FAQ, it is a living document and is and will continue to be updated on a regular basis. \n\n* **Mods Interaction with Users:**\n\nLet me start this by saying the moderation team has done a lot of internal discussion around the topic of how we interact with users. The resolution is that we've identified problematic (sarcastic, escalating, etc.) ways in which we were responding to people asking questions, and problematic ways in which we were moderating (removal messages, etc). We are committed to improving that. You should already be seeing more welcoming verbiage and fewer curt responses from mods to users. We only ask that if you have specific complaints that they be brought to our attention via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/photography). We will no longer be publicly discussing these sorts of concerns, as to avoid escalation of the issue. \n\n___\n\nNow if you\u2019ve made it this far, I both applaud and thank you. Moderating a sub of over a million users requires a lot of nuance. As a team, we want nothing more than r/photography to be a pleasant place for photographers *of all levels* to come and politely discuss the craft. Of course we have a very diverse user base, and catering to the exact wishes of every user is simply impossible. We are always open to feedback, especially feedback with actionable suggestions, and encourage you to send such feedback to us via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/photography). Also you can keep up to date on the goings on here in /r/metaphotography.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nxoxo\n\nBosslady[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/aabwv4/rphotography_and_selfposts_a_note_from_mods/ecqoyx7/)\n\n\ntl;dr: Some changes we\u2019ve made in the past year, and some things to look for in the coming year. kthanxbai.", "title": "State of the Sub", "num-comments": 84, "score": 1, "date": "2019-01-12 16:19:32", "content": "State of the Sub /!/ Hi there r/photography readers!

We\u2019ve made it through a full year of the swap, and while there are still opportunities for improvement, it has run more or less smoothly and is now into it\u2019s second year.\n\n* **Return of Weekly Threads/Revamp of Monthly Threads:**\n\nFor years this community has had regular themed threads throughout the week. Unfortunately the bot we use to post these no longer functions, and they disappeared. As of autumn of 2018, they were brought back, with some thought out alterations. Related, the monthly threads have also been reworked. These threads are incredibly positive and overwhelmingly supportive to photographers of all levels. Please do not be intimidated to participate in them! The new schedules for these are as follows:\n\nWeekly:\n\nMonday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\nCommunity | Albums | Community | Challenges | Community | Inspiration | Achievements &amp; Goals\n\n\nMonthly:\n\n1st | 8th | 14th | 20th\n---|---|----|----\nDeals | Instagram | Portfolio Critique | Gear\n\n\n\n* **Self Posts:**\n\nAs per [this announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/aabwv4/rphotography_and_selfposts_a_note_from_mods/), our criteria for what constitutes an allowed self-post have become more lax. We\u2019ve seen an immediate impact by this initiative on the front page of the sub. Now, as I type this, 13 of the 20 top posts are self-posts, a major increase from just a week ago. Please note that simple questions such as buying advice still belong in the questions thread, which you can always find stickied to the top of the sub. Also, please see the announcement thread linked above for more information regarding what is allowed. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/a1g5h4/my_thoughts_on_gas_and_what_to_do_about_it/) is an excellent example of a high quality self-post. \n\n* **r/photographs:**\n\nI\u2019m personally very excited about this one. r/photography users have been asking for a way outside of the weekly threads to show off their work with the community. We heard, and we answered with r/photographs. It\u2019s a very fast growing sub, and it\u2019s been amazing seeing all the talent that r/photography readers have to offer. If you want to make it even better, leave some words about your photo: why you took it, how you took it, etc. Also, engage with the other posts in the sub. Let\u2019s grow it to a supportive place for us to learn from each other!\n\n* **The Moderation Team:** \n\nIn the past few months, the team has added two new moderators: myself (hi!) and /u/makinbacon42 (Sean) - with our addition comes coverage of two new time zones (GMT+1 and GMT+8). Little about us: I'm a documentary travel photographer based in Europe, and Sean is a landscape and astro photographer based in Australia. We've both been very active int he community threads for a long time before joining the mod team, so we have a good feel for the community (*one of us. one of us*.) The full team has also had lengthly discussion about the team\u2019s interactions with the user base. More on that later.\n\n___\n\n**Ongoing Changes**\n\n* **Top Voted of the Month (r/photographs):**\n\nI\u2019m very excited to announce that starting now (January \u201919) we will be featuring r/photographs\u2019s top voted post of each month here in r/photography. With the permission of the photographer, the photo with the most votes will be posted here along with a short artist\u2019s statement. This is an excellent opportunity for the community to become more acquainted with the photographers we have here. \n\n* **Themed Prompts (r/photographs):**\n\nEach month we will be giving a photo prompt to get us all out and shooting. Your submissions should be posted as their own thread in r/photographs. You will see the announcement of the first of these prompts in a couple of days over at r/photographs.\n\n\n* **Questions Thread Text:**\n\nWe have completely reworked the verbiage of the Questions Thread body text. As it is, it\u2019s too long, too confusing, and too easy to just scroll right past. The new text is more concise and makes finding commonly asked questions in the FAQ easier. You will see this update very soon.\n\n* **Sidebar and FAQ Rework:**\n\nAs it is, the sidebar is very dense and overwhelming. Also as reddit becomes more and more mobile, it is harder to access. We\u2019re currently in the process of condensing the sidebar to make it easier to wade through. In regard to the FAQ, it is a living document and is and will continue to be updated on a regular basis. \n\n* **Mods Interaction with Users:**\n\nLet me start this by saying the moderation team has done a lot of internal discussion around the topic of how we interact with users. The resolution is that we've identified problematic (sarcastic, escalating, etc.) ways in which we were responding to people asking questions, and problematic ways in which we were moderating (removal messages, etc). -----> We !!!  are committed to -----> improving !!!  that. You should already be seeing more welcoming verbiage and fewer curt responses from mods to users. We only ask that if you have specific complaints that they be brought to our attention via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/photography). We will no longer be publicly discussing these sorts of concerns, as to avoid escalation of the issue. \n\n___\n\nNow if you\u2019ve made it this far, I both applaud and thank you. Moderating a sub of over a million users requires a lot of nuance. As a team, we want nothing more than r/photography to be a pleasant place for photographers *of all levels* to come and politely discuss the craft. Of course we have a very diverse user base, and catering to the exact wishes of every user is simply impossible. We are always open to feedback, especially feedback with actionable suggestions, and encourage you to send such feedback to us via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/photography). Also you can keep up to date on the goings on here in /r/metaphotography.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nxoxo\n\nBosslady[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/aabwv4/rphotography_and_selfposts_a_note_from_mods/ecqoyx7/)\n\n\ntl;dr: Some changes we\u2019ve made in the past year, and some things to look for in the coming year. kthanxbai."}, {"autor": "Gnarstache", "selftext": "When I started off doing photography I was in the military and I was able to shoot whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted.

I didn't know exactly what I wanted to shoot, but after shooting a friend who happened to be a model one day, my fate was secured. His agent saw the images, loved them, got me to shoot several of his other models, other agencies noticed and hired me, then magazines, brands, record labels, etc. Rest is history. I'm still far from the photographer I want to be and actually hate most of what I produce, but I'm constantly trying to absorb knowledge and am always experimenting. \n\nMy work as a photographer has always kept me very busy, lending little time to research gear- as such, I never was a \"gear guy\". Recently when my trusty old D800 (which I got right when they came out, in 2012) gave out and I upgraded to the D850, I started researching some lenses (and lights) as I thought it might be fun to do a full rig revamp. Nothing wrong with any of my old gear- I still use it-, I just wanted something new for a change. I got a Nikon 105 1.4, which I'd read amazing things about, the previous owner of which couldn't stop raving about the Zeiss 135 2. I went home and started researching it and a week later found one a couple hours away, which I picked up yesterday. \n\nToday I used the Zeiss on a shoot and had what I can only describe as an epiphany. I never would have believed that a mere piece of gear would be able to elicit such a strong reaction from me, but the Zeiss did just that. The very first frame I shot with it today completely blew my mind and made me rethink everything. I've been shooting professionally for a decade now, but have never once been wowed by a piece of gear- not until today. To me, gear never really mattered. I don't mean in the pretentious as fuck \"I could use an iPhone\" sense... I *could*... and actually *have*(!!!), for a client shoot no less (long story)... I just mean that camera bodies are so good these days that you could get the cheapest entry level one with a 50 1.8 or whatever and be on your way, creating high quality professional images no worries. Up until last week, I only owned three lenses throughout my entire ten year career and really only used two of them (95% 85 1.8 G and 5% 28 1.8G). My main rig was the D800 with the 85 1.8G and that setup yielded killer images which have been published in various magazines across the globe, on album covers for major record labels, etc. and I was honestly convinced that was as good as it got. I didn't even think digital medium format could/would yield *that much* better images. But today I was witnessed to something truly spectacular. Let's get a couple obvious things out of the way... Zeiss lenses are built to a very high standard and are solid as a brick, and they're manual focus. The build quality is the only downside, and that's only because the all-metal construction makes for a very heavy lens, which drains you quicker. The manual focus was something I was worried about, but due to the substantial throw, is a complete non-issue and is in fact effortless and a joy to use. In practice, it only took me a few seconds longer than if I were using AF to really nail focus- and of all the images I shot on it today, only a few were slightly off. I wear glasses fwiw. Then there was the (micro)contrast and sharpness, which are what really shook me. Nothing that I've ever used/owned has come remotely close to this. I never would have imagined that one lens could produce such night-and-day superior/different results over another lens, even of the same focal length. I don't know about MTF charts and all that shit and, frankly, don't care too much about having the sharpest lens, but the sharpness this thing has is like nothing I've experienced before and is truly remarkable. Ditto the contrast situation... I don't actually know if contrast is the right word, but your subjects really come alive when photographed with this lens- a very obviously discernible *POP* is present, leaving images taken on other lenses feeling suddenly very 2D. I know understand why people rave about Zeiss glass so much and realize that all of what I perceived as hyperbole is actually very well substantiated. \n\nI'm not a gear guy in the slightest and never cared about it, but today saw what a special piece of gear can do to your psyche and your work. Not trying to sound cocky, but I know I've got skill with a camera... having a piece of gear like this only helps to elate your work that tiny bit further- and sometimes that tiny bit extra is what can make a good image great. Heck, even the model remarked that she'd never seen herself \"pop\" in an image like that and was stunned at how sharp the images were. \n\nThis lens has me truly rethinking everything... The Nikon 105 1.4 I got just a week ago is nice, but nowhere near the Zeiss (despite costing almost double). I'll probably sell the 105 and use the funds towards another Zeiss, maybe the 100 macro or the 21- I like using wide angles for distorted effect in my portraits lately. Would love to get into the Otus stuff at some point as well. My main lens is the 85 1.8G Nikon- thought about adding the Otus 85 to use in tandem with it, maybe more for projects I'm particularly passionate about. \n\nWould love to hear if anyone else had such a great experience with Zeiss glass. \n\n**TL;DR**, been shooting professionally for a decade, got a Zeiss 135 2 yesterday and shot with it for the first time today... caused an epiphany and yielded the very best images I've ever seen.

Despite the criticism and sometimes\u00a0conflicting\u00a0attitude among our differences, resulting the feeling of being against each other, we are looking for the same through different means.  \n\n\nEither if we care about it or not we can't deny that society is highly driven by money, status, aesthetics and so. Values, that are things related to the power of influence. The influence to create and the influence of attracting people persuaded to collaborate with us for our creation. Collaboration that others offer as exchange of some of the access to such values, which once acquired enough gives them the power to create and influence.  \n\n\nWe know about people who have the believe that human interaction have only one meaning, and that would be money (which all other values are related to). In this particular perspective, money is what defines you. Your abilities, your brightness, your position in society, your level of access to goods and services and your level of creative power. There is a truth in it, not for natural reasons but for cultural reasons. The only way to survive with an healthy and integrated life balance in today society is through acquiring money (which ironically, the stress and worries related to money often scorn our health and \u00a0life balance). The amount of money needed will depend on the values and views of those around you I suppose.  \n\n\nWhat I disagree in this view is about money being the means of every human relation. It's the meaning for social integration at certain level but not the meaning of human interaction. Humans, as any alive organism, strive for survival and according to [Antonio Damasio](https://www.antoniodamasio.com/) such survival is measured by the organism balance. We have the perception of balance through emotion (visible or invisible somatic action and movements in reaction to something that provoked them), meaning that we perceive what causes us joy or irritability (and anything in between) and react according to it. In short, we build emotional defenses against what causes us distress and emotional attachment to what cause us joy in order to maintain a balance for life preservation and perpetuation. Simple living organisms such as insects, mono-cellular and even bacteria don't have consciousness of their emotions (which is not the same as feelings). Only animals who have feelings (mental images) can feel what they emote, which require a more developed nervous system. As Antonio Damasio simplify in a short quote, *\"emotions play in the theater of the body. Feelings play in the theater of the mind\".*  \n\n\nWe can then conclude that the meaning of human interaction is Joy. Even if the job we work with is not joyful, we do it for the payment, normally through monetary earning. Money which bring us a joyful feeling, not because of the money itself but because of the joyful things (and people) we can obtain through it. And the most joyful thing one can have is to contemplate oneself as the cause of joy of others according to Lordon.  \n\n\n*\"Since this \\[joy\\] is renewed as man considers his virtues, or his power of acting, everyone is anxious to tell his own deeds, and show off his powers, both of body and mind.\"* \\-\u00a0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lordon,\u00a0[Willing Slaves of Capital: Spinoza and Marx on Desire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18112211-willing-slaves-of-capital).  \n\n\nDuring my early adulthood I was often taking the buses in front of the building I used to live. As normally, at least for me, I had always been ignored. Not disrespected but ignored. At least until I started attending a flight attendant course that imposed on me the demand of a very formal looking and behavior. When I left home for the first time wearing suit and tie, in a such elegant and status symbol outfit,\u00a0was when I noticed I had people attention, servitude and privileged treatment. Bus drivers welcoming with \"good morning sir\", shop attendants looking forwards to serve me first and women who usually would avoid contact and interaction with me were now smiley and approachable. I was the same poor guy as before only that I was in a fancy clothes going to, and returning from, a fancy neighborhood. The talk about the social prejudice in Brazilian society back then was still a kind of taboo among many people (despite today's obviousness), but it was a clear fact I deduced from my experience. Such experience made me feel good about myself, but I could not just ignore the fact that people was treating me based on a believe they have about me that wasn't true, based on my clothes symbolism. A believe on my power of acting, my power of causing others joy, biological and social harmony satisfaction, which they wish to acquire through me.  \n\n\nIn 2008 I arrived in Ireland where I met great photographers and models who, thanks to them, I could learn from, build my portfolio with and get some jobs as photographer through. Over all, excluding some exceptions, we were not looking for money or status in a direct way but have fun, have joy. Models, makeup artists and photographers\u00a0among other creators\u00a0were happy to be part of projects for the creativity and joy sake, that consequently helped us in further opportunities in our respective industries. Enjoying and respecting each other work without snobbish attitude, aloofness or competition about who has the privilege to be the joy provider to others but agreeing that we share joy among us, making we all feeling in harmony working with each other, a biological (consequently emotional) and social harmony balance, all offering and acquiring the power of acting from each other, without the monetary gate keeping. Money? it always could be negotiated according to what we could afford. I was paying my bills working in a convenience store which was fine. My time in Ireland was the most joyful and prolific in my life, all that required little money but only trust. I found models searching among university students and I met many people through street photography.  \n\n\nMoney is the value that gives us the power of acting, but we must not forget that the monetary value is not in the money itself but in the power of creation, of acting. This is the joy we are after and to truly obtain such joy it requires trust. Otherwise, the joy of monetary power monopoly\u00a0creates envy and segregation, consequently social stress. [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger) says that the happiness of being envied is called glamour.  \n\n\n\"Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance. It depends precisely upon *not sharing your experience with those who envy you.* You are observed with interest but you do not observe with interest - if you do, you will become less enviable. In this respect the envied are like bureaucrats; the more impersonal they are, the greater the illusion (for themselves and for others) of their power. The power of the glamorous resides in their supposed happiness: the power of the bureaucrat in his supposed authority.\u201d\u00a0\u2015\u00a0John Berger,\u00a0[Ways of Seeing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing)  \n\n\nI arrived in Germany with the expectation to continuous the photography life style I had in Ireland but I was wrong about it. Making contacts became rare, everybody is looking for money even though they don't need it. Being able to offer joy through my work became not enough, because people are not interested in sharing joy but in monopolize it through monetary status, using the money status as gate keeping, as trust symbol. Even among models and creators who look for no payment collaborative work, they often are looking for photographers who show to have fancy tools, a dedicated studio in a fix address. It doesn't matter to them the result and the joy of the activity unless it can be provided through monetary status, as the access to a monopolized joy which they can justify their aloofness and segregation.  \n\n\nIt also results on a social fear, a distrust on people who look for joy sharing without segregation, suspicious of them as if they have second intentions, the intention to steal something from you maintained through\u00a0the monetary gate keeping. Them seen as segregated\u00a0from the privilege of your monopolistic joy, the ones who lack acting power and consequently have not much to provide as a joy, therefore desperate to take it from you.  \n\n\nModels and photographers seem to compete on their self importance, on who is the joy provider to the other, instead of enjoying it as a joy exchange though helping each other for a same result goal. People are not approachable because of the distrust that strangers\u00a0attempt of interaction has either monetary or sexual (joyful) goal or is a mad person. The other human interaction attempt can only be about dubious intention of climbing and preserve the intrinsic joy of being the joy provider in a monopolistic status kept through monetary (and sexual) border.  \n\n\nI think the key is empathy and understanding of what really matters, what we are striving\u00a0for. We are striving\u00a0for balance that comes with joy. Through such understanding I suppose we can learn the importance of trust and honesty required for us to be able to enjoy life and society together.

I found models searching among university students and I met many people through street photography.  \n\n\nMoney is the value that gives us the power of acting, but we must not forget that the monetary value is not in the money itself but in the power of creation, of acting. This is the joy we are after and to truly obtain such joy it requires trust. Otherwise, the joy of monetary power monopoly\u00a0creates envy and segregation, consequently social stress. [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger) says that the happiness of being envied is called glamour.  \n\n\n\"Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance. It depends precisely upon *not sharing your experience with those who envy you.* You are observed with interest but you do not observe with interest - if you do, you will become less enviable. In this respect the envied are like bureaucrats; the more impersonal they are, the greater the illusion (for themselves and for others) of their power. The power of the glamorous resides in their supposed happiness: the power of the bureaucrat in his supposed authority.\u201d\u00a0\u2015\u00a0John Berger,\u00a0[Ways of Seeing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing)  \n\n\nI arrived in Germany with the expectation to continuous the photography life style I had in Ireland but I was wrong about it. Making contacts became rare, everybody is looking for money even though they don't need it. Being able to offer joy through my work became not enough, because people are not interested in sharing joy but in monopolize it through monetary status, using the money status as gate keeping, as trust symbol. Even among models and creators who look for no payment collaborative work, they often are looking for photographers who show to have fancy tools, a dedicated studio in a fix address. It doesn't matter to them the result and the joy of the activity unless it can be provided through monetary status, as the access to a monopolized joy which they can justify their aloofness and segregation.  \n\n\nIt also results on a social fear, a distrust on people who look for joy sharing without segregation, suspicious of them as if they have second intentions, the intention to steal something from you maintained through\u00a0the monetary gate keeping. Them seen as segregated\u00a0from the privilege of your monopolistic joy, the ones who lack acting power and consequently have not much to provide as a joy, therefore desperate to take it from you.  \n\n\nModels and photographers seem to compete on their self importance, on who is the joy provider to the other, instead of enjoying it as a joy exchange though helping each other for a same result goal. People are not approachable because of the distrust that strangers\u00a0attempt of interaction has either monetary or sexual (joyful) goal or is a mad person. The other human interaction attempt can only be about dubious intention of climbing and preserve the intrinsic joy of being the joy provider in a monopolistic status kept through monetary (and sexual) border.  \n\n\nI think the key is empathy and understanding of what really matters, what we are striving\u00a0for. We are striving\u00a0for balance that comes with joy. Through such understanding I suppose we can learn the importance of trust and honesty required for us to be able to enjoy life and society together. Because\u00a0*Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.*\n\nhttp://www.marciofaustino.com/blog/the-economics-of-joy-or-the-strive-for-balance"}, {"autor": "stohm", "selftext": "nan", "title": "took some bangers and made a vlog could you give me some tips to improve my photos subscribe if you want to join my gurney to making a carea of photography", "num-comments": 1, "score": 1, "date": "2019-08-14 10:57:16", "content": "took so-----> me !!!  bangers and made a vlog could you give -----> me !!!  so-----> me !!!  tips to -----> improve !!!  my photos subscribe if you want to join my gurney to making a carea of photography"}, {"autor": "ritvikupadhyaya", "selftext": "TL;DR: Tell me how can I make my photos/edits better (link to insta account below)\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ritvikupadhyaya/\n\nHi everyone, I have been taking travel/landscape photos for a bit now, but to be honest I just click photos while I travel and edit the ones I like in lightroom. \n\nThere is no formal process to how I approach my shots or edits.

I am a 20 years old guy, who moved from Ukraine to Poland in order to study. \n\nWhen i was in school (in 10 class or so) i started to do journalism. I wrote some arcticles about music in my social page (and then turned out they are good), and than wrote to one journal about hip-hop and started working in it. I visited some concerts as a press. And once i went for a 7 days music event. I wanted to make some content for my journal, so i took my dad's camera (nikon d5100 kit) and rolled. I cant say how i liked making photos. I didnt feel that alive for my hole life. And i started learning things about photo. \n\nSo, as i said, after my school i left to Poland to study. I still prefered my journalism 'hobby' over photo, i thought it will be more realistic to be a good journalist than a good photography guy for me. Turned out, that i can choose 'press and photography' and i was ducking happy. I'm on my 3 year now.\n\nFor this time, i've been learning photo a lot. I know pretty much about all photography theory stuff. I worked as a photographer in a tour company. We visited Europes cities and i was taking photos of people who were with this tour comp. But it was only 1 day per week. Salary was good - almost 50$ per day (i would mention, that its pretty good for poland, here on average work u get 4$ per hour. And i worked only 2 hours while that people had an excursion). But i couldnt live on 200$/month.  \n\nAlso, i managed to do photo sessions several times, just answering people who wrote in social medias that they are searching for photographer. But it was really rare (3 or 4 times over 2 years).\n\nCurrently, Im working on an average work so i can pay my rent, bills, food etc. But i dont want to work here. I cant find a work in photo-industry either. There are ONLY TWO work ads right now. Both from gigant firms, that wont even see my portoflio in those hundreds portfolios. \n\n  \nAlso im still visiting some concerts as a photographer, but i do it for free. Just to listen some music i like and to do some shots for my portfo.    \n\n\nI want to get money and do photography, but i just cant find those tip to get into industry. In future, Im pretty sure i want to do business and open my photostudio, but i dont have enough money for now. Im pretty suffering because of it. I dont even know whether my photos are good or no. \n\nRight now im trying to win some contests. First i found Gurushots. I tried it and than understood, that 90% photos there are trash (*thats not about quality of photos - there are porn photos from someone's home archives, screenshots from movies lol, and etc*). Then i found Shuttout. This page seems leggit, but i still dont even know should i try 'paid entry' and will i have any chances to win some money with it or i'll just waste my money.\n\nI would even do someones post-production as retouching or etc, but i dont know where am i supposed to search.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is: how can i make money with photography on my level? How u rolled in this industry? What do you think about photography contests? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres my  [inst](https://www.instagram.com/kondrphotography/)  and  [500px](https://500px.com/kondrphoto)  (for high resol, tho i created it week ago, so i have only few photos there).  \n\n\nSorry for this text-wall.

I am a 20 years old guy, who moved from Ukraine to Poland in order to study. \n\nWhen i was in school (in 10 class or so) i started to do journalism. I wrote some arcticles about music in my social page (and then turned out they are good), and than wrote to one journal about hip-hop and started working in it. I visited some concerts as a press. And once i went for a 7 days music event. I wanted to make some content for my journal, so i took my dad's camera (nikon d5100 kit) and rolled. I cant say how i liked making photos. I didnt feel that alive for my hole life. And i started learning things about photo. \n\nSo, as i said, after my school i left to Poland to study. I still prefered my journalism 'hobby' over photo, i thought it will be more realistic to be a good journalist than a good photography guy for me. Turned out, that i can choose 'press and photography' and i was ducking happy. I'm on my 3 year now.\n\nFor this time, i've been learning photo a lot. I know pretty much about all photography theory stuff. I worked as a photographer in a tour company. We visited Europes cities and i was taking photos of people who were with this tour comp. But it was only 1 day per week. Salary was good - almost 50$ per day (i would mention, that its pretty good for poland, here on average work u get 4$ per hour. And i worked only 2 hours while that people had an excursion). But i couldnt live on 200$/month.  \n\nAlso, i managed to do photo sessions several times, just answering people who wrote in social medias that they are searching for photographer. But it was really rare (3 or 4 times over 2 years).\n\nCurrently, Im working on an average work so i can pay my rent, bills, food etc. But i dont want to work here. I cant find a work in photo-industry either. There are ONLY TWO work ads right now. Both from gigant firms, that wont even see my portoflio in those hundreds portfolios. \n\n  \nAlso im still visiting some concerts as a photographer, but i do it for free. Just to listen some music i like and to do some shots for my portfo.    \n\n\nI want to get money and do photography, but i just cant find those tip to get into industry. In future, Im pretty sure i want to do business and open my photostudio, but i dont have enough money for now. Im pretty suffering because of it. I dont even know whether my photos are good or no. \n\nRight now im trying to win some contests. First i found Gurushots. I tried it and than understood, that 90% photos there are trash (*thats not about quality of photos - there are porn photos from someone's home archives, screenshots from movies lol, and etc*). Then i found Shuttout. This page seems leggit, but i still dont even know should i try 'paid entry' and will i have any chances to win some money with it or i'll just waste my money.\n\nI would even do someones post-production as retouching or etc, but i dont know where am i supposed to search.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is: how can i make money with photography on my level? How u rolled in this industry? What do you think about photography contests? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres my  [-----> i !!! nst](https://www.-----> i !!! nstagram.com/kondrphotography/)  and  [500px](https://500px.com/kondrphoto)  (for h-----> i !!! gh resol, tho -----> i !!!  -----> created !!!  -----> i !!! t week ago, so -----> i !!!  have only few photos there).  \n\n\nSorry for this text-wall.

Most of my edits are based on a VSCO preset that I then tweak. But it's been a big issue since VSCO decided to stop the support of Lightroom presets and focus on their mobile app. First of all the new cameras are not supported. For my Fujifilm X-T3, I had to modify the color profile file and change the old camera name with my new one. It worked, for now.\n\nBut the main issue with all of that is that it means that my work is not future-proof. If I need to go back to a previous catalog looking for a picture with a VSCO edit, there is a chance that it may not work with the next version of Lightroom. So there is chance that this specific edit will no longer work and that I will not be able to recover my picture correctly. The other issue is that some VSCO presets are really what I'm looking for in term of color grading and I have difficulties to get the same result without it. And it's because it's their Lightroom Color Profile that do most of  the work and it seems not possible to copy.\n\nSo I tried to think about what are my options. And what seems to be the obvious one was to try to export a LUT from a VSCO preset. If it worked, it would have meant that I could use that LUT in Lightroom and in other photography softwares as well or even editing, compositing softwares like Premiere Pro or Nuke. The LUT files as .cube are quite solid options to me.\n\nI found a LUT generator that I can use on Lightroom thanks to  [https://generator.iwltbap.com/](https://generator.iwltbap.com/) . With this tool, I just have to create a HALD file (basically a file with all the specter of colors). I import this file (this is a .png file) in Lightroom, I apply the edit I want to export as LUT to the HALD file. And I export this edited file. Then the LUT generator will just look at this file, see the differences between it and the reference, and then create a LUT file with these informations in it. After that I just have to load that LUT into Camera Raw (can't do that in Lr) and export it as a Color Profile.\n\nThe workflow to have a LUT from an edit in Lightroom is quite easy. But my main issue is that, while you can synchronize your parameters from a RAW file to the .png HALD file, ***it won't apply the color profile.*** Because it seems that the color profile can only be applied to raw files from cameras. I tried to fake this .png HALD file by adding cameras metadatas, or to export it as .DNG file via the Adobe DNG Converter tool. But nothing worked.\n\nBy the way, I also have this issue when I need to make a modification of a picture in Photoshop like a restore of an element. When saved from Photoshop, it saves as a tiff, And when you come back to Lightroom, you have your picture modified but the color profile won't apply because it's not a raw anymore. And I obviously prefer to make my Photoshop restore on the unedited file, in case I do modify my color grading after that. \n\nSo if you have any idea on how to apply a color profile on a file that is not a RAW, or not coming from a camera. If you have a workflow to make these VSCO presets future-proof and which can be re-exported for your own. If you know how to export a preset as a LUT ***with*** having ALL the edits (color profile included) with it. Well, it would be ***much much*** appreciated. \n\nI hope that my issue wasn't too much to absorb and that some of you will have the same interest in the mater. Because overall it's mostly about making your work usable in the future and avoid obsolescence. \n\nThank you all for your patience,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValentin", "title": "VSCO obsolescence and solutions to keep it future-proof", "num-comments": 1, "score": 1, "date": "2019-11-08 21:46:30", "content": "VSCO obsolescence and solutions to keep it future-proof /!/ Hi guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need some advice about a workflow to keep VSCO presets usable and/or export LUTS ***with*** color profiles. \n\nI use a lot VSCO presets, and since several years now.

When you had the image in your head, you just need to access the website and create!

I am an amateur photographer who is very interested in the field and even though it is not my day job, I'm quite serious about photography and don't consider it as something I do just for fun.\n\nSo a few days back I met another photographer because he shares a second common hobby with me different from photography.  We were discussing photography and he told me that he spends a lot of time and money on photo shoots because he likes doing this. I asked him for his Instagram and he said that he didn't use social media since he didn't like it for similar reasons that I find many photographers disliking it i.e competitive culture, people posting just for likes, square grid, aspect ratio, fame war etc.\n\nLater though he asked me what I think he should do with his work because sometimes he questions why he is creating it? Although he had the answer and it was, for himself.\n\nThis made me think a bit and as someone who uses Instagram a lot to share my work, I am sometimes surprised when I see people, especially Photographers, disliking Instagram or social media. I feel that Instagram is a boon for photographers. I couldn't imagine what I would do with my work if I didn't know that there would be people who would be looking at it and appreciating or disliking it. But I think the answer doesn't finish there.\n\nI see people sometimes posting here about how Photographers have it hard these days because anyone can take pics with an iPhone camera and Photographers are a dime a dozen. And how Photographer's average salaries are reducing, I am not sure about this one, I read something like this here. But then I also see them hating Instagram which may help them showcase their work, maybe find work, clients, fans, inspiration and make money potentially by a job, sponsorship etc. (Know easier said than done)\n\nMy take on this is that when it comes to these fields, with time a necessary need has arisen to not only be good at the field or at least above average but also be marketable and think like a business person. But this is nothing that Instagram is to blame for. This cult is just a result of technological advancement. I will give an example. About 2 decades back the Singers in my country, for the most part, were people with very average or even below-average looks. Obviously, there were outliers but that trend has changed a lot now. With autotune, and the plethora of technological advancement in the field, a person with a less beautiful voice would be more popular because he/she is better looking and more marketable. Almost every singer these days is a good looking person here.\n\nI think this may also apply to Photography. There are phones and apps that come with them which enable people to take good photos and edit them to a point which may hide a lot of their photography skills. But does this mean that there is no place for good photographers? Of course not, but you will have to play the game. If you try to go against the flow you are only going to only hurt yourself. This reminds of the character Walter White from Breaking Bad, who after he has a feud with the co-founders of a business quits it thinking that he is much better than them (and he actually was) and they'd be screwed without him but that business later turns into a billion-dollar business. This takes a toll on him and he starts doing a very low paying low-stress job to cope with that fact, maybe he was trying to make himself believe that all this money doesn't matter and he will live a simple life. But it is only when one day he realizes he has cancer he decides that he needs to achieve something in life before he dies.\n\nThis brings me back to my friend. I think my friend is doing just that. His work may be appreciated on social media and Instagram and can help him find others interested in it or interested in working with him but he isn't using it because he thinks it is a waste, probably because he hasn't been successful on it or for some other reason. I didn't suggest him because that may have been rude or he might not have taken that well, but why would he not use social media to showcase his work with others especially when he spends a lot of money on it? There is something that exists that can let you share your work with others so easily and you are not doing it simply because there are some others over there who are using it just to get likes? Or because you need to crop your pics? And then you say what do I do with my work? \n\n\nI think people need to adapt to changing times and realize the fact that technology and development have made a lot of impact on how to survive in these fields but that doesn't mean you can't do that.  This also brings me to a very popular person, Peter McKinnon. I know some people will dislike the name, some will like it but the guy is doing what needs to be done in today's age to make the most out of it. Or even [Sean Tucker](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0JFdo7HS3-/) another popular YouTuber and photographer who asks you to [be yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L_tbm5HTU) and focuses so much on being authentic and is not as lively and extroverted as PM yet posts every day on Instagram. These guys realize that these tools and platforms are not something that you start hating because few are using it the wrong way. Instead, they share their work and try to make the most out of it. And it worked well for them. Not saying everyone can get that big but realizing the need to adapt to changing times will definitely help others imo.", "title": "Instagram, is it a boon or curse for Photographers?

This reminds of the character Walter White from Breaking Bad, who after he has a feud with the co-founders of a business quits it thinking that he is much better than them (and he actually was) and they'd be screwed without him but that business later turns into a billion-dollar business. This takes a toll on him and he starts doing a very low paying low-stress job to cope with that fact, maybe he was trying to make himself believe that all this money doesn't matter and he will live a simple life. But it is only when one day he realizes he has cancer he decides that he needs to achieve something in life before he dies.\n\nThis brings me back to my friend. I think my friend is doing just that. His work may be appreciated on social media and Instagram and can help him find others interested in it or interested in working with him but he isn't using it because he thinks it is a waste, probably because he hasn't been successful on it or for some other reason. I didn't suggest him because that may have been rude or he might not have taken that well, but why would he not use social media to showcase his work with others especially when he spends a lot of money on it? There is something that exists that can let you share your work with others so easily and you are not doing it simply because there are some others over there who are using it just to get likes? Or because you need to crop your pics? And then you say what do I do with my work? \n\n\nI think people need to adapt to changing times and realize the fact that technology and development have made a lot of impact on how to survive in these fields but that doesn't mean you can't do that.  This also brings me to a very popular person, Peter McKinnon. I know some people will dislike the name, some will like it but the guy is doing what needs to be done in today's age to make the most out of it. Or even [Sean Tucker](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0JFdo7HS3-/) another popular YouTuber and photographer who asks you to [be yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L_tbm5HTU) and focuses so much on being authentic and is not as lively and extroverted as PM yet posts every day on Instagram. These guys realize that these tools and platforms are not something that you start hating because few are using it the wrong way. Instead, they share their work and try to make the most out of it. And it worked well for them. Not saying everyone can get that big but realizing the need to adapt to changing times will definitely help others imo."}, {"autor": "jackbmerton", "selftext": "Hello!

Rather, I would love to start a discussion, talk about how it relates to the work of professional photographers, to my own journey, and see if other people can also identify with it.\n\nThe article talks about reasons why smart, hard-working people fail to succeed, and the final three stood out to me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*1. Changing direction based on whatever feels most exciting at the moment.*\n\nThis is a very difficult one to not do. You want to create a look that fits your current mood. Since your mood changes, and so does your creative vision, in a way, it is difficult to be consistent.\n\nProfessional photographers usually are very consistent in what they do. And I don't mean just picking a subject matter -- it goes far beyond that. If you do landscapes, are you doing big vistas or singled out distant objects? Do you do mountains, oceans, or forests? It's often very focused. Ie, Max Rive is known for images of a small person in big mountain vistas. Simon Baxter is focused entirely on woodland.\n\nThe processing style is also a big part of it. Simon Baxter, for example, does minimal and soft processing.  If you saw a very saturated image in his portfolio or instagram grid, you would be very turned off by it. It would ruin the vibe entirely. A natural image in Max Rive's portfolio, however, might look underwhelming.\n\nThe biggest thing is that a portfolio that is a mix of Max Rive and Simon Baxter would not make sense at all, and they would not be able to do this professionally if they tried that. I guess Max Peter Iversen is an example of someone who experiments in both mountains and woodland, though he still has a somewhat consistent style across the two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*2. Inability to commit to a decision.*\n\nThis sort of goes hand in hand with the above. There are so many decisions to be made, both in finding the subject matter, composition, and in processing the image. Interestingly, many well known photographers seem to have had a consistent style for years. Looking at Daniel Kordan's gallery, the images from 2009 are not that different from the images in 2019. The newer ones are often better composed, and sometimes slightly more punchy, but the overall look is the same -- soft and natural, with fairly saturated tones. He committed to a style early on.\n\nHe could have gone back and re-processed every one of his old images, which is possible. But, I see the same from other photographers. Dylan Furst's images posted on 500px in the early stages of his career are a similar style to images he's posting now.\n\nBoth photographers have gotten better, of course, but they picked a direction and committed to it early on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*3. Not believing in yourself.*\n\nI think that this is connected to the above. If you believe in yourself, you might be more likely to figure out what your personal vision is, ignore irrelevant information, and not question yourself when you encounter beautiful work in a different style.\n\nThis happened to me many times. Over the years it's become easier to say \"That is beautiful, but not something I want to emulate,\" to more and more styles I see out there. Still, as a result of being unable to pick a direction, commit to it and go all in, I feel like my work has not been nearly as consistent as I would like. If you take a look at my instagram (yuriygarnaev), you will see what I mean to an extent. I don't want this to seem like self-promotion, more to provide an example. Some images are black and white, some have a film-like look, some with intense colors and some fairly natural.\n\nBiggest issue with this, besides an inconsistent portfolio, is that you end up spending a lot of time trying out a million styles, and being overwhelmed with decisions, when instead you could be spending half an hour per image and producing a lot more consistent, high quality pieces of work. And, instead you could be focusing your energy on getting out there and taking more images. Ultimately that is what will help you develop strong composition skills in a your subject area, which I think is one of the most crucial ingredients.\n\nOne might say that failure is subjective. If someone enjoys experimenting with many different things, this might not be failure to them. To me, success would mean producing a cohesive body of work that one might imagine in a book or a gallery, that elicits a specific set of feelings or emotions. I imagine this is the goal of many others, and this is what most people we admire have achieved. Of course, it's possible to experiment a great deal, but only share work that fits your portfolio.

But I would like to make a little money here and there to offset the cost of the hobby some. I do some woodworking and plan on selling some things here and there as well to help justify the tools. Unlike woodworking, I don't know where to begin in photography. I would love to sell some prints, but wouldn't know where to sell them. Or just sell images for stock photos. I would be open to doing a low pressure event, like a birthday party or public event where there are other pros working as well, but don't want any high pressure work where people are depending on me to get \"the shot.\" \n\nI have been taking photography somewhat seriously as a hobby for about 2 years and have gotten much better. I have some shots that I (and others) have really loved. I am getting a better eye for composition and can more easily identify a good candid shot. -----> I !!!  am working on -----> improving !!!  landscape and wildlife photography as those seem much different (landscape takes a lot of planning and wildlife takes luck, skill, and planning all rolled into one). I know none of my shots are amazing, but I am decent (I think).\n\nWhat would you all who make money off their photography suggest? I started a website just for the hell of it, not really caring if anyone sees it. www.dennyphoto.com. That would give a good idea of my skill, or lack thereof. I am not looking to get roasted, but constructive criticism is welcome. Again, I really enjoy doing this for my own pleasure.

As we enter a new generation of gaming, we see a future where you\u2019re instantly absorbed in your games \u2013 where worlds are even more lifelike, immersive, responsive and surprising \u2013 and where you are at the center of your gaming experience. With the new Xbox Series X, we will realize that vision.\u00a0\n\nXbox Series X will be our fastest, most powerful console ever and set a new bar for performance, speed, and compatibility, allowing you to bring your gaming legacy, thousands of games from three generations and more forward with you. Its industrial design enables us to deliver four times the processing power of Xbox One X in the quietest and efficient way, something that is critically important in delivering truly immersive gameplay. We also designed Xbox Series X to support both vertical and horizontal orientation. It\u2019s bold and unique, very much like our fans around the world and the team of collaborators and innovators who built it.\n\nThe name Xbox is an expression of our deep history in gaming, our team\u2019s unrelenting passion, and our commitment to both our fans and the future of gaming at Microsoft. It also signifies our belief that a gaming console should be for just that \u2013 gaming.\n\nAlongside Xbox Series X, we also unveiled the new Xbox Wireless Controller. Its size and shape have been refined to accommodate an even wider range of people, and it also features a new Share button to make capturing screenshots and game clips simple and a hybrid d-pad inspired by the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2. The new Xbox Wireless Controller will be compatible with Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs, and will be included with every Xbox Series X.\n\nThe possibilities of what Xbox Series X enables developers to achieve was also brought to life this evening with the unveiling of\u00a0_Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade II_. A sequel to the award-winning\u00a0_Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice_\u00a0from world-renowned developers Ninja Theory, the game is being built to leverage the full power of Xbox Series X.\u00a0 The footage shared tonight was captured in-engine and reflects the power of Xbox Series X available to developers to deliver new universes, experiences and games in ways you have never imagined.\n\n### **Bringing Developers\u2019 Dreams to Life with Xbox Series X**\n\nGames today deliver amazing visuals and tell an array of different and deep stories.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, when we started work on Xbox Series X, it was vital we continue to advance state-of-the-art visual capabilities for developers, while also ensuring they could realize even greater feeling, emotion, and empathy in their games. With Xbox Series X, we will elevate the way games look, play and feel. We will also remove the technical barriers faced in previous generations and enable developers to create more expansive, immersive gaming worlds that invite more players to play.\u00a0\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, this will manifest as world-class visuals in 4K at 60FPS, with the possibility of up to 120FPS, including support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and 8K capability. Powered by our custom-designed processor leveraging the latest Zen 2 and next-generation RDNA architecture from our partners at AMD, Xbox Series X will deliver hardware-accelerated ray tracing and a new level of performance never before seen in a console. \u00a0Additionally, our patented Variable Rate Shading (VRS) technology will allow developers to get even more out of the Xbox Series X GPU and our next-generation SSD will virtually eliminate load times and bring players into their gaming worlds faster than ever before.\n\nWe are minimizing latency by leveraging technology such as Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and giving developers new functionality like Dynamic Latency Input (DLI) to make Xbox Series X the most responsive console ever.\u00a0 Xbox Series X is also designed for a future in the cloud, with unique capabilities built into the hardware and software to make it as easy as possible to bring great games to both console and elsewhere. Xbox Series X will deliver a level of fidelity and immersion, unlike anything that\u2019s been achieved in previous console generations. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n### **One Console, Four Generations of Gaming**\n\nOne of the things we\u2019re most proud of with Xbox Series X is the promise we\u2019re delivering to our fans who have and continue to invest with Xbox.

I usually shoot aperture priority. I watched probably 6 hours worth of Youtube videos and took notes before going out to practice. -----> I !!!  need to figure out how to -----> improve !!!  my images, they feel SO grainy and disappointing and -----> I !!!  almost want to cancel on shooting the concert because of how disappointed -----> I !!!  am in myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStats:\n\n35mm f1.8 lens used (I also have the kit lenses, 18-50mm and 75-100mm f5.6)\n\nShutter speed: 1/1600\n\nF1.8\n\nISO: 25600\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is how the images turned out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img yygseoay3j531...*\n\n*Processing img fgxdimuu3j531...*"}, {"autor": "Sir-FatCat", "selftext": "This may be against the promotion rule but I think It's fair to have a text post of others collected works they wish to share.", "title": "Share your blogs and online galleries here!

I personally, am primarily a film user even on social nights (analog from photo to print or on cine film in the case of motion pictures, with scanning of final prints for further sharing or to recover photos that are hard to print in the darkroom via negative scanning), though prefer digital for action photography. This is all subjective, and is in no way an authority on anything ;)\n\n# Film Advantages for me\n\nMy reasons for choosing film as a primary medium (colour and black-and-white, darkroom all the way, apart from sharing and digital softcopy as backup/recovery and use digital action photography or extreme handheld low light photography where film falls apart) despite being the age of 24 born into the 'modern' time: I primarily take photos of social nights at houses/people with a lot of candid shots, landscapes, streets, and objects as an art form to give away to people, and have done odd jobs photographing events for people. \n\nI often use black-and-white, and gelatin-silver prints are just beautiful. It gets me off the PC for a while, and I can sit in the darkroom with an audiobook or music with my phone in a light-tight bag for this purpose. A time to zone out, even when doing prints on a paid basis for someone else and can do very good quality prints and can get my hands in there. I also love playing with chemistry, this is an added bonus. Watching the print appear in the tray under red-light is magical and this cannot be reproduced in any other way, no other process will match this in beauty. \n\nI have to think before I press the shutter, which is another reason why I like the darkroom. Even with digital, I also prefer manual focus. No other way to make gelatin silver prints even from digital masters at home on the cheap, whereas enlargers are very cheap. A darkroom setup will cost far less than a high end digital printer, and will enable you to do C-Type prints or gelatin-silver prints of insane enlargements with far lower costs. Ideal if you want full control over the process.\n\nI like the fact that film is forgiving when a shoe-flash is used, and it means I will use low ISO in poor lighting and will play around with flash filters etc, highlights are often perfectly retained with very little effort with negative film, split grade printing in the darkroom brings out highlights with ease and retains detail in the shadows, and is simple, quick and intuitive to do, on a film such as Ilford FP4+ and Ilford PAN 100. An example of this is a picture on a self-timer of me and my friend perfectly framed, with the handmade chessboard with us playing. The shadows and the black pieces and the white pieces with the highlights retain all their detail with ease and very little effort. I often develop in Ilford ID11 1+1, and mostly shoot 35mm with an SLR, though I have a couple of high quality compacts. I also use T-Grain films such as Tmax.\n\nI like that fun candid moments will appear only when we develop, giving an element of surprise for the others who may wish to see it. People end up with physical prints with social evenings from me. One of my good Chinese friends had a carefully crafted photo album when he left the UK for china at the end of his time here. \n\nAs for colour, I do shoot film for colour and process E6 myself, but mostly as transparencies. Nothing beats all gathering round a slide projector, and watching as your images have insane detail on the wall/screen. As transparencies are shot as-is, you compose the shot perfectly at the time. Very little post-processing is needed, short of playing with developer pH if you are playing around with that, or tweaking scans of the transparencies. Digital scanning if you want prints made of transparencies. \n\nTransparencies however are NOT at all forgiving with almost zero latitude, so your exposure is either spot on, or done for, especially if projection is your desired result. I shoot some colour negative film as well, and print RA4 in the darkroom, though with quite a bit of colour work, especially when I need to tweak the final image a bit, I adopt a hybrid workflow, scanning negatives and printing them digitally. \n\nHP Instant Ink has pushed the cost of creating good quality colour prints of A4 size or lower down at home. Using a flash or low-light social evenings with transparencies can be suicide unless you are very well-versed, and it would be advisable to bracket. I use Provia for this purpose, for it allows me to push +1 stop in processing with virtually no quality loss, and will allow +2 stops even, giving me a 400 speed high quality transparency film, which is enough if I shoot wide open. The discontinuation of Provia 400X was a loss, for this could give very good slides at 800 speed.\n\nWith big paper rolls, you can do it for as little as 4 pence a sheet, only your time and sanity calibrating colour filtration are needed. Hand-made RA4 prints in trays are satisfying. You can use a very dim orange safelight with a 7 1/2 watt bulb for colour papers or a calibrated lamp at 590nm wavelength at a distance, so your not in total darkness for colour prints. I also have a LED torch at similar wavelength.\n\nPaper cost is cheap, especially if you grab lots of 'partially used' paper boxes from people abandoning darkrooms or who have excess. Recently grabbed over 1000 sheets of different sizes for \u00a350. Chemistry is cheap, even ensuring all my fixer is only used for one session and replaced. \n\nI press the shutter, and it will fire instantly if it is armed, no quirks, no menus, no dying batteries from leaving a camera on constantly throughout the night. I can often focus from memory with little problems, and with a flash and a high F stop always gives me the focus I need and i will keep it set at an approximated setting if I think people are about to do something stupid. I find the lack of ANY delay whatsoever has given me candid moments that I may have missed otherwise, including a friend falling through a chair with her eyes crossed that happened so suddenly. The very act of turning a DSLR on or your phone app opening will often make you miss such a moment.\n\nSome digital cameras can be set this way, but I like the simplicity of leaving an armed camera within reach with no battery drain, and as such often carry a disposable on nights out to leave lying around and take many candid shots on my SLR. This quality enabled my friend to make me jump while carrying tea, and get the moment in perfect action with the water coming out of the cup (taken on a good quality disposable). Would not have been possible to hold a DSLR up without giving away what he was going to do. And 8x10 enlargement with good enough detail was possible.\n\nEquipment lifespan. Still am able to use the same film SLR as I was in 2010 when I first got into film.\n\nNegatives will always be view able, I suspect long before raw digital file formats of today become hard to open. I treat a negative as I would a digital raw file. It was my love for film that meant all my digital work is shot in raw, no questions asked, though for me to tweak the process. It has also made me careful even with a DSLR and I will seldom fill a card unless I am doing 4K video.\n\n# Film Disadvantages for me\n\nPointless for action photography when you try and take many. Reloading film during action will cause you to miss the action, 36 exposures (35mm) is not enough for an action session. A memory card can hold way more than that The high ISOs with high shutter speeds needed if in lower light will result in far lower quality on film unless you have good lighting, as film above ISO 400 - 800 can be very grainy and can look very nice if developed properly with a look you want, but unless your using medium format or large format will fall apart if you try and make big enlargements of such a film. The loss of Provia 400X was a blow here when it was discontinued. I am glad kodak bought back TMax 3200 however, for this was very good in poor light for 12x16 enlargements and may have me revisit film for this purpose.\n\nLow light performance of digital in terms of raw quality will outstrip film, and will probably run rings around it if you do not wish to use a flash. Trying to shoot an ISO 3200 film with the lens stopped all the way open and trying to focus a gathering with a very narrow depth of field is like walking on a tightrope, though is perfectly doable, and I have done it. A decent DSLR could give you better quality and an extra stop or two of speed if you require it.\n\nDust, dust, dust. Trying to get dust off a negative while printing it. A single tiny hair you did not see while preparing the print? Time to make a new one. I use a condenser enlarger, further compounding this problem. This is probably for me the biggest gripe. Digital is less stressful in this regard. And sometimes, my sanity can be tested. I now run an air purifier and ensure darkrooms are kept as clean as possible, but still... trying to remove dust from your negative is a nighmare straight from the depths of hell. Black-and-White films (apart from C41 ones) cannot make use of digital ICE due to the silver content when scanning, though you can correct for this in photoshop.\n\nNegatives are fragile. You must care for them and handle them with care if you want to make more gelatin silver prints. Digital media is far more robust. Use digital for backup high-resolution scans, always. I keep all mine filed, and have often had to go back to certain negatives more than once when people want more prints for someone else.\n\nDigital is a one-time purchase for equipment and software bar paper and consumables or lab printing, and if you are not to worry about printing most of your work, is probably the way to go unless you enjoy film workflow for other reasons. My Nikon DSLR has given flawless service bar needing a new battery. Film has on-going costs, but these are not too bad if you process at home and scan at home.\n\nScanning in good quality is time consuming if you have many photos. Digital can have a more streamlined workflow, if you need to do a high quantity of good quality pictures, as you need not prepare every print once you have calibrated your print.\n\nSharing with the world, need I say more? The very act of sharing photos here is a hybrid solution even if film is used.\n\nNot as small as the smallest digital cameras if size really does matter, though a lightweight disposable can be good, but unless you want it for the candid value, your smartphone would probably do better if you have a flagship model or reasonable model.\n\nHP Instant Ink and other similar services have started to close the gap on the cost magins, though premium digital papers are still expensive. I do not use no-name or cheap digital paper, I want the print to be stable long-term so when people view memories made by me decades later, it will still look as good as the day we shot it. \n\nThe need to carry multiple cameras if you wish to shoot both colour/black-and-white at the same event. Extra weight.\n\nNo video capability on still film cameras, if you need quick access to high quality video, a DSLR will give you this option.\n\nSome film stocks can be hard to come by. A discontinuation of a favourite film stock is heartbreaking if you have not already stocked up, ebay prices will then go into the stratosphere. Provia 400X was one such example, and I am resigned to the fact Fuji will discontinue Provia 100F, which is my favourite for colour work due to my liking of transparencies. My freezer has quite a bit of it. \n\nDifficult to find people who understand a darkroom process and digital post may be more time efficient depending on the skill of the operator, thus for most professional work unless you want your own darkroom, digital is the way to go.\n\n# Summary\n\nFilm being my favourite, I have room for both Digital and Film in my work. Both can be fun in their own way, depending on the workflow you want. As being sat in front of screen is not something I enjoy too much for long hours, especially as I do a lot of writing and thus spend a lot of time in front of a screen, I like the darkroom as a getaway from that.\n\nDigital has advantages mentioned above that film cannot compete with in my opinion, though to be both are simply tools in your box that you may use as you wish, and other experiences may differ from mine. As silver gelatin prints, and project able transparencies are often my end goal, film therefore suits me. Projectable colour cine film is also a fun addition.\n\nA digital softcopy/backup is essential for your good work, regardless if you wish to share it or not. I often scan my prints over my negatives, as I have to do very little correction.\n\nJust had too much time on my hands today!\n\nSo what do you prefer guys, and why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "title": "Photographers of Reddit, Do you prefer Digital, Film/Darkroom or Hybrid for your workflow?

This should give you clean ISO up to 1600, and roughly 16 megapixels.  \n\\+ On these crop cameras, you can get the rough equivalents of a 28mm f2.8, 50mm f2, and 85mm f2 for 200-500 each.\n\n\\+ So that kit is \\~ 300 + 400 + 400 + 400 = $1500.\n\n\\+ You can likely buy a similar film kit (with some modern features but no autofocus) for $300.\n\n\\+ The cost of buying film and developing is estimated to be 50-60 cents/shot (rough estimate!).  \n\\+ Therefore film is less expensive if you take less than 2400 pictures.  \n\n\nAdvantages of film: 2-3 stops of dynamic range (not insignificant!), one stop of depth of field. I know there is an advantage with full frame digital over APS-C w.r.t sensor noise, but I'm not sure that applies to film. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think film results in more thoughtful photographs and is a cheaper entry point to very good quality, which matters in experienced hands. But for everyone else, and especially newcomers, the ability to take a lot of bad pictures to experiment with settings is necessary to learn the craft. When I got my first flash, I likely took 50-100 test shots to learn how the interaction between shutter speed, exposure compensation, and aperture effect the look of the flash in different environments. This would have been expensive with film, and even worse, taken a lot longer than one evening!

This should give you clean ISO up to 1600, and roughly 16 megapixels.  \n\\+ On these crop cameras, you can get the rough equivalents of a 28mm f2.8, 50mm f2, and 85mm f2 for 200-500 each.\n\n\\+ So that kit is \\~ 300 + 400 + 400 + 400 = $1500.\n\n\\+ You can likely buy a similar film kit (with some modern features but no autofocus) for $300.\n\n\\+ The cost of buying film and developing is estimated to be 50-60 cents/shot (rough estimate!).  \n\\+ Therefore film is less expensive if you take less than 2400 pictures.  \n\n\nAdvantages of film: 2-3 stops of dynamic range (not insignificant!), one stop of depth of field. I know there is an advantage with full frame digital over APS-C w.r.t sensor noise, but I'm not sure that applies to film. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think film results in more thoughtful photographs and is a cheaper entry point to very good quality, which matters in experienced hands. But for everyone else, and especially newcomers, the ability to take a lot of bad pictures to experiment with settings is necessary to learn the craft. When I got my first flash, I likely took 50-100 test shots to learn how the interaction between shutter speed, exposure compensation, and aperture effect the look of the flash in different environments.

Static pics are fine, but moving are not where I want them to be. I am shooting with 5DMarkIV, this time I tried 70-300mm F4-5.6. Is the lens a bit too dark for indoors? I have 1.8, but that's a 50mm which is pretty annoying in such events as no zoom is available.

For me, I find having the final image in my mind's eye before I've even taken the shot to be the best practice, at least for my style of shooting and later, processing.\n\nIn some cases even, the camera's metering system will be fooled when you're face with strong backlighting or awkward white balance, so RAW processing is paramount.\n\nIf a shot looks like it might be too far gone, too underexposed, and you've shot in RAW, don't fret, because the chances are that you'll be able to salvage the photo just fine later.

So essentially it will be a body + lens upgrade. But I was not prepared to see the quality of files that I managed to get.\nSimply put, as I shot mostly portraits, I was able to get the shots I liked with way less effort I used to put on D7K. And this was not an exaggeration. The neglected 50mm suddenly became a thing of beauty. The 35DX was surprisingly sharp and crisp with acceptable vignetting (which I prefer for portraits). But the true revelation was the 85 1.4. It is the ultimate combination with full frame for portraits.\n\nDynamic Range:\nComing from D7000 it is not a day and night difference, but I can clearly see D800 holding up incredibly well for pushes in post processing. I have pretty much switched over to darktable/Gimp with D800 and I manage to get a lot better colors compared to D7000. \n\nColor, Sharpness and Tonality:\nI sometimes shoot jpeg small at 9MP and the images are sharp and crisp compared to my D7K raws.

This is the single most important advantage I relish with the upgrade.\n\nSo do I recommend an upgrade to full frame for anyone shooting DX ?\nI know this might sound a bit clich\u00e9 but if you have to ask, you should not upgrade. Sometime about a couple of years ago, I took a photo in low light which I was both proud of and knew I would have gotten better if I had a full frame.

It costs lesser than a D7500 or even D7200 (though new vs used). Have a go and give yourself a treat. What if you prefer to buy only new? I suggest just wait. The age of sub $1000 full frame cameras are already here and it will only get better in the short term before bouncing away.

In my work I mostly concern with the relationship between humans and their environment, be it social, urban, political or natural. Sometimes I'm interested in small details and tiny moments of interaction, sometimes it's interesting to test out the very biggest contexts that art can embrace.\n\nIt's crazy to think how far we have pushed globalization and how far it has pushed us. And it's even more crazy to think about how there still seem to be boundaries and fences keeping us from actually working together and creating a world that is more just and fair for everyone.\n\nThe idea that I put in the title is a new project that I just started working on, and as so often Reddit makes for a good starting point, just to get some input, figure out what possible problems and chances could be. And that from people around the world!\n\nSo, let's go: The idea is that 24 different photographers living or working in 24 different timezones take a photo of the sunset at roughly the same time (in their respective timezone). This would result in a more or less full documentation of one sunset during 24 hours. The challenge is not a photographic one, it is one that concerns organization.

In my work I mostly concern with the relationship between humans and their environment, be it social, urban, political or natural. Sometimes I'm interested in small details and tiny moments of interaction, sometimes it's interesting to test out the very biggest contexts that art can embrace.\n\nIt's crazy to think how far we have pushed globalization and how far it has pushed us. And it's even more crazy to think about how there still seem to be boundaries and fences keeping -----> us !!!  from actually working together and -----> creating !!!  a world that is more j-----> us !!! t and fair for everyone.\n\nThe idea that I put in the title is a new project that I just started working on, and as so often Reddit makes for a good starting point, just to get some input, figure out what possible problems and chances could be. And that from people around the world!\n\nSo, let's go: The idea is that 24 different photographers living or working in 24 different timezones take a photo of the sunset at roughly the same time (in their respective timezone). This would result in a more or less full documentation of one sunset during 24 hours. The challenge is not a photographic one, it is one that concerns organization. People have to be found, coordinated, organized. Pictures have to be collected and edited. 24 different cultures coming together is never easy, but always interesting!\n\nI don't know where to start with this, that's why I'm calling for my brothers and sisters on reddit for inputs.

I also enjoy watching YouTube videos, tinkering, taking apart everything and after rebuilding them ( not always successful but, hey, look at the bright side- I get a lot of spear parts). \n\n Note: English is not my first language so, please, be kind with my mistakes. Feel free to point my mistakes in this  matter. \n\n But enough about me for now...  \n\n   The project Shutterstockjourney.com\n\n Not long ago, in November 2018, I got in the recommended section of YouTube a video about photography, how to become a better photographer, light, about stock photos, how to get your work, your passion into the world so I said \"hey, why not\" and that's how I stumbled upon the Shutterstock.com website after a simple Google search; I clicked and I was amazed of how many awesome photos are being taken, uploaded, the quality and that was the seed that started to grow in me.  \n\n I had to be apart of this \n\n   Iniatially I created a buyer account and I couldn't find anywhere a link to how to become a member, a contributor  ( I found out this is how we are called after a few searches) and applied with 40 or so images that I considered where my best ones and I waited for them to approve/disapprove my photos. I remember that was a very exciting period,  with many thoughts whether they will like them, if I'm good enough to do this, somehow I wanted so much to be inside, to learn and why not to get something out of this.  The answer came faster then I thought and it was a success, I was finally in YEY! I started uploading photos, doing all the keywords manually (I later found the keyword suggestion tool), titles, descriptions etc.. I remember it took me 9 hours for my first 70 photos ( English was my first stone to carry in this process). I had in total around 100 photos and I had big dreams about this, I started to read about the website, if they had a forum, if I can interact with other users; some of my questions remained to this day unanswered but baby steps, right? \n\n The website shutterstockjourney.com and my first sold picture \n\n Time passed and nothing happened, I continued to take photos, to go out when I had the chance to but somehow I had a bitter taste about this dream, I couldn't find the way to interact with other contributors (not yet), and all the learning process from the pro's resumed to the YouTube creators. Then it happened!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/pxwadohyo4d21.jpg\n\n My first sale on 11/30/2018 was a piece of perforated copper plated PCB board (I told you I like to tinker), my first $0.25!

Anyways, today 1/27/2019, I had a idea, how would be like to create a website/blog where I can write about this journey, about my feelings, photos, moments around them, interact with people that share my story.

I also enjoy watching YouTube videos, tinkering, taking apart everything and after rebuilding them ( not always successful but, hey, look at the bright side- I get a lot of spear parts). \n\n Note: English is not my first language so, please, be kind with my mistakes. Feel free to point my mistakes in this  matter. \n\n But enough about me for now...  \n\n   The project Shutterstockjourney.com\n\n Not long ago, in November 2018, I got in the recommended section of YouTube a video about photography, how to become a better photographer, light, about stock photos, how to get your work, your passion into the world so I said \"hey, why not\" and that's how I stumbled upon the Shutterstock.com website after a simple Google search; I clicked and I was amazed of how many awesome photos are being taken, uploaded, the quality and that was the seed that started to grow in me.  \n\n -----> I !!!  had to be apart of this \n\n   -----> I !!! niatially -----> I !!!  -----> created !!!  a buyer account and I couldn't find anywhere a link to how to become a member, a contributor  ( I found out this is how we are called after a few searches) and applied with 40 or so images that I considered where my best ones and I waited for them to approve/disapprove my photos. I remember that was a very exciting period,  with many thoughts whether they will like them, if I'm good enough to do this, somehow I wanted so much to be inside, to learn and why not to get something out of this.  The answer came faster then I thought and it was a success, I was finally in YEY! I started uploading photos, doing all the keywords manually (I later found the keyword suggestion tool), titles, descriptions etc.. I remember it took me 9 hours for my first 70 photos ( English was my first stone to carry in this process). I had in total around 100 photos and I had big dreams about this, I started to read about the website, if they had a forum, if I can interact with other users; some of my questions remained to this day unanswered but baby steps, right? \n\n The website shutterstockjourney.com and my first sold picture \n\n Time passed and nothing happened, I continued to take photos, to go out when I had the chance to but somehow I had a bitter taste about this dream, I couldn't find the way to interact with other contributors (not yet), and all the learning process from the pro's resumed to the YouTube creators. Then it happened!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/pxwadohyo4d21.jpg\n\n My first sale on 11/30/2018 was a piece of perforated copper plated PCB board (I told you I like to tinker), my first $0.25! After that other two sales came, to numbers (7 and 9) created from Tic Tac  mints and then it stopped; nothing happened anymore ( I continued to upload),   a lot of my photos where rejected with reasons that I couldn't understand why.

Here\u2019s why.\n\nI know these words might frustrate some\u00a0of\u00a0you,\u00a0because for photographers, investing in gear is a huge financial commitment and we all want to get it right the first time. Once we go down a path of bodies and lenses, it\u2019s difficult to switch.\n\nI\u2019ve made the decision to switch from my DSLR system to a Sony mirrorless system because I\u2019ve realized mirrorless is the future of our industry\u2014and Sony is leading the charge.\n\nIn the same vein as the evolution of life, there is also the evolution of camera equipment; it\u2019s always changing. Early on in my career, most people at National Geographic shot Nikon, the prosumer camera of choice, especially in the film days. I excitedly moved to Canon in the early 2000s as they seemed to be the frontrunner in the digital space, but I never wanted to lock into a relationship with a major camera company because I didn\u2019t want to be held to any one system. I\u2019m a journalist and an artist, and I want to shoot with the best of the best and the latest and the greatest. After all, it\u2019s really about getting the shot\u2014a shot that will live on forever. And in my case, to tell an important story that has enough impact to create change for our planet.\n\nI get dozens of emails from people every day asking me which camera I recommend, a question I haven\u2019t readily been answering. The truth is, I\u2019ve been conflicted.\n\nEven though I have been shooting Canon until recently, for the past two years, I have I found myself telling everyone to buy a Sony system. See? Conflicted. It\u2019s like telling someone to become a vegetarian while living on a carnivorous diet.\n\nCristina Mittermeier, my\u00a0partner\u00a0and co-founder of Sealegacy, has been shooting Sony for the past 12 years. I\u2019ve watched her closely in the past two years and have become deeply impressed with the rapid evolution of this powerful photography system.\n\nCristina on expedition in the Abrolhos Archipelago, making the most of her Sony gear.\n\nFor a long time, the race was for DSLR (digital single lens reflex) cameras. DSLRs use a mirror, meaning every time you hit the shutter, the mirror goes up, the camera opens the shutter, exposes the image, and then the mirror closes. And for years, that race was mostly Canon and Nikon\u2014until the introduction of mirrorless systems.\n\nWhat does mirrorless mean? No mirror flips up and then bangs shut. You know that mirror sound: the one that almost rattles your teeth and scares huge flocks of birds from the trees and sends a bear running for the forest as you hammer away at ten frames a second. I\u2019ve received countless angry glances from Cristina and other mirrorless shooters when my DSLR goes clack-clack-clack while they are quietly getting the shot at double the frame rate or nearly double the file size.\n\nWhat happens when you physically remove the mirror from a camera? With no moving parts, the camera gets faster, and it becomes silent: the two most important camera traits for a wildlife photographer.\n\nWhile other companies were devoting R&amp;D to DSLR systems, Sony quietly went about investing most of its R&amp;D in mirrorless systems. To me, it feels like the other big manufacturers are now trying to play catch-up\u2014and it could take quite some time.\n\nCombining a 42mb file while shooting at 10 frames a second on incredible quality G Master lenses while also being 100% silent makes the decision seem pretty simple. Life is about compromises, and camera equipment is no different.\n\nFinally, for the first time since I became a professional photographer, I can wholeheartedly tell the world that this is what I shoot, guilt-free.\n\nI\u2019m proud to be a Sony Artisan of Imagery; I\u2019m proud to tell everyone who asks me about what system they should get. I\u2019ve stopped being conflicted.\n\nThat said, what are my favorite camera and lens combinations? I like the [A7R3](https://sonymirrorlesspro.com/sony-a7r-iii-sport-settings/) for the file size and the speed of shooting. At 20 frames per second (fps), [the A9](https://sonymirrorlesspro.com/whats-new-in-sony-a9-firmware-5/) has its place as well. For me, 10 fps is fantastic; I will take file size over speed, mostly because I love seeing my images as massive fine art prints. But having 20 fps at my fingertips is a tremendous asset as well.\n\nFor lenses, I love the 12\u201324mm G wide-angle zoom for its range at the ultra-wide spectrum: it\u2019s a spectacular lens for underwater photography. The 16\u201335 focal length used to be my\u00a0favourite but I find that I leave it in my bag more often than not because I prefer the 12\u201324mm. The 24\u201370 f/2.8 G Master lens is great for portraits, but I can\u2019t wait to try the new 135mm G Master after hearing all the recent buzz. But my favourite lens of all is the [100\u2013400mm G Master](https://sonymirrorlesspro.com/sony-g-master-100-400mm/); it is a workhorse like no other. Finally, the new 400mm f/2.8 is incredible for low-light shooting; with teleconverters, I can shoot it at 800mm. With a 42mm MB file, I can afford to crop in even more, which really makes that lens combo about 1200mm\u2014all while keeping the 30MB equivalent.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be more excited or grateful for the journey ahead.

I understood that the reasoning why the two lens I had used on my D3400 were showing up correctly was because they were designed for crop sensor cameras.

I shoot mostly street photography but once in a while i shoot girls too. So invited this girl to a session. Most girls like my photos so they accept it pretty easily. I told her only a small percentage of the photos are usually usable and that i don't send anything unedited ever. She insisted that she wanted unedited photos but i shut her down everytime. She insisted a lot but i never accepted her requests. We still did the session. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe brought her boyfriend with her. Quite guy, didn't say much. She was liking all the photos, but in the middle of the session she started being really inquisitory, hitting me with a bunch of questions about me, the girls i shot before, why some of them didn't follow me, why i didn't have more photos, why i had one photo in my profile and then deleted it. Just a bunch of random questions about things that frankly are non of her business. I was still polite with her though she made me lose a lot of time answering all of her personal questions. We still shot a few more pictures and she was happy with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, there was never any sort of formal agreement between us about anything. I told her the photos would be for me and for her to use on our profiles, but never told her exactly how many or when i would send. She was very persistent though, always asking for the photos, always asking for unedited photos. I showed her prints of some unedited photos for her to tell me which ones she liked, and i did tell her i would send it to her when i was done editing them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important to say that we had a very relaxed way to talk to each other, that wasn't professional at all, but more \"friendly\", and we did fight a little bit over certain issues regarding the photos, but nothing major. There were a lot of misunderstandings in our communication.  But we got along fine most of times when discussing the photos. I do joke around a lot, but nothing objectively inappropriate, nothing sexual. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, she is a bit arrogant in the way she talks and is extremely demanding. Repeats the same thing over and over and over again, asks for the same thing a lot, even when i say no, and if i say no, she accuses me of not being a man of my word. Doesn't seem to understand the concept of collaboration. I'm not working for her, i'm not interested in all the photos she is interested in, so at this point i'm just editing photos to please her, since i only wanted a handful of photos and i already published them. Also, when i published one photos we had a big fight because she started being really bitchy about it, telling me i didn't ask for permission. I told i did asked her before the session if i could use the photos and she said sure. But now she is telling me \"oh, you didn't ask if you could use that one, and i don't have yet the photos that i want\". She was being bitchy more because she didn't have everything she wanted, and the new rule, created on the spot by her, was that i could only publish her photos after sending her everything she wanted. Stuff that was never agreed before between us. I asked her around 50 times if i could have the photo on my profile. She didn't answer and kept talking about how she didn't have the photos she asked for. Then finally said ok as long as i sent her the photos she wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn person she started talking about how she was afraid her photos would end up in some questionable pages, because she had to be very careful about these things since her parents are in court against each other over the divorce or whatever(she is 18). I really didn't understand her whole point but something about her started to appear a bit off to me at that point. Honestly, she striked me as an overly protected brat not willing to take a no. She is very, very, very pretty and seems to come from a rigid family. She also told me about she and her friend being invited for a session by a photographer, but then finding out he had the hidden agenda of taking more erotic photos, so they didn't accept it and went to the police. She talks a lot about courts and about going to the police and this strikes me as trouble. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago she came ask me again if X and X and X photos were ready, and i told her NO. Then i asked her if she wanted to publish them in her IG stories. At this point she already has 20 pictures, i only used 4, but hasn't posted any of them. She really seems obsessed with the pictures though. I suspect that she blocked me from seeing her IG stories and has been publishing the photos. I'm not 100% on that, but i commented with her that i was under the impression that she used to have a few story highlights on her page, and now they're gone. Also, she used to post stories everyday but i haven't seen a new story for almost a week. She replied \"Yeah, i deleted a few things and i'm thinking in deleting my ig account and creating a new one, but that's none of her business\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, given that i've been trying to be nice and give her what she wants, i didn't really like that sort of answer. And she talking about deleting accounts also makes me suspicious. Kinda seems like she is testing some sort of cop out. My only concern is she using images in a way that i don't approve of or without giving me credit for it, and something tells me that's what she was about to attempt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, at this point i just had it with her and told her: \"I think our communication ends here. Have a nive life\". She replied \"wtf\". I mean, i just don't wanna have to deal with her. I don't like her, she doesn't seem to like me and i don't wanna be giving her any more freebies. And i think that's ok. Sometimes people don't get along. And if i get a long with you, i might do something for you. If i don't, i don't have to give you a big portion of my time. I wanted to send you the photos before, but now i don't want to anyome. At this point what i wanted was a \"fine, bye\" and everything ending up ok. I go my way, she goes hers, and it's the end. She's still left with 20 pics that she loves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day i receive a message from her boyfriend, asking me to leave her alone and saying that i was inappropriate and a pig and if i didn't leave her alone and sent her the pictures he would press charges against me, and that i'm not a man of my word, and that i fooled her and promised her things i didn't deliver, etc, etc. None of this is true btw. But trying to explain it to him is like talking to a wall. He said what he wanted to say and simply didn't say much more other than \"i've said what i had to say\" and \"goodbye\". Also, talked a lot about karma. So i can't really explain anything to this person. I can't have a conversation with him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later i added them both in the same chat and sent them the unedited photos because she seems really unbalanced and i just wanted to get it over it. It wouldn't surprise me she had a mental breakdown over pictures and really tried to screw me in some way. Even if it was through lies. He replied \"thanks for keeping your promises\". I said: \"I'm not keeping my promises because i've never promised her i would send her everything she wanted, when she wanted. In fact, i said the contrary. You two are just too immature and dishonest to recognize it. I'm only sending this because i want her off my ass once and for all\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn't really reply, she blocked me right away. Maybe even reported me. I don't know.

I shoot mostly street photography but once in a while i shoot girls too. So invited this girl to a session. Most girls like my photos so they accept it pretty easily. I told her only a small percentage of the photos are usually usable and that i don't send anything unedited ever. She insisted that she wanted unedited photos but i shut her down everytime. She insisted a lot but i never accepted her requests. We still did the session. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe brought her boyfriend with her. Quite guy, didn't say much. She was liking all the photos, but in the middle of the session she started being really inquisitory, hitting me with a bunch of questions about me, the girls i shot before, why some of them didn't follow me, why i didn't have more photos, why i had one photo in my profile and then deleted it. Just a bunch of random questions about things that frankly are non of her business. I was still polite with her though she made me lose a lot of time answering all of her personal questions. We still shot a few more pictures and she was happy with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, there was never any sort of formal agreement between us about anything. I told her the photos would be for me and for her to use on our profiles, but never told her exactly how many or when i would send. She was very persistent though, always asking for the photos, always asking for unedited photos. I showed her prints of some unedited photos for her to tell me which ones she liked, and i did tell her i would send it to her when i was done editing them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important to say that we had a very relaxed way to talk to each other, that wasn't professional at all, but more \"friendly\", and we did fight a little bit over certain issues regarding the photos, but nothing major.

Although I\u2019m really pleased with the photos it creates, you must purchase each photo for $1. The panoramic photos from an iPhone are warped and don\u2019t look professional.

I'm not aspiring to do it professionally and mainly work when I have an inspiration and ideas, both of which don't come regularly. I know the basic camera settings, basic rules of composition and lighting plus about three years ago I attended a course in photography which served as a preparation for a movie school (I didn't go there in the end as it was a private school with a hefty fee and bad reputation).

Some photographers that inspire me are Dubnistkiy, Ana Dias, Haris Nukem. \n\nAfter shooting portraits for about 2 months (all outdoor shoots in my city) I feel like every shoot of mine is now getting repetitive. Repetitive in the sense that I end up having less and less variety in my pics with each shoot. I especially realized this in the last shoot when I was just standing not sure of what to do. Moreover, I feel that I am unable to come up with something unique and my pics end up looking like so many others on Instagram. I have posted my pics on other subreddits (with a different account) here and some have got a lot of appreciation so I don't think I am necessarily taking bad pics. \n\nBut I feel that I am not able to come up with something unique or develop a style.

Are you willing to get into a portrait, scenic, aerial or adventurous traveling photography? Would it be mostly pictures or videos? This has to be asked because finding the reason will definitely help in approaching your next step.\n\n**Step 2: Finding The Right Camera!**\n\nOnce your purpose is clear, you can begin exploring various DSLR cameras available in the market or online stores. Try your hands out on a few of them or visit local stores to feel the camera quality, weight and texture and satiate the new hunger a bit.\n\nHere, you must keep in mind that you shall not jump for super-expensive cameras for the sake of good pictures in one go.

Of course, here also you should keep your budget and product up-gradation in the future in mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1qfl89h0gbk31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3: Post-Processing**\n\nOnce you have got piles of capture in camera, your half-energy has to be put into assorting these images, editing or post-processing them. \n\nYes, mind you, clicking pictures is alone not done! To get one picture-perfect, you need to take 100 other images and this creates a lot of clutter in your disk or SD card space. He personally took a small advantage by [removing duplicate images](https://blogs.systweak.com/5-duplicate-photo-finder-tools-to-delete-duplicate-photos/) after which final pictures are transferred in his \u2018TO-DO\u2019 Folder. \n\nNow once this folder is ready, a huge number of tools are available online for editing that shows awesome end-results.\n\nHis favorite has been [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) for a long time which helps in healing the clicks to a great level, arrange various adjustments, sets moods &amp; colors smoothly and whatnot. All he keeps is a slight idea of what has to be done, Lightroom brings a better version of the same in the end. Whether he wishes to remove obstacles or change the sky color simply, this tool is a gift for photographers, honestly.\n\nAnd now if you wish to create graphics changes within these images, [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.photoshop.com/) is your last resort option.\n\nSo yes, you can say that if a 50% ratio goes in picture clicking, the rest of it belongs in editing them. Since both, the portions are extremely important for a beautiful output, your efforts have to be very much focused.\u201d\n\n**Finally!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0ryfgfn2gbk31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xwmgn644gbk31...*\n\nIt might look like a long process to you here, but I assure you that once you set your hands and angles perfectly, no one can stop you from getting to the core of the photography world. So pick your camera, find the inspiration, perceive around differently and capture what a naked eye is unable to see.\n\nIf he could have done this in a matter of few months, so you can!

He personally took a small advantage by [removing duplicate images](https://blogs.systweak.com/5-duplicate-photo-finder-tools-to-delete-duplicate-photos/) after which final pictures are transferred in his \u2018TO-DO\u2019 Folder. \n\nNow once this folder is ready, a huge number of tools are available online for editing that shows awesome end-results.\n\nHis favorite has been [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) for a long time which helps in healing the clicks to a great level, arrange various adjustments, sets moods &amp; colors smoothly and whatnot. All he keeps is a slight idea of what has to be done, Lightroom brings a better version of the same in the end. Whether he wishes to remove obstacles or change the sky color simply, this tool is a gift for photographers, honestly.\n\nAnd now if you wish to create graphics changes within these images, [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.photoshop.com/) is your last resort option.\n\nSo yes, you can say that if a 50% ratio goes in picture clicking, the rest of it belongs in editing them. Since both, the portions are extremely important for a beautiful output, your efforts have to be very much focused.\u201d\n\n**Finally!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0ryfgfn2gbk31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xwmgn644gbk31...*\n\nIt might look like a long process to you here, but I assure you that once you set your hands and angles perfectly, no one can stop you from getting to the core of the photography world. So pick your camera, find the inspiration, perceive around differently and capture what a naked eye is unable to see.\n\nIf he could have done this in a matter of few months, so you can! With this, you can also follow him more for his genre and ask questions directly through the official [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/watchmeescape/?hl=en)."}, {"autor": "SelfConsciousCorndog", "selftext": "nan", "title": "I took this on an iPhone 7, how can I improve?", "num-comments": 1, "score": 1, "date": "2019-09-03 00:21:41", "content": "-----> I !!!  took this on an iPhone 7, how can -----> I !!!  -----> improve !!! ?"}, {"autor": "OhMerxy", "selftext": "nan", "title": "Me and my friends are creating an Instagram account for new and experienced photographers.

Their view was that the pay was so low to do minimal adjustments of 2-3 hours total, and one of them was shooting raw and jpg, and just going to give jpgs to the client shot as is.\n \nMy current workflow is:\n- Import overnight, including 1:1 previews\n- Apply a preset I have made for my look at import, and also apply keywords\n- After import, first filter though all photos, removing missed focus, duplicates where they are very similar etc.\n- Adjust exposure / highlight/shadow/white/black as needed for any super contrasty photos (eg shooting into sun so subjects face is dark).

I actually think the effect of the prism filters looks kind of cool but I don\u2019t want to spent 75\u20ac on a filter which I would only be using very rarely anyway. As I was reading through the comments a few people suggested to just build the filter yourself by using a cheap UV filter and adding some rhinestones to it and that\u2019s what I did. So here\u2019s a recap of the process and I also want to provide the overlays I ended up with (but more on this later):\n\n1. Bought a cheap UV Filter and some rhinestones on Amazon (actually did end up not using the rhinestones because they had an opaque surface on the bottom, instead used glass)\n2. Shattered the glass of an old frame with a hammer until I had a lot of small little pieces\n3. Attached the filter to a lens (so I know which side of the filter is up)\n4. Now I picked up smaller pieces of the glass and used a brush to add a little bit of glue to each piece which I then placed in the upper area of the filter (by placing them in the upper part the flare effect will be more visible \\_I think\\_)\n5. Every now and then I tested the look of it by pointing my camera in a bright light source and moving it around (with different focal lengths and focus)\n6. Once I was satisfied I also wanted to create overlays with this effect, so I don\u2019t have to carry this filter with me all the time, but instead can apply this effect in Photoshop\n7. To make those overlay presets I grabbed a black blanket which I placed behind some bright lights and captured some photos / videos while pointing the camera at the blanket. This is important so you later end up with a black background while the flare effect is visible over the background!\n8. Now when I want to add the flare effect to my image I simply place the overlay over it in Photoshop and change the blending mode to something like screen. Depending on the darkness of the background it might be a good idea to adjust the levels of the flare layer a bit.\n\nIf you want to play around with this effect but don\u2019t want to spend any money you can just use my overlays which I have shot yesterday!

Shattered the glass of an old frame with a hammer until I had a lot of small little pieces\n3. Attached the filter to a lens (so I know which side of the filter is up)\n4. Now I picked up smaller pieces of the glass and used a brush to add a little bit of glue to each piece which I then placed in the upper area of the filter (by placing them in the upper part the flare effect will be more visible \\_I think\\_)\n5. Every now and then I tested the look of it by pointing my camera in a bright light source and moving it around (with different focal lengths and focus)\n6. Once -----> I !!!  was satisfied -----> I !!!  also wanted to -----> create !!!  overlays with this effect, so -----> I !!!  don\u2019t have to carry this filter with me all the time, but instead can apply this effect in Photoshop\n7. To make those overlay presets I grabbed a black blanket which I placed behind some bright lights and captured some photos / videos while pointing the camera at the blanket. This is important so you later end up with a black background while the flare effect is visible over the background!\n8. Now when I want to add the flare effect to my image I simply place the overlay over it in Photoshop and change the blending mode to something like screen. Depending on the darkness of the background it might be a good idea to adjust the levels of the flare layer a bit.\n\nIf you want to play around with this effect but don\u2019t want to spend any money you can just use my overlays which I have shot yesterday!

Some basic scenarios for me are ***\u201c\u2026Oh? You couldn\u2019t book a professional photographer for your wedding? Well, I\u2019ve got your back if you need it, I do this stuff on the side\u201d*** I then deliver a wedding gallery better than the portfolio of the photographer they originally wanted.\n\nOther times I\u2019ll meet someone around my age and it typically goes, ***\u201c\u2026Oh? You\u2019re a photographer?\u201d***  They proceed to show me their influencer level portfolio, then ask if I\u2019m also a photographer and I\u2019ll say ***\u201cAhhh pshhhh I\u2019ve just got like, a Nikon\u2026 D\u2026 7000 or something?\u201d***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt won\u2019t be so easy to shrug off the fact that I have a studio, It will force me to step out more and commit to the discussion and to truly invest in my ideas with photography. I think that is an important frame of mind all photographers should have from the beginning no matter what skill level they are, and the sooner you feel that way the better long term effect it will have on your ideas, morels, skills, and most importantly your portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said earlier I couldn\u2019t afford a good therapist, and while that\u2019s DEFINITELY the case now, I\u2019ll admit truthfully that given an actual choice, I would rather choose the studio instead!\n\nHopefully, this mental scratch pad of a post will help someone work through similar thoughts, or perhaps make others feel flustered, regardless, I just wanted to stake my new little studio flag in the ground, and reflect on my thoughts from way back when until now. \n\n**Keep taking pictures, keep sharing, and talk about your work no matter what**"}, {"autor": "GGImBatman", "selftext": "I am a keen photographer and have always wanted to improve my portrait photography and to get some nice portrait photos of people I don't know (with consent of course).
