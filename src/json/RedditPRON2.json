This went on for a few weeks and I began to pick up my older DSLR and film camera and just casually shooting a couple of weeks ago, not really paying much attention but just trying to have fun, I watched a few youtube videos earlier this week and I began to think about what photography really meant to me.  I wanted to meditate on this idea and get some thoughts down on paper, this is what I wrote:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018What does photography mean to me?\u00a0 Looking back at the beginning of my photography journey I\u2019m not sure if it is nostalgia or just the great (but not always) memories but everything (the photographs) seem to have a more of a magical sparkle to them.\u00a0 Things are just too easy now, I have every variable available to me at all times in post production that it seems to be a wish-list of skills and looks that is just rinse and repeat, image after image.*\n\n*Not photograph after photograph, these digital recreations of time is but a digital fingerprint of where I have been and what I have seen.\u00a0 Emptiness, lifeless landscape image with nobody to share them with.\u00a0 They only become photographs either when I print them to bring them into the physical world, or when that moment of capture is shared with somebody else.*\n\n*I have been a slave to the digital realm, focusing on sharpness, colour, micro-contrast, focus stacking, exposure bracketing, like seeking nothingness and it has not made me any happier, I think far from it.\u00a0 And has it moulded me into an inferior photography?*\n\n*Maybe\u2026*\n\n*Digital darkroom, photographic enhancement, luminosity masks and AI algorithms to stitch 120 megapixel monsters, pointless.\u00a0 Look at me, I have the latest PANIKONY MK7ii with XY2 lens and every other accessory available to man.\u00a0 But it is ok to use these, the question is should I?*\n\n*The landscapes I create used to mean so much to me finding perfection everywhere I go, the best light, composition, what filters, how to process and it all very well said and done, I have learnt many skills along the way, but at what sacrifice?\u00a0 To no longer look at the world with fresh eyes, but just to see a look, a feed, no story soul or meaning.*\n\n*I want to narrow my focus, and that focus has to be relevant and have meaning, at least to me.\u00a0 It is all about the story after all isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 To narrow my focus on the things that really mean something to me, my friends, family and life.\u00a0 Adventure is everywhere, I feel like I was in such a rush to quit Funky (old job) and have time, that I quit more than that job when I left.\u00a0 My work ethic has changed inside me, my fuel and fire has dwindled as I have had more opportunities.*\n\n*Is it because I feel I must suffer to succeed, No.\u00a0 But I need to be challenged, to be inquisitive, to be interested.\u00a0 Maybe if I was more interested in my own landscape images then somebody else would be too.\u00a0 I think thats why I made them, for others to look at, but I\u2019m still not sure what they see when they look at them.\u00a0 There is no story or meaning to them and I\u2019m not sure if just beauty is enough.*\n\n*Im not sure that this is a moment of self doubt, nut more the lines of realisation that a photographer can be whoever they want to be.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to fit into genres or follow trends.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to create new trends or even bring back old ones.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to be bold and think big, they don\u2019t need to be perfect and have all the answers.\u00a0 I think the only thing a photographer needs is the passion to tell a story.\u00a0 And I think it's time I carried on telling the only story I know.\u00a0 Mine.\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt like this really challenged my beliefs on what I was trying to do and get out of my images, where I wanted to see them and question who I was really pleasing.  Myself, a random person, or another photographer.  I think that its important to take steps back and re-evaluate whats happening in your photographic journey at whatever skill level you might be at.\n\nIt has led me to believe that I am just not that bothered about landscapes anymore and I don't really want to carry on pursuing them.  I am going back to older projects and coming up with new ideas of projects I want to do in the future to create the work that really means something to me.  \n\nIf you are relatively new to photography I think you should ask yourself what kind of images would you like to look back on in 20 years, what will tell that story for you.  If you are picking up a camera just to get likes and follow trends then you might just be wasting your time, and money.\n\nIf you are an experienced photographer I ask you this; \n\nWhat does photography mean to you and what are your goals or projects you are working on that captivates you over long periods of time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a follow up video about my journal entry the next day which is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XktF0GMqFgQ) if you want to check it out.\n\nAnd I also made a blog post discussing the same thoughts and ideas behind my struggles with storytelling in photography [here](https://www.luismoraisphoto.com/blog/my-struggles-with-storytelling-in-photography) if you want to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and have a great day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuis", "title": "Struggling with Storytelling in photography - Discussion, Video, Images and Journal entry - Long Post!", "num-comments": 5, "score": 2, "date": "2020-05-21 17:35:33", "content": "Struggling with Storytelling in photography - Discussion, Video, Images and Journal entry - Long Post! /!/ Im a part-time photographer and I used to have this real passion for landscape images.

I wanted to meditate on this idea and get some thoughts down on paper, this is what I wrote:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018What does photography mean to me?\u00a0 Looking back at the beginning of my photography journey I\u2019m not sure if it is nostalgia or just the great (but not always) memories but everything (the photographs) seem to have a more of a magical sparkle to them.\u00a0 Things are just too easy now, I have every variable available to me at all times in post production that it seems to be a wish-list of skills and looks that is just rinse and repeat, image after image.*\n\n*Not photograph after photograph, these digital recreations of time is but a digital fingerprint of where I have been and what I have seen.\u00a0 Emptiness, lifeless landscape image with nobody to share them with.\u00a0 They only become photographs either when I print them to bring them into the physical world, or when that moment of capture is shared with somebody else.*\n\n*I have been a slave to the digital realm, focusing on sharpness, colour, micro-contrast, focus stacking, exposure bracketing, like seeking nothingness and it has not made me any happier, I think far from it.\u00a0 And has it moulded me into an inferior photography?*\n\n*Maybe\u2026*\n\n*Digital darkroom, photographic enhancement, luminosity masks and AI algorithms to stitch 120 megapixel monsters, pointless.\u00a0 Look at me, I have the latest PANIKONY MK7ii with XY2 lens and every other accessory available to man.\u00a0 But it is ok to use these, the question is should I?*\n\n*The landscapes -----> I create !!!  used to mean so much to me finding perfection everywhere I go, the best light, composition, what filters, how to process and it all very well said and done, I have learnt many skills along the way, but at what sacrifice?\u00a0 To no longer look at the world with fresh eyes, but just to see a look, a feed, no story soul or meaning.*\n\n*I want to narrow my focus, and that focus has to be relevant and have meaning, at least to me.\u00a0 It is all about the story after all isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 To narrow my focus on the things that really mean something to me, my friends, family and life.\u00a0 Adventure is everywhere, I feel like I was in such a rush to quit Funky (old job) and have time, that I quit more than that job when I left.\u00a0 My work ethic has changed inside me, my fuel and fire has dwindled as I have had more opportunities.*\n\n*Is it because I feel I must suffer to succeed, No.\u00a0 But I need to be challenged, to be inquisitive, to be interested.\u00a0 Maybe if I was more interested in my own landscape images then somebody else would be too.\u00a0 I think thats why I made them, for others to look at, but I\u2019m still not sure what they see when they look at them.\u00a0 There is no story or meaning to them and I\u2019m not sure if just beauty is enough.*\n\n*Im not sure that this is a moment of self doubt, nut more the lines of realisation that a photographer can be whoever they want to be.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to fit into genres or follow trends.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to create new trends or even bring back old ones.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to be bold and think big, they don\u2019t need to be perfect and have all the answers.\u00a0 I think the only thing a photographer needs is the passion to tell a story.\u00a0 And I think it's time I carried on telling the only story I know.\u00a0 Mine.\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt like this really challenged my beliefs on what I was trying to do and get out of my images, where I wanted to see them and question who I was really pleasing.  Myself, a random person, or another photographer.  I think that its important to take steps back and re-evaluate whats happening in your photographic journey at whatever skill level you might be at.\n\nIt has led me to believe that I am just not that bothered about landscapes anymore and I don't really want to carry on pursuing them.  I am going back to older projects and coming up with new ideas of projects I want to do in the future to create the work that really means something to me.  \n\nIf you are relatively new to photography I think you should ask yourself what kind of images would you like to look back on in 20 years, what will tell that story for you.  If you are picking up a camera just to get likes and follow trends then you might just be wasting your time, and money.\n\nIf you are an experienced photographer I ask you this; \n\nWhat does photography mean to you and what are your goals or projects you are working on that captivates you over long periods of time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a follow up video about my journal entry the next day which is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XktF0GMqFgQ) if you want to check it out.\n\nAnd I also made a blog post discussing the same thoughts and ideas behind my struggles with storytelling in photography [here](https://www.luismoraisphoto.com/blog/my-struggles-with-storytelling-in-photography) if you want to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and have a great day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuis"}, {"autor": "MakeMuricaOkayAgain", "selftext": "Was wondering if any one was interested in joining a discord where we share RAWs and upload each other\u2019s photos for fun.

In one of our first conversations he told me about the \u201cprostitutes\u201d in the bohemian neighbourhood called Temple Bar. I was surprised because after couple of years living near Temple Bar I have never seen a sex worker. During the conversation I realized the women he was referring to, as sex workers, were just women wearing mini-skirt \u2013 which is a very common women outfit in Ireland and UK even during winter. For the new comer from Brazil women showing more legs than he was used to see in public had an automatic association to prostitution.  \n\n\nIn my first couple of weeks in Freiburg \u2013 Germany -, when I was looking for a place to live, I was eating in a bar with my mother when a group of 5 men joined our big table. During the conversation they learned we are Brazilians and told us with a big enthusiasm they were going to spend their holidays, in the following month, in Brazil. After a while I asked one of them, who didn\u2019t share the same enthusiasm than the others, if he was going to spend his holidays in Brazil as well. He answered with a gesture of showing his wedding ring on his finger. I suddenly thought he was suggesting that his friends were going to Brazil with sexual intentions, specially because sex tourism in Brazil is very common and many people in Sough Germany\u00a0have the image of Brazilian women as being easy to take to bed \u2013 Since Brazilians are often very attracted to foreigners. Maybe I misinterpreted his gesture, maybe he was just saying that he is not as free to travel as his friends who are single, because of family responsibilities, but I could not help thinking about sex tourism through his silent message.  \n\n\nI think it is interesting the fact that among Brazil, Ireland and Germany the first is the more conservative and moralist when the subject is nudity, which is a false morality to protect them from their own dirty minds. Different from Germany with many parks and saunas where people can spend their time - on their own, with friends or with their families - completely naked . During German\u2019s summer toddlers are running and playing completely nude in their gardens while in Brazil parents are concerned about their toddlers private parts, or even underwear, being exposed in public. In Brazil there are some isolated beaches with nude areas but in general nudity is not tolerated or allowed - not even topless regarding women. In Brazil nudity is automatically associated with sexual provocation. Ireland and the UK don\u2019t have the open air or sauna nude culture as in the Nordic countries but nobody minds women showing their skin. Once a naked woman, walking in the streets in the UK, was stopped by a policeman, not to reprimand her but, to inform her about the law saying that her being nude in public is not an offense, but if somebody complains for feeling offended then it becomes an offense.  \n\n\nAny bath place is supposed to be a place where people don\u2019t need to wear clothes. In South France, where it used to be common for people to be nude in the beaches, people, and specially women, feel less comfortable with nudity because of the new generation of young men who automatic associate nude women as a sign of \u201cavailable to sex\u201d. Women, then, became more frequent victims of harassment.  \n\n\nWhen I started with photography, in Ireland, it was always easy to find people to photograph, especially women. Soon I had my first boudoir photo shoot which for my surprise ended as nude photo shoot. It was a woman who contacted me looking for sensual photos but during the photo shoot she felt comfortable enough to just take out her clothes and continuous the shooting naked. Thanks to her I had photos for my portfolio which brought me more women wanting nude photos, especially after I developed a classic visual language with film negative\u00a0photos that people became attracted to. Most people associate nude photography with pornography - anything can be turned into pornography in fact, it only requires the viewer imagination and intention\\[1\\]\u00a0\u2013 but it is not how I see my work. As a man I am naturally interested in women's beauty and women's bodies but it doesn\u2019t mean I have the sexual view about people I photograph for being naked but the opposite; I have a big respect for people who trust me and my work since most of my photo shoots are just me and the model.  \n\n\nSome people, especially in Brazil, quickly ask me if I sleep with the models I photograph because they can\u2019t help associating nudity to sexual activity. Nudity, instead, gives people a sense of freedom. I only photographed a couple of nude men and it was more evident from them their enthusiasm for being naked - and for having a creative image of their body's expression. I first released\u00a0it when I was photographing a woman who the body seemed stuck during my posing direction. I told her that she doesn\u2019t look comfortable and that I could not get good body composition from her. She then asked me if I could see her private parts, to which I replied saying that I am too focused on the body composition, lighting, camera setting, framing , focus and the image narrative that looking at her private parts never crossed my mind. It seemed to me her worries came from the fact I was photographing her with an old manual film camera, with a slow focus ring in the lens; Because of the system it takes me a little extra time to find the focus before I press the camera shutter release. I tried to explain about the camera to her but she was satisfied with my first explanation; She didn\u2019t want to hear about my camera but go on with the photo shoot, this time feeling completely free with no worries about what in her body may be exposed, even if it appears in the photo. It is through people's eyes where we confirm who we are \\[2\\].  \n\n\nWe fear people's judgement which makes us feel self-conscious. When we are self-conscious, we feel uncomfortable, dissociated from the place and people around us, alien to our surroundings, causing us to cover who we are looking for privacy. Being naked and being accepted as we are without clothes means self-confirmation and so self-acceptance. It gives people more confidence about their body and so about themselves, because they can do whatever they are doing and forget about themselves, feeling more connected to whatever they are doing, enjoying the moment completely and so feeling free. Many people ask me how I convince people to take their clothes off or how I convince women to have certain poses when naked. I never needed to convince anybody to do anything, it was all their decision in the first place, their self-disclosure, to the joy of appearing in the world and deed without equivocation and without self-reflection that are inherent in action\\[3\\].  \n\n\nIn Germany it is much more difficult to have people who want nude photo shoots. Instead of paying me they want to be paid. Often it has to do with the fact that Germans are more cynic for feeling suspicious about people's intentions, especially those who they don\u2019t know. German introversion makes them feel more alienated from people and so more self-conscious, which explains the awkwardness that often Germans have. But this cynicism and uneasy feeling among strangers is not the main reason, it seems. I believe the main reason is because they are more used and so comfortable enough with their naked body in public. Instead of photo shoots, for the creative expression of their body freedom, they rather go to saunas and nude public parks where they can enjoy the freedom of their body without the need of interaction with another person, but on their own or with their family in their introverted manner.  \n\u200b  \nThe ancient Greek had the Polis, the public space where people could interact and become equal to others, which separate them from their private life where people had their own individuality. This public space was for Theseus what enabled ordinary man to bear life\u2019s burden, for providing the safe space for public interaction, but it was also where people hide their individuality in order to become equals and so respect each other \\[4\\]. The medieval Christianity\u00a0thinking and social tradition had no Polis separating the public and the private. People became equal to each other not through a political space designated for political interaction but through every individual, where God becomes ubiquitous in every person's eyes, turning their presence public and their action as action towards God itself \\[5\\]. Consequently, people had to hide more of themselves in order to preserve their individuality. I feel Germans keep something of this separation of public and private tradition, with their closed friend circle as their Polis where they can interact and express themselves to each other as equal, while outside it they can be \u201cnaked\u201d, with no need to hide their individuality in order to preserve it; Or as Germans like to say, \u201c*being direct\u201d*. The Irish, maintaining a more medieval Christian\u00a0tradition, have the public space on every individual eyes who they can interact and express themselves with, in order to bear life burden, but hiding their individuality in order to preserve it. The photo shooting seems to be for the Irish the private sphere where people can be free from the public \u201cburden\u201d but, at the same time, they can appear to the public by showing their individual expression through the photo results, since it is only through others\u2019 eyes we can confirm ourselves. It also seems to be the reason the so-called \u201cGerman directness\u201d is interpreted as rudeness for most westerns. Politeness is in fact against directness; Hiding our true thinking and wish to act, our individuality, to respect those through whom we see ourselves as in the eyes of the public arena \u2013 God ubiquitous. Germans feel free to not hide their true feelings because what the Irish see as public for the Germans is seen as private, the space where people can have their individuality, action without the public \u201cburden\u201d. The German introversion seems to be a preservation of their individuality on what for the Irish is supposed to be public.  \n\n\nIn today\u2019s society there is no such thing as private space other than our own home \\[6\\]. The patriarchal family was supposed to be the private kingship where one can have our individuality freedom apart from the public, the reason the Greeks, originally a matriarchal society, created the Polis as contrast to the private patriarchal kingdom \\[7\\]. God ubiquitous came to replace the Polis during Medieval times. The Equality among people is what is replacing God ubiquitous in today\u2019s society. Universal equality invades even the patriarchal family \u2013 the private kingdom \u2013 in order to assure people\u2019s basic equality rights.  \n\n\n\u200bDifferent cultures find their way to appear and to hide. In order to keep prolific with nude photography, after moving to Germany, I started photographing myself; this time with pinhole cameras which work with long exposure photography. I never felt completely comfortable being nude in public - especially coming from a judging and mocking culture that is strong in Brazil, where the public and the private are merged and confused as attempt to find their individual expression and, at the same time, afraid of losing both all together \u2013 but doing my creative work, that now included my own body expression, made me feel very good and more comfortable in my own body. Like a work of art which we create from our own expression, the body then becomes a work of art \u2013 or it has always been - through which we find our individuality in our nudity and, at the same time, our public expression through the image result. The public where we confirm our own self narrative, which without we have no identity.\n\n  \n\\----\n\n\u200b\\[1\\] HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros. Separata de; HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros: Essays.

In one of our first conversations he told me about the \u201cprostitutes\u201d in the bohemian neighbourhood called Temple Bar. I was surprised because after couple of years living near Temple Bar I have never seen a sex worker. During the conversation I realized the women he was referring to, as sex workers, were just women wearing mini-skirt \u2013 which is a very common women outfit in Ireland and UK even during winter. For the new comer from Brazil women showing more legs than he was used to see in public had an automatic association to prostitution.  \n\n\nIn my first couple of weeks in Freiburg \u2013 Germany -, when I was looking for a place to live, I was eating in a bar with my mother when a group of 5 men joined our big table. During the conversation they learned we are Brazilians and told us with a big enthusiasm they were going to spend their holidays, in the following month, in Brazil. After a while I asked one of them, who didn\u2019t share the same enthusiasm than the others, if he was going to spend his holidays in Brazil as well. He answered with a gesture of showing his wedding ring on his finger. I suddenly thought he was suggesting that his friends were going to Brazil with sexual intentions, specially because sex tourism in Brazil is very common and many people in Sough Germany\u00a0have the image of Brazilian women as being easy to take to bed \u2013 Since Brazilians are often very attracted to foreigners. Maybe I misinterpreted his gesture, maybe he was just saying that he is not as free to travel as his friends who are single, because of family responsibilities, but I could not help thinking about sex tourism through his silent message.  \n\n\nI think it is interesting the fact that among Brazil, Ireland and Germany the first is the more conservative and moralist when the subject is nudity, which is a false morality to protect them from their own dirty minds. Different from Germany with many parks and saunas where people can spend their time - on their own, with friends or with their families - completely naked . During German\u2019s summer toddlers are running and playing completely nude in their gardens while in Brazil parents are concerned about their toddlers private parts, or even underwear, being exposed in public. In Brazil there are some isolated beaches with nude areas but in general nudity is not tolerated or allowed - not even topless regarding women. In Brazil nudity is automatically associated with sexual provocation. Ireland and the UK don\u2019t have the open air or sauna nude culture as in the Nordic countries but nobody minds women showing their skin. Once a naked woman, walking in the streets in the UK, was stopped by a policeman, not to reprimand her but, to inform her about the law saying that her being nude in public is not an offense, but if somebody complains for feeling offended then it becomes an offense.  \n\n\nAny bath place is supposed to be a place where people don\u2019t need to wear clothes. In South France, where it used to be common for people to be nude in the beaches, people, and specially women, feel less comfortable with nudity because of the new generation of young men who automatic associate nude women as a sign of \u201cavailable to sex\u201d. Women, then, became more frequent victims of harassment.  \n\n\nWhen I started with photography, in Ireland, it was always easy to find people to photograph, especially women. Soon I had my first boudoir photo shoot which for my surprise ended as nude photo shoot. It was a woman who contacted me looking for sensual photos but during the photo shoot she felt comfortable enough to just take out her clothes and continuous the shooting naked. Thanks to her I had photos for my portfolio which brought me more women wanting nude photos, especially after -----> I developed !!!  a classic visual language with film negative\u00a0photos that people became attracted to. Most people associate nude photography with pornography - anything can be turned into pornography in fact, it only requires the viewer imagination and intention\\[1\\]\u00a0\u2013 but it is not how I see my work. As a man I am naturally interested in women's beauty and women's bodies but it doesn\u2019t mean I have the sexual view about people I photograph for being naked but the opposite; I have a big respect for people who trust me and my work since most of my photo shoots are just me and the model.  \n\n\nSome people, especially in Brazil, quickly ask me if I sleep with the models I photograph because they can\u2019t help associating nudity to sexual activity. Nudity, instead, gives people a sense of freedom. I only photographed a couple of nude men and it was more evident from them their enthusiasm for being naked - and for having a creative image of their body's expression. I first released\u00a0it when I was photographing a woman who the body seemed stuck during my posing direction. I told her that she doesn\u2019t look comfortable and that I could not get good body composition from her. She then asked me if I could see her private parts, to which I replied saying that I am too focused on the body composition, lighting, camera setting, framing , focus and the image narrative that looking at her private parts never crossed my mind. It seemed to me her worries came from the fact I was photographing her with an old manual film camera, with a slow focus ring in the lens; Because of the system it takes me a little extra time to find the focus before I press the camera shutter release. I tried to explain about the camera to her but she was satisfied with my first explanation; She didn\u2019t want to hear about my camera but go on with the photo shoot, this time feeling completely free with no worries about what in her body may be exposed, even if it appears in the photo. It is through people's eyes where we confirm who we are \\[2\\].  \n\n\nWe fear people's judgement which makes us feel self-conscious. When we are self-conscious, we feel uncomfortable, dissociated from the place and people around us, alien to our surroundings, causing us to cover who we are looking for privacy. Being naked and being accepted as we are without clothes means self-confirmation and so self-acceptance. It gives people more confidence about their body and so about themselves, because they can do whatever they are doing and forget about themselves, feeling more connected to whatever they are doing, enjoying the moment completely and so feeling free. Many people ask me how I convince people to take their clothes off or how I convince women to have certain poses when naked. I never needed to convince anybody to do anything, it was all their decision in the first place, their self-disclosure, to the joy of appearing in the world and deed without equivocation and without self-reflection that are inherent in action\\[3\\].  \n\n\nIn Germany it is much more difficult to have people who want nude photo shoots.

It's been fun, 99% of the photos I take myself and edit myself. On occasion I collaborate with someone like a boyfriend, friend, or photographer on something. \n\nLast year, I designed and hand-made a dress to be nearly identical to one that Audrey Hepburn wore in an early photo in Kew Gardens. I put together the whole outfit, and when I went to London, my plan was to go there either with a tripod or a friend and make my recreations. A newer friend of mine (we met because of a mutual ex-boyfriend) volunteered her teenage son to help take the photo, since he likes photography. \n\nWe met at the park, and we started looking for the locations where the photos in Audrey's photo session were taken. I handed him my camera, and I and his mom would check the pictures on my phone to double check the angles and the poses. I ended up with three photos on my 'to do' list, which I then took home and edited, and shared on Instagram, of course thanking them for their help.\n\nCut to this year, another friend was working with a publisher on a book on Audrey Hepburn and really wanted to include some photos of me in the introduction. I sent over 9 of my favourites, including one from Kew. He decided on two that I had edited myself into, which were taken in the 1950's and 1960's. I assume he did whatever needed done to clear those. And the third was one from Kew. \n\nNow, the whole time before this, I've been very good at giving photographers credit, but for some reason it just never crossed my mind, this whole time. It's been a stressful year - I moved from California to France, and then went on a 3 month road trip (with my cat) between five countries. Then I spent a month apartment-hunting, and then trying to furnish the place. I've been extremely forgetful. I'll find emails I failed to reply to from 3 months ago. Anyway when I posted a photo of the page in the book, it was *then* that it was brought to my attention. I freaked the hell out and had a panic attack. I didn't mean to do that to my friends who had helped me create this picture I love. I was a wreck. I wrote her an apology message (which she still hasn't replied to, 5 days later) and then basically posted on IG that I had to take a mental health break for a while. I couldn't deal. For 3 days. Just couldn't eat, couldn't do much of anything, but I decided to limit my social media, and anything unnecessary, start looking for a therapist, do *anything* I could do for myself because I don't even feel in control of my own brain at this point. Anyway I got it together and wrote her son a long apology on Friday, and told him what I would try to do to fix it, and to make it up to him. Still no response. But now my friend who used the photo for the book (who hadn't seemed concerned up until this point, calling it an 'assisted self-portrait', and I don't know, he's dealt with photos for decades, he's a collector and author and worked at the National Portrait Gallery) said that the kid has sent an angry email to his publisher, which wasn't very cool.\n\nSide note. My own personal issue here is WTF would they not even talk to me privately but rather make public posts, share it with their friends who call me horrible names, and then email the publisher but never even try to clear it up with me first. \n\nBut my legal question (and sorry it took me this long to write this, but UGGGGG) is who owns this photo? I mean I was thinking about it today and honestly, I would be kind of pissed if HE used it without telling me, or asking me. Because it's my project, my series, I put way more effort into creating the photo than he did (I spent DAYS making the dress), he has no use for it, and I basically just handed him my camera. If you handed a friend your camera and directed them on how to take the picture, how can they possibly claim that it's 'theirs'? Personally, yes, I would appreciate a credit if someone used the photo I took of them, but I certainly wouldn't stop them from using it if they were the ones to conceive it and do all the work to create it. This is MY photo. Now he's trying to limit what I can do with it, just because he stood there and pushed the button. I have another friend who told me to do whatever I wanted with the photos she took of me. We're friends and it's for fun. Now of course when I work with a photographer and sign a release, I get that I have to ask them first. But I'm 99% sure we did not sign a release (I'll leave 1% of doubt because I'm forgetful and haven't dug through my papers. But in my moving process I don't recall coming across one for that day).

But hell, if he's going to be such an asshole about it, I'll just go back and take new photos there next time I'm in London. \n\nI'm definitely feeling bad about not acknowledging him, but I'm also getting pretty annoyed right now at the way they're dealing with this.

I\u2019m a graphic designer and all though most of the photographs go into a folder titled \u201cweb scrap book/photojournal\u201d that I look over from time to time, I do browse through the folder if I know I might have something perfect for a design project. Metadata is often overlooked. If I look at the photograph and it has no metadata to tell me who took it, it was uploaded to a platform that allows me to download it freely, and I can\u2019t find what I need through a reverse image search. I act as if the photographer intended for their art to be shared for free. I would like to save information about the poster but it isn\u2019t something I can do in two clicks. I would like to give the original artist recognition in the metadata of any file I create regardless of licensing too. It\u2019s really simple to add metadata in photoshop and other editing software. This is something that we should all be focusing on. A good picture will spread across the internet rather quickly. Although the quality might be less than due to compression, so long as I don\u2019t have to enlarge the photograph or use it for print (in some cases) the photo is usually good. We all have differing opinions when it comes to license. Ethical designers look for this information because we don\u2019t appreciate theft of intellectual property either. Watermarks are a good, Reddit automatically puts a bar at the bottom of the photo with the name of the user who posted it. I don\u2019t like to be dependent on watermarks because they rub clients the wrong way and can be disruptive to composition. I know pro photographers are aware of how much their content can be worth so they work with stock companies. I have a few pictures posted on line that were taken on my cell phone that aren\u2019t up to pro quality but are still good enough to use depending on how. Sometimes the random cell phone shot is the missing piece to a composition. My whole point, ya never know, I\u2019m not educated about copyright laws but I feel like a court would respect metadata as proof that an artist owns content. I would be enraged to find out that a large corporation was using my content without cutting me out a piece of the pie. Seeing my content used by Non profits, small business, and In portfolio work wouldn\u2019t bug me at all. If I donate work to non-profit organizations I can claim it on my taxes, that\u2019s a win win. If I include a line in metadata indicating who I\u2019m willing to donate too then they don\u2019t even have to ask for it to be considered donated. The most important inclusion is contact information though.

I\u2019m a graphic designer and all though most of the photographs go into a folder titled \u201cweb scrap book/photojournal\u201d that I look over from time to time, I do browse through the folder if I know I might have something perfect for a design project. Metadata is often overlooked. If I look at the photograph and it has no metadata to tell me who took it, it was uploaded to a platform that allows me to download it freely, and I can\u2019t find what I need through a reverse image search. I act as if the photographer intended for their art to be shared for free. I would like to save information about the poster but it isn\u2019t something I can do in two clicks. I would like to give the original artist recognition in the metadata of any file -----> I create !!!  regardless of licensing too. It\u2019s really simple to add metadata in photoshop and other editing software. This is something that we should all be focusing on. A good picture will spread across the internet rather quickly. Although the quality might be less than due to compression, so long as I don\u2019t have to enlarge the photograph or use it for print (in some cases) the photo is usually good. We all have differing opinions when it comes to license. Ethical designers look for this information because we don\u2019t appreciate theft of intellectual property either. Watermarks are a good, Reddit automatically puts a bar at the bottom of the photo with the name of the user who posted it. I don\u2019t like to be dependent on watermarks because they rub clients the wrong way and can be disruptive to composition. I know pro photographers are aware of how much their content can be worth so they work with stock companies. I have a few pictures posted on line that were taken on my cell phone that aren\u2019t up to pro quality but are still good enough to use depending on how. Sometimes the random cell phone shot is the missing piece to a composition. My whole point, ya never know, I\u2019m not educated about copyright laws but I feel like a court would respect metadata as proof that an artist owns content. I would be enraged to find out that a large corporation was using my content without cutting me out a piece of the pie. Seeing my content used by Non profits, small business, and In portfolio work wouldn\u2019t bug me at all. If I donate work to non-profit organizations I can claim it on my taxes, that\u2019s a win win. If I include a line in metadata indicating who I\u2019m willing to donate too then they don\u2019t even have to ask for it to be considered donated. The most important inclusion is contact information though.

My main purpose is documenting my hikes, which I used to do with my phone, but wanted an upgrade in image quality.\n\nWith the camera, my process for dealing with the pictures has changed quite a bit, and the effort has increased significantly. I also feel like my methods aren't exactly efficient, but I'm not sure what exactly I could improve. So I'd like to collect your preferred processes and learn from them.\n\nFor the record, these are my old and current processes, respectively:\n\n**Old Process (Phone)**\n\n1. Let MS Onedrive back up the pictures from my phone.\n\n2. Create an album for that day/hike/event from the camera reel.\n\n3. Delete the bad or unsuitable pictures from the album.\n\n4. Download the album to my computer and back it up locally.\n\n**New Process**\n\n1. Insert SD Card into card reader on PC.\n\n2. Look through pictures, deleting bad ones and rating really good ones as 4/5 stars within Windows Explorer. See step 4 for relevance of the latter.\n\n3. Be annoyed with Windows 10 because Windows 7 was better and more convenient at literally everything. Be salty about lost functionality like jumping to the file from the open photo, or being able to have the preview and details pane open simultaneously, as well as being able to rate the picture from the open photo without having to switch back to the folder and looking for the current image by name to be able to rate it.\n\n4. Sort by name, manually select the RAW files corresponding to the 4-5 star rated JPEGs, and send them over to a \"Source/RAW\" folder on the hard drive (No use in keeping the mediocre RAWs).\n\n5. Send the remaining JPEGs to the Source folder.\n\n6. At this point, I would use rawtherapee to create optimal PNGs from the RAW files, but I'm still learning how to make those not look shit, so instead at this point, I edit the JPEGs that could be good but need some adjustments.\n\n7. Create an Album folder for that Day/Hike/Event and copy (not move) all the pictures over.\n\n8. Delete the ones I don't want in the Album.\n\n9. Upload the album folder to Onedrive (web, not the windows folder. I hate how that one works) for backup / sharing among family and friends.\n\n10. Optionally copy individual pictures to different folders comprising various topical favorite images like \"of my wife\", \"of my pets\", etc.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nI'm currently wasting up to around 110% extra hard drive space by copying images into various themed folders. This is not an issue yet, but might become costly in the future.\n\nThe reason I do this is that I find it the easiest method to find the pictures later, it's the most convenient form of organization to my brain, shortcuts and tags wouldn't work for uploading, and I don't trust tags.\n\nWhen I say I don't trust tags, I mean I don't want to go through hours of effort tagging images by content only to find in ten years that my new operating system doesn't know what to do with the tags I created in Windows 10, for example. Themed folders full of copied files seem much more reliable.\n\nThe downside of copy pasting is that if I alter an image later on, be it in name or the image itself, I have to apply those changes everywhere else the image is saved as well.\n\nI think the biggest issue currently is how long steps 1-6 are taking me, and I'm almost sure there has to be a better way, perhaps 3rd party software assisted. \n\nI'd also like to waste less hard drive space, and have the images thematically filed but connected.\n\nI've considered having Onedrive (web) as my canonical filing space and using their tags and albums instead of copying files, as that resolves all my issues except the futureproofing aspect (I'd hate to have to reorganize tens of thousands of pictures the day I stop using Onedrive.)\n\n**What do you do yourself?
