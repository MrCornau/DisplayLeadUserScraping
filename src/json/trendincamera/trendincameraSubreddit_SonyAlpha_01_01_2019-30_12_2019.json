It feels like getting the a7iii would primarily be for the full frame sensor, where the low light difference is there, but not drastic enough that a faster lense + neatvideo can't come fairly close. Meanwhile, the eye af on the 7RIV is receiving great praise and makes me feel like the AF performance on the a6600 would outperform the a7iii.   \nOn the flip side, if sony announces an a7iv that essentially has all of the above and possibly 4k/60, then this is a moot question.  \nPrice wise in canada, it's 1900 for the 6600 vs 2600 for the a7iii.  \nAny thoughts on those with experience with the a7iii / those also interested in the a6600?  \nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/dzo094/a6600_confusion_v_a7iii/"}, {"autor": "toilets_for_sale", "date": "2019-04-02 16:28:00", "content": "An American Goldfinch with an itch. | \u03b17RIII + Nikon 500mm f/4 P -----> ai !!! -s", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/b8lg0l/an_american_goldfinch_with_an_itch_\u03b17riii_nikon/"}, {"autor": "PasteEater", "date": "2019-06-10 17:42:49", "content": "Door Spider | Sony A7iii | Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 -----> AI !!!  w/adapter", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/bz0u01/door_spider_sony_a7iii_nikkor_50mm_f18_ai_wadapter/"}, {"autor": "ThatVRGuy_", "date": "2019-07-24 18:38:44", "content": "Atlanta Skyline | A7iii | Nikon 28mm f/3.5 -----> Ai !!!

Both are on sale right now (Sony A7ii for $1000 with 28-70 kit lens and Fujifilm X-T100 for $500 with XC15-45mm kit Lens). I mostly shoot stills (landscapes, portraits), with probably an occasional video (1080p is fine for me), so autofocus and video performance is not that important for me. I've also got a few manual Nikon lenses lying around (50 mm F1.4 -----> AI !!! -S and 55mm f/2.8 AI-S micro) that I would love to adapt, so manual focus performance (like focus peaking) would matter quite a lot for me.\n\nPros of the Sony: Fullframe, IBIS, probably better for adapting old lenses (no crop factor and image stabilization)?\n\nPros of the Fuji: Much newer (2018 vs. 2015), half price, lighter, silent electronic shutter, flip screen, maybe better JPEGs.\n\nI was wondering if there might be a significance image quality difference (like in low light) for the two cameras?\n\nAlso do you think the $500 difference is worth the upgrade to the fullframe Sony?\n\nI've been going back and forth on this decision for days and can't make up my mind :P, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/bk4xx9/sony_a7ii_for_1000_vs_fujifilm_xt100_for_500/"}, {"autor": "lswchung80", "date": "2019-12-03 14:31:12", "content": "Wolf in the arctic forest- Sony alpha a7iii, Nikon 105mm f2.5 -----> Ai !!! -s", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/e5hwcs/wolf_in_the_arctic_forest_sony_alpha_a7iii_nikon/"}, {"autor": "Feremel", "date": "2019-04-24 22:53:48", "content": "New York a7III (Nikon 50mm -----> AI !!! -S)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/bh17g7/new_york_a7iii_nikon_50mm_ais/"}, {"autor": "stanfordcardinal", "date": "2019-02-25 17:16:24", "content": "Pure Awe | Sony A7S; Nikon 50mm f/1.2 -----> AI !!! -S | San Francisco Bay Bridge", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/aunmln/pure_awe_sony_a7s_nikon_50mm_f12_ais_san/"}, {"autor": "imgoldsworthy", "date": "2019-12-20 04:24:01", "content": "Snagged a Nikkor -----> ai !!! -s 135 f/2.8 // Sony a7iii", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/ed4zm4/snagged_a_nikkor_ais_135_f28_sony_a7iii/"}, {"autor": "lswchung80", "date": "2019-11-24 03:28:24", "content": "Baby monitor lizard - a7iii, Nikon 180mm f/2.8 ED -----> AI !!! -s", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/e0t2gt/baby_monitor_lizard_a7iii_nikon_180mm_f28_ed_ais/"}], "name": "Subreddit_SonyAlpha_01_01_2019-30_12_2019"}
