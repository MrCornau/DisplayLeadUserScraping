How do you find it? /!/ Hi all, \n\nI'm currently invested in a full frame Canon ecosystem (Canon 6D, range of lenses). \n\nI'm looking at going mirrorless and the Canon R / RP both have drawbacks I feel I can't ignore, leaving me the supremely expensive Canon R6 as an option. \n\nAs a consequence I've been thinking about other ecosystems: Fuji and Sony. \n\nSony looks technically fantastic: the cheaper A7 III can do all I want in a camera *but* ergonomically it's a bit smaller and more 'edged' than I'd like. I love the fast autofocus and that's a key perquisite for me as I'll be shooting my dog a lot. \n\nThis leads me to Fuji, whose XT-3 and XT-4 look *stunning* and are quite competitive price wise. I've read that autofocus is good etc. \n\nHowever... they're the only non-full frame system.\n\nOn top of my dog I also shoot events / music festivals which can involve some low-light work, so lack of noise is another thing I look for and I gather FF generally helps there, plus there's the general FF 'feel'. It's been a while since I shot anything on a smaller sensor barring my phone, where -----> AI !!!  does a lot of the work. \n\nSo... \n\nHave any of you moved across from a FF ecosystem before? How do you find Fuji's lineup and could you honestly recommend it considering what I've said? \n\nThanks folks, really welcome your thoughts here :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/mycsep/has_anyone_here_switched_to_a_fuji_xt3xt4_for/"}, {"autor": "Hauneul", "date": "2021-04-23 03:14:14", "content": "Evening Walk, X-T2, Nikkor 50mm 1.8 -----> AI !!!

I have an assortment of Nikkor -----> AI !!!  manual focus prime lenses (28mm, 50mm, 105mm, 200mm) .\n\nI find that I often carry along my film cameras because they are small and light when I'm going somewhere impromptu, and don't take my D700 along unless its pre-planned to be photography related. And when I get there, I shoot some photographs with my FM or FE, and shoot many other photographs with my iPhone. To me this is sub-optimal, I'm only using the iPhone because that's the digital camera I have on me at the time.\n\nI would like to get a smaller digital camera that I can take everywhere with me. I would like this camera to have interchangeable lenses so that I can also use my Nikkor manual focus lenses via an adapter if I want to, in addition to whatever FujiX lenses I may have on me.\n\nAs a film shooter on cameras with dials, I like the layout of Fuji cameras compared to cameras from other manufacturers. Therefore not looking at Canon, Nikon or Sony offerings. I am happy with the results of the APS-C sensor I have seen online.\n\nI thought about and declined the idea of an XT4. It is large and heavy (not as much as my D700 but still enough to make me think twice about taking it along). I think the XPro3 would have the same limitation for me.\n\nI declined the idea of the X100V because of its fixed lens.\n\nThe two cameras therefore on my shortlist are: the X-E4 and the X-T30. \n\nThey both look to be the same size. I like the X-T30 because it seems to have more dials and buttons. The X-E4 seems smaller. Both I think have the same image quality (correct me if I'm missing something). I would get either of them with at least one pancake lens - and the XE4 comes in a kit with the 27mm R WR lens, the XT30 does not, so a pancake lens would be an additional purchase with the XT30.\n\nI tried the XT30 and XE3 (store didn't have a display XE4) with an adapter and my Nikon lenses. I was very happy with my ability to focus with the focus peaking feature. I note that MF focus assist only works in MF mode, and the XT30 has a physical switch for that, the XE4 does not.\n\nXE4 is newer - not sure if that makes a difference compared to the features that the XT30 already has.\n\nIs there any additional information you can share that may help move me in one direction or the other, with regards to these two cameras?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/m6m60r/small_pocketable_camera_for_the_film_shooter/"}, {"autor": "logaleano", "date": "2021-08-02 01:57:44", "content": "Her | fuji XT3 + yashica -----> ML !!!  50mm f1.9 + Cheap Pixco Speedbooster + Hairspray filter + Portra 400 recipe /!/ [removed]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/ow576i/her_fuji_xt3_yashica_ml_50mm_f19_cheap_pixco/"}, {"autor": "logaleano", "date": "2021-08-02 01:56:23", "content": "D\u00e9bora | fuji XT3 + yashica -----> ML !!!  50mm f1.9 + Cheap Pixco Speedbooster + Hairspray filter + Portra 400 recipe /!/ [removed]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/ow56gd/d\u00e9bora_fuji_xt3_yashica_ml_50mm_f19_cheap_pixco/"}, {"autor": "Hauneul", "date": "2021-07-25 17:27:21", "content": "Ten Birds, X-T2, Nikkor 50mm 1.8 -----> AI !!! , Portra Sim", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/orftgc/ten_birds_xt2_nikkor_50mm_18_ai_portra_sim/"}, {"autor": "Hauneul", "date": "2021-07-25 17:26:44", "content": "Evening Sky, X-T2, Nikkor 50mm 1.8 -----> AI !!! , Portra Sim", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/orft15/evening_sky_xt2_nikkor_50mm_18_ai_portra_sim/"}, {"autor": "Hauneul", "date": "2021-08-22 12:58:11", "content": "Monolith, X-T2, Nikkor 50mm 1.8 -----> AI !!!
