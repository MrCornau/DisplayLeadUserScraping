According to historians of the brand, it was huge hit. But, optically, it was not very good...and once zooms became commonplace, the original 43-86 came to be known as one of Nikon's *worst* lenses.\n\nNikon improved the lens markedly with a 1976 redesign. The revised optical formula was carried over to the [AI model of 1979](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/nikkoresources/zoomsMF/4386mm1.htm), which is the version that is subject of this post.\n\nAs [Bj\u00f8rn R\u00f8rslett](http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_zoom_02.html#MF43-86) writes, the new version, although much improved over the original, could not overcome its horrendous reputation. But I've always been curious about this lens, and I finally decided to acquire a sample. It's the one pictured here. I bought it on eBay for $39 plus shipping.\n\nSo, how is it? It's actually not that bad! I quite like it.\n\nFirst, the lens is a very handy size. It's a push-pull zoom that extends with increasing focal length. At the minimum of 43mm, it's about the same length as the AF-S Nikkor 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G when that lens is at its shortest\u2014but *much* slimmer. Zooming in to 86mm adds less than an inch to the length. The weight of the two lenses is almost the same; but the 43-86, being much more compact, is much denser, and this translates to feeling of impressive heft in the hand. It balances very nicely when mounted on my FX body.\n\nThe ergonomics of the lens are excellent. It's a one-touch design: the same ring controls focus by turning, and focal length by sliding. The focus action is second to none\u2014the feel is wonderfully slick, yet well-damped; and there is *zero* play in the helicoids. The sliding zoom action feels similarly luxurious. And the aperture ring on this lens is the best I have ever used. The detentes are impossibly clicky and positive; they emit a wonderful \"snick-snick\" sound as you turn the ring.\n\nNow, optically, the lens is a far cry from the objective (pun intended!) perfection of the latest $2K pro zooms. Wide open, the uneven field curvature and undercorrected coma of the design is quite apparent. At f/3.5 the image center is only a bit soft, but IQ degrades significantly about halfway out to the edges before coming back a little at the extremes. There's not a *lot* of the dreamy glow that some other old Nikkors (such as the 50mm f/1.2 and the 35mm f/1.4) are well known for, but there is an indefinable, unique quality to images shot wide open that I'm quite partial to. [Here is an example involving breakfast](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1938/45272479482_94c0c57f15_o.jpg), taken at 86mm and f/3.5.\n\nStop down to f/8, though, and the lens produces uniformly sharp images with good contrast. Check out this [photo of a fine-dining restaurant](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1904/45272478192_5081ede991_o.jpg), taken at f/8 (also at 86mm). Examine it at 100% magnification on a 4K display: do you really need a sharper image than that?\n\nMany, if not most, shooters balk at the idea of a 2x zoom range that begins at the odd-duck focal length of 43mm and ends at 86mm: it's far too long at the short end, or doesn't go far enough on the long. What good is such a range for? Well, if you don't think of the lens as an alternative to a 24-70, but instead think of it as a normal lens and a portrait lens in one, you might find it useful after all. I know I do.\n\nDon't let this lens's junk-like price dissuade you from giving it a try. Admittedly, I'm a bargain-glass fetishist whose most expensive lens *was* an AF-S 24-120mm f/4G\u2014before I sold it to support my manual-focus addiction. Not exactly a high-end lens. So, I'm accustomed to working with\u2014even cherishing\u2014old, imperfect gear. There are those who would think it morally offensive, or at best just childish, to waste time putting a $40 piece of shitty glass on an FX body...and they're right! But who cares.

I'm interested in getting some feedback, and sharing my experiences so far.\n\nA downside of of an IR conversion is that the resolution and light sensitivity of the camera is significantly reduced; the bayer filter blocks IR light to the green and blue pixels, effectively reducing resolution and light capture to 1/4 of the sensors original capabilities when paired with an IR passing filter.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to [de-bayer](https://petapixel.com/2013/08/04/scratching-the-color-filter-array-layer-off-a-dslr-sensor-for-sharper-bw-photos/) the image sensor, effectively converting the camera to true B&amp;W.\n\nThis process has the side-effects of dramatically increasing light gathering ability and eliminating the need to interpolate data from multiple pixels to re-construct a full resolution image.\n\nOur victim is a D70. This camera is a good candidate for two reasons:\n\n1. It's cheap\n2. The CCD sensor is much more sensitive to IR light than a CMOS sensor\n\n[Here's a photo album of my first surgery attempt](https://imgur.com/a/KGHOo). Gore warning; people who are sensitive to camera abuse should avert their eyes. When the robots overthrow humanity, they will punish me for this.\n\nI've made my first attempt at converting my D70. Unfortunately, the end result of the process was a non-functional camera. Afterwords, when I take a photo the camera reports that the 'CF card cannot be used.' Test images taken before the surgery display fine, however new photos are not written. The camera reports no other errors.\n\nThis appears to be a commonly reported problem with the D70 cameras, however it was working before I pulled the body apart, and I find it much more likely that I damaged the sensor rather than that I simply induced a write problem.\n\nPossible ways I could have damaged the camera:\n\n1. Too much heat while removing protective glass over CCD\n2. Too aggressive while removing bayer filter; damaged sensor electronics\n3. Use of alcohol to clean sensor\n4. Assembly / disassembly mistake\n5. CF card reader was boarder-line and failed during the operation (thanks /u/HerbertTarlek)\n\nI learned a few important things in this process:\n\n1. Next time, I should reassemble and test the camera after each step of the modification process.\n2. Next time I should be less aggressive with bayer removal; leave edges and test camera.\n2.

The focus ring has a little mechanical resistance, almost as if it needs lubrication, and makes a bit of a dragging noise when rotated. It still is very precise and probably the best I've ever used.

At f/4 it does just about as well as my 35mm, if not a little softer.

I tried the 1.4 on my D5300 and quickly realized that while I loved the bigger aperture and smooth focus ring it will not meter with my camera. I haven't been able to try the metering on the FM or the F100 with the 1.4. I'm just wondering if it will at least meter with my F100? if not will the FM meter with the 1.8?
