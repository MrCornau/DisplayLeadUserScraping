It just saves a jpg (80% compression) copy of current image (if saved is selected) next to the original RAW (not all formats supported jet!)\n\nThe program actually **doesn't delete** any of your photos, but rather moves them into one of the subfolders: \"/save\", \"/delete\" or \"/autodeleted\"\n\nPlease let me know if you find a bug, have features that you'd want me to add or just if you liked it!\n\nHope that I can help some of you to finally take on the massive task of decluttering your hard drive from bad photos =)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ezevp9/quickly_organize_10000_photos_tip/"}, {"autor": "giuliomagnifico", "date": "2020-12-29 19:10:07", "content": "Blink-----> AI !!!  world\u2019s first -----> AI !!! -powered \u2018Night Mode\u2019 for video (Xiaomi Mi 11)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/kmkod2/blinkai_worlds_first_aipowered_night_mode_for/"}, {"autor": "pooooosldbgicsb", "date": "2020-11-22 21:28:17", "content": "Be my tester &amp; find more photo shoot spots /!/ Hi I\u2019m a student who is looking for beta testers to try the app I have been working on throughout 2020.

Change my mind. /!/ So a few days ago I've had an interesting conversation with a fellow photographer, from which I know that he shoots and edits on mobile. He recently started with \"astro photography\",  however, since I was wondering how he managed to take such detailed astro pictures like these on a smartphone camera, it looked kinda odd an out of place. I've taken a closer look and noticed that one of his pictures (taken at a different location) seems to have the exact same sky and clouds as the one he's taken a week before. Photo editing obviously. I asked him about it, and asked which software he used, turns out he had nearly no experience in photo editing, and used an automatic AI editing software on mobile. I don't blame him for knowing nothing about editing, that's okay, his decision. But I'm worried about the tools he's using, automatic photo editing designed with the intention to turn everything into a \"professional photo\" with the click of a button. I know that at first it seems to open up more possibilities for people with a creative mind without photoshop talents, however I think it doesn't. It might give them a headstart for a few designs and ideas, but these complex AI features are limited, and without photoshop (with endless possibilities) you'll end up running out of options, using the same AI design over and over (at least till the next update of the editor lol). And additionally, why'd these lazy creative minds (most cretive people are lazy, stop denying that fact) even bother to learn photoshop, if they have their filters? Effortless one tap editing kills the motivation to actually learn using photoshop, it keeps many people from expanding their horizons. And second, what's the point in giving a broad community of people these \"special\" possibilities? If all these pictures are edited with the same filters and algorithms by everyone, there'd actually be nothing special about their art anymore, it'd all be based on the same set of automatic filters and algorithms. \n\nThis topic is in fact the same moral as the movie \"The Incredibles\" wanted to tell us, \n\nQuote: \"when everyone is super, no one will be\"\n\nI hope y'all understand my point, any interesting different opinions on this topic are very welcome in the comment section below...", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/kacr83/ai_photo_editing_kills_photographic_talents/"}, {"autor": "apk71", "date": "2020-12-27 15:45:37", "content": "NR and Sharpening software. /!/ I have been using the NIK suite (DFine2 and Sharpener Pro 3) though Lightroom for years.

I live on a relatively small island so seascapes, landscapes etc are abundant.  Anyway I have been feeling that I have exhausted all the spots on my island, visiting them throughout the years in different seasons, different light, times of day to get the best shots of the area.\n\nBut as of late, really since the beginning of the year it just doesn't seem to be cutting it anymore, I feel like its rinse and repeat, over and over again and since my other work has been slow since wedding have been cancelled and my other part time job I only work 10 hours a week it has got me into somewhat of a rut.\n\nI was looking back at my first few years of photographs from around 15-18 years ago, shooting on film, self developing and they all have such a quality to them, I look at them and I see this story, of my friends and I, hanging out, life growing up and it suddenly felt that I don't have this emotional connection with any of my current landscape images, my newer work or any photographs I have taken in the last 3-5 years.  \n\nI stopping picking up my camera, no clients and no desire to get out shooting so I just stopped.  This went on for a few weeks and I began to pick up my older DSLR and film camera and just casually shooting a couple of weeks ago, not really paying much attention but just trying to have fun, I watched a few youtube videos earlier this week and I began to think about what photography really meant to me.  I wanted to meditate on this idea and get some thoughts down on paper, this is what I wrote:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018What does photography mean to me?\u00a0 Looking back at the beginning of my photography journey I\u2019m not sure if it is nostalgia or just the great (but not always) memories but everything (the photographs) seem to have a more of a magical sparkle to them.\u00a0 Things are just too easy now, I have every variable available to me at all times in post production that it seems to be a wish-list of skills and looks that is just rinse and repeat, image after image.*\n\n*Not photograph after photograph, these digital recreations of time is but a digital fingerprint of where I have been and what I have seen.\u00a0 Emptiness, lifeless landscape image with nobody to share them with.\u00a0 They only become photographs either when I print them to bring them into the physical world, or when that moment of capture is shared with somebody else.*\n\n*I have been a slave to the digital realm, focusing on sharpness, colour, micro-contrast, focus stacking, exposure bracketing, like seeking nothingness and it has not made me any happier, I think far from it.\u00a0 And has it moulded me into an inferior photography?*\n\n*Maybe\u2026*\n\n*Digital darkroom, photographic enhancement, luminosity masks and -----> AI !!!  algorithms to stitch 120 megapixel monsters, pointless.\u00a0 Look at me, I have the latest PANIKONY MK7ii with XY2 lens and every other accessory available to man.\u00a0 But it is ok to use these, the question is should I?*\n\n*The landscapes I create used to mean so much to me finding perfection everywhere I go, the best light, composition, what filters, how to process and it all very well said and done, I have learnt many skills along the way, but at what sacrifice?\u00a0 To no longer look at the world with fresh eyes, but just to see a look, a feed, no story soul or meaning.*\n\n*I want to narrow my focus, and that focus has to be relevant and have meaning, at least to me.\u00a0 It is all about the story after all isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 To narrow my focus on the things that really mean something to me, my friends, family and life.\u00a0 Adventure is everywhere, I feel like I was in such a rush to quit Funky (old job) and have time, that I quit more than that job when I left.\u00a0 My work ethic has changed inside me, my fuel and fire has dwindled as I have had more opportunities.*\n\n*Is it because I feel I must suffer to succeed, No.\u00a0 But I need to be challenged, to be inquisitive, to be interested.\u00a0 Maybe if I was more interested in my own landscape images then somebody else would be too.\u00a0 I think thats why I made them, for others to look at, but I\u2019m still not sure what they see when they look at them.\u00a0 There is no story or meaning to them and I\u2019m not sure if just beauty is enough.*\n\n*Im not sure that this is a moment of self doubt, nut more the lines of realisation that a photographer can be whoever they want to be.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to fit into genres or follow trends.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to create new trends or even bring back old ones.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to be bold and think big, they don\u2019t need to be perfect and have all the answers.\u00a0 I think the only thing a photographer needs is the passion to tell a story.\u00a0 And I think it's time I carried on telling the only story I know.\u00a0 Mine.\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt like this really challenged my beliefs on what I was trying to do and get out of my images, where I wanted to see them and question who I was really pleasing.  Myself, a random person, or another photographer.  I think that its important to take steps back and re-evaluate whats happening in your photographic journey at whatever skill level you might be at.\n\nIt has led me to believe that I am just not that bothered about landscapes anymore and I don't really want to carry on pursuing them.  I am going back to older projects and coming up with new ideas of projects I want to do in the future to create the work that really means something to me.  \n\nIf you are relatively new to photography I think you should ask yourself what kind of images would you like to look back on in 20 years, what will tell that story for you.  If you are picking up a camera just to get likes and follow trends then you might just be wasting your time, and money.\n\nIf you are an experienced photographer I ask you this; \n\nWhat does photography mean to you and what are your goals or projects you are working on that captivates you over long periods of time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a follow up video about my journal entry the next day which is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XktF0GMqFgQ) if you want to check it out.\n\nAnd I also made a blog post discussing the same thoughts and ideas behind my struggles with storytelling in photography [here](https://www.luismoraisphoto.com/blog/my-struggles-with-storytelling-in-photography) if you want to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and have a great day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuis", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/go1awk/struggling_with_storytelling_in_photography/"}, {"autor": "HI_CoBE", "date": "2020-05-29 05:43:14", "content": "UH Hilo CoBE data science students use -----> machine learning !!!  to predict college completion /!/ [removed]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/gsmy1n/uh_hilo_cobe_data_science_students_use_machine/"}, {"autor": "a5s_s7r", "date": "2020-05-28 11:37:15", "content": "Review Workflow for small team /!/ Hi,\n\nwe are a small company (6 people) with a lot of photos and media to handle.\n\nWe use Catpure One, Ligthroom and Photoshop to edit our photos, also have a lot of grahic designs as -----> AI !!!  and EPS files.\n\nI am looking for a solution to do following workflow:\n\n* culling, taging and first editing\n* have a possibility to do a review for 1 or 2 team members. should be definable somehow who can do it\n* should be able to have user groups to limit who can see which gallery/image. photos can be mixed private and work related.\n* tagging manual and based on an AI would be great\n* running internally on our server\n* should not break the bank\n\nLightroome would do most of it, but only on one working place, but we need to have a browser based solution as we have team members working from home.\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/gs4nrb/review_workflow_for_small_team/"}, {"autor": "zxrooo", "date": "2020-06-22 23:24:56", "content": "Check out this new -----> Ai !!!  - ran Twitter account that posts photos..", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/he39yd/check_out_this_new_ai_ran_twitter_account_that/"}, {"autor": "cheesylasagne69", "date": "2020-06-26 20:16:46", "content": "This insane Youtuber uses neural networks (-----> ML !!! ) to upscale a B&amp;W era of George Eastman level (video)photography.

Review /!/ So I\u2019ve been researching complimentary and competitive software to Adobe\u2019s Lightroom ever since they\u2019d shifted their model from perpetual licensing to subscriptions. I\u2019d recently run across an article that compared Lightroom to a newer software from Skylum called Luminar 4 and Luminar AI, which was being designed to use neural networking strategies to develop images.\n\nFrom what I had read, not only was Luminar comparable to LR\u2019s range of tools, the interface and learning curves were much better to get into. It offers a faster editing process compared to Lightroom, making it seem much more appealing. The AI capabilities that were touted in the reviews seemed to make it sound extremely impressive, especially being able to add solar rays or replace skies more easily. Heck, Jim Nix was even sponsoring Luminar 4 in recent videos to show off how to make his photography really pop!\n\nWhat everyone failed to mention, however, was the mediocre programming and processing capabilities of Luminar 4, in my opinion. Not only is it not a stable platform to work with, it\u2019s endeavors to introduce simplicity and ease of use created shortcuts that cut corners and ultimately led to an inferior product. \n\n\nI\u2019d downloaded the pair of software applications to try out and gauge if it met my needs. In the three says I\u2019ve worked with it, I was left with the following impressions:\n- The main claims made about Luminar 4 and Luminar AI were that it was made to create faster post processing possible. This was offset by how often the application would crash, making all of the work put into it much MORE time consuming than using an alternative application!\n- The automated features such as the solar rays and sky replacement were a nice touch that I thought would be useful in the long run, especially dealing with mundane tasks like ray tracing, atmospheric effects, and so on. While these features sound great, I found that each felt out of place in the trial photographs I\u2019d tested these tools with. The sky replacements felt out of place in the images, sometimes creating more issues trying to blend the replacement sky into the original image. The solar rays were too high luminosity too early on the slider, making adjustments (and their advanced adjustments) poorly scale.\n- RAW file formats, while supported, too a lot of memory to run. I\u2019d found that while using my RAW library, my 16GB RAM was 40% idle and 90%+ while handling things such as multiple adjustment layers or running a luminosity mask. This often led to multiple crashes just prepping an image for layered adjustments!\n- One of my largest concerns was that edits were being made on the original files instead of the program creating a copy of the image it was editing. Instead, I\u2019d found that while trying to avoid any edits to the original image before exporting, the image libraries and the image you work on were being preallocated to memory while the software was running. This was an issue when I was dealing with access to a portion of my image library\u2014 well over the capacity of my computer\u2019s RAM. Supposedly, the image thumbnails are supposed to use a compression method to avoid any issues; however, I found that this was not necessarily the case and that the abundance of images in the library was overwhelming the software.\n- Since you\u2019re limited to one version of your image, the only way to preview multiple versions was to create duplicates of the same image for as many revisions to the style or tone of the image as I would need. This was a feature that I sorely wished they would have added in (multiple virtual images with various styles); however, due to the memory issues, I doubt it would have made their customers happy.\n- Lastly, working on large volumes of photos requires a strong and stable foundation of building profiles or masks that can be applied to a whole range of similar photos. I felt that Luminar lacks the stability to really handle a typical day out. Due to consistently crashing, I was not able to get through a single album of photos in the time I\u2019d set aside to do so, making it all the more frustrating trying to work with a product that didn\u2019t want to work with me.\n\nOverall, I felt like the hype for AI driven technologies was what led to Skylum\u2019s rise in popularity. The issue is that they were trying to reinvent the wheel and do too many things to really make a comparable or competitive product in today\u2019s market.\n\nOpen-source applications felt more stable and had more features that make them competitive software applications. My main post process tool, RawTherapee, had a comprehensive list of available tools and features with a moderate learning curve. While it misses out on adjustment layers and masking, the software itself is ideal for large volumes of batch processing and individual edits. GIMP similarly feels like it has more community support and documentation than what Skylum has produced. Google Snapseed\u2014 used for mobile RAW processing and spot post-processing\u2014 feels easier to use. And while despite being limited to working on individual photos, I feel like it\u2019s an excellent example of how to simplify post processing to streamline for faster methods.\n\nAll in all, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed with Skylum\u2019s current products. I hope to see their software grow and develop to fulfill their goals, I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re there yet.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/kessqx/luminar_4_ai_review/"}, {"autor": "EagleFly_5", "date": "2020-10-28 18:51:21", "content": "Is Artificial Intelligence Destroying Art? | Fstoppers (discussing Luminar -----> AI !!!  + modern editing practices in photography/film + videos/tv shows) (29m57s long video)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jjttjw/is_artificial_intelligence_destroying_art/"}, {"autor": "OnlyProggingForFun", "date": "2020-11-07 13:23:10", "content": "This -----> AI !!!  can Colorize your Black &amp; White Photos with Full Photorealistic Renders!

This is a guide I wrote to analog feature accounts on Instagram. I know there are a lot of useless hashtags out there, and I wanted to highlight some feature accounts that might be a good start for film photographers who are interesting in finding inspiring work and sharing their own with the IG community. \n\nThis list is in no way meant to be exhaustive, as that would be impossible, but for those of you who are starting out with film photography and wondering how to share your work, there are a number of accounts that have their own hashtags, and mostly feature photos that are tagged with those hashtags. There are so many of these accounts that it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell them apart, so part of why I wanted to write this is to help demystify their differences.\n\nSome of these accounts are legitimate print outlets, though some of them just exist on Instagram. Some of them \u2013 particularly the larger accounts \u2013 may not rely on hashtags for discovering work at all, even though it seems like they do. Your mileage may vary, and to be honest, it\u2019s sometimes a popularity contest, especially with accounts that have more than 200k followers. But other photographers may follow these hashtags and discover your work as a result.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of crossover with these accounts. You\u2019ll see certain photos and photographers that are featured on multiple accounts, which is I guess the film photography version of going viral. You know the kind of photos I\u2019m talking about \u2013 the kind that are peppered throughout Instagram\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section, or the ones that hit the top of [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/). The kind that win contests. The ones that make you wish that you too were a master of nailing exposure and stumbling across (or creating) scenes that take your breath away.\n\nAnyways, here\u2019s a rough guide to curated feature accounts, sorted by the size of their follower-base. Instagram pages are linked. As a disclaimer, I think that curation is more important than popularity, and some of the smaller ones are run by people who are more involved in the analog community. Most of them are focused on film photography, but they\u2019re not all exclusively analog. Some featured photos just have a film \u201cvibe\u201d or aesthetic, which may annoy some people here. Lastly, these are just my opinions. This is a subjective guide. I'm not an expert -- I'm just a fan.\n\nOne thing I want to say is that you should **NEVER PAY FOR FEATURES**. I know it's tempting, everybody wants to get their work seen, but these accounts are popular because of other people's work. If anything, they should pay YOU for the use of your photography. I haven't mentioned certain accounts here because of this.\n\nAnyways...\n\n**\\~ \\~ A LIST OF FILM PHOTOGRAPHY FEATURE ACCOUNTS \\~ \\~**\n\n[**Somewhere Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/somewheremagazine/) **(#somewheremagazine) (861k followers)**\n\nSomewhere Magazine is one of the larger accounts out there. There\u2019s a nice mixture of cinematic scenes and more abstract lens-based art on this page, and it lives up to its claim of being a \u201cmood board\u201d.\n\n[**Film Wave**](https://www.instagram.com/film.wave/) **(#filmwave) (275k)**\n\nThis account has a tendency to post photos that are in some ways related to the act of analog photography in a meta kind of way. You\u2019ll find analog self portraits, photos of cameras, etc. on here. There\u2019s obviously more to their curation than that, as it is a large account with a large fanbase, but if you have a beautifully shot gear pic, this might be the account for you to tag.\n\n[**Nowhere Diary**](https://www.instagram.com/nowherediary/) **(#nowherediary) (257k)**\n\nLots of night scenes and foggy, moody photography. Lots of beautiful, empty scenes with no people in them, though some photos do feature people. What I like about this account is their tendency to pair some of their posts with lengthy written blurbs about photography. They have a series of Nowhere Diary Legend posts where they introduce their audience to famous photographers, which is a cool way to find out about significant photographers if you\u2019re new to photography and/or less plugged in to the historical side of things.\n\n[**Film Photographic**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotographic/) **(#filmphotographic) (204k)**\n\nOne of the founders and curators is Jason Lee, which is cool. Also a gallery and book publisher. There\u2019s an emphasis on more rural scenes here and landscapes. Many of the photos are people-less, which I like. I\u2019m not sure how active it is, but it\u2019s maybe worth checking out.\n\n[**If You Leave**](https://www.instagram.com/ifyouleavestagram/) **(#ifyouleave) (152k)**\n\nBig M O O D. Cinematic pics out the wazoo. Even the name is dramatic. This account has been around since 2009, before certain film cameras started costing more than cars. I like their curation.\n\n[**Film Photo Mag**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotomag/) **(#filmphotomag) (137k)**\n\nThere seems to be an emphasis on grainy photos on this page, some of which are underexposed (but who cares!). Moody stuff. Lots of cities, lots of silhouettes. That kind of thing.\n\n[**Tainted Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/taintedmag/) **(#taintedmag) (9k)**\n\nLots of fine art portraiture, sometimes of famous people. The curation seems to favor innovative poses and composition that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a fancy MFA program. Think Ryan McGinley, or someone whose work is more abstract than that. The photos here look like they could be in NY Mag or the NYT magazine. Or a museum, really.\n\n[**Film Shooters Collective**](https://www.instagram.com/filmshooterscollective/) **(#heyfsc) (80k)**\n\nThis account has been around for quite some time, and you\u2019ll notice that some of their curation highlights photos that embrace the imperfections of film. By this, I mean photos shot on expired film, or photos with light leaks. If you like double exposures, this might be a good hashtag for you to use.\n\n[**Photo Filmy**](https://www.instagram.com/photo.filmy/) **(#photofilmy) (74k)**\n\nThere tends to be a focus on geometrically-pleasing images here. Lots of beautiful old buildings, some Americana-influenced stuff. There\u2019s an interesting mix of curation here, and a number of the photos are densely layered.\n\n[**Ain't\u2013Bad**](https://www.instagram.com/aintbad/) **(#aintbad) (70k)**\n\nThis is less of a feature account and more of a real-assed magazine/publisher. There\u2019s more of an emphasis here on body of work (photo essays, photo books) than singles, which I really like because a cohesive body of work is what eventually sets you apart from the kind of photographers who just take pretty pictures.\n\n*NOTE: I found out after writing this that there are some* ***serious underlying issues with -----> Ai !!! n\u2019t Bad***\\*, which you can find out about on Instagram. Notably, they have failed to support people of color and lack diversity in their programming. There are also accusations of sexual assault that have been brought up against people involved with Ain\u2019t Bad. It\u2019s\\* ***really*** *disappointing and disheartening to read about because I\u2019ve found some great photographers through their site. Consider not using this hashtag.*\n\n[**Back 2 the Base**](https://www.instagram.com/back2thebase/) **(#back2thebase) (44k)**\n\nA mixture of Ian Howorth-esque emptiness, portraiture, and street photography. Quite artsy. I like their logo.\n\n[**Drive By Film**](https://www.instagram.com/drivebyfilm/) **(#drivebyfilm) (31k)**\n\nSpoiler alert: there are a lot of beautiful cars on this account\u2019s page, along with some gas stations, and a little bit of night work. It seems to be very focused on American scenes, though to be fair, so are many other accounts.\n\n[**Restore from Backup**](https://www.instagram.com/restorefrombackup/) **(#restorefrombackup) (31k)**\n\nI\u2019m biased in my love for this account because they\u2019ve shared my photography on multiple occasions (and more than other feature accounts have), but they place a really high value on community-building, and in that way it\u2019s like a mixture of [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/) and [r/analogcommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/analogcommunity/). From what I can tell it\u2019s run by good people who don\u2019t have a superiority complex about photography. They also do a nice job of showcasing work from smaller accounts.\n\n[**Burbs on Film**](https://www.instagram.com/burbsonfilm/) **(#burbsonfilm) (26k)**\n\nThere are plenty of photos of suburbs on this page, but they\u2019re not exclusively shot in suburban settings. A number of these photographs subvert traditional stereotypes of the United States, though some are pretty straightforward in their scope. Lots of these photos feel like they\u2019re from another era.\n\n[**Make Me See Mag**](https://www.instagram.com/makemeseemag/) **(#makemeseemag) (24k)**\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed with the photos that this account features is that they mostly feature photographs that have a dynamic subject that your eye zeroes in on immediately. There\u2019s a little bit of flash photography thrown into the mix, which is nice. The curation is pretty varied and some of the photos are shot in quite innovative ways. It\u2019s a great account that deserves a larger following.\n\n[**The Film Stead**](https://www.instagram.com/thefilmstead/) **(#thefilmstead) (11k)**\n\nSoothing, beautiful photography with a focus on architecture and landscapes. In a world where so many photographs are moody and dark, it\u2019s nice to see photos that have a happier, more positive vibe.\n\n\\-----\n\n**Accounts with less than 10k followers that might be worth your time:**\n\n[**Every Day Rural America**](https://www.instagram.com/everydayruralamerica/) **(#everydayruralamerica) (6k)**\n\n[**Rural Exposures**](https://www.instagram.com/ruralexposures/) **(#ruralexposures) (6k)**\n\n[**The Film Renaissance**](https://www.instagram.com/thefilmrenaissance/) **(#thefilmrenaissance) (5k)**\n\n[**Film Leaders**](https://www.instagram.com/filmleaders/) **(#filmleaders) (4k)**\n\n[**Observation Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/observationmag/) **(#observationmag) (3k)**\n\n[**Seasoned Film**](https://www.instagram.com/seasonedfilm/) **(#seasonedfilm) (2k)**\n\n[**Analog Drive**](https://www.instagram.com/analogdrive/) **(#analogdrivemag) (1.5k)**\n\nFeel free to post more accounts that you like in the comments, or share your thoughts on these accounts.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not involved with running any of these accounts.

Her mum accidently took her birth photos on a used film, which damage them. I couldn't find much on how to go about this (A link for a reddit post in this sub has someone asking how to do this and the comments say either repaint the whole image or wait for someone to make an -----> AI !!!  in the future), so I thought I'd make a few posts for peoples searches.\n\n**My Background**\n\nI consider myself to be a novice at photoshop but have gained some experience over the years. This project was well beyond my ability. I thought I was going to have to admit defeat a few times.\n\n**Techniques I Used To Fix A Double Exposed Photo:**\n\n1. Collect all the data you can. other photos of the day, photos of the subjects at similar angles.\n2. Take good parts from other photos and blend them on to your main photo. I cut the better parts out, resized them on the main photo and then used the erase tool with a feathered edge/low hardness value to do this.\n3. Use content aware fill (Selecting source information from multiple photos if needed) to create and fix what you don't have.\n4. Use smudge tools lightly if you need to blend shapes or other outlines format the second exposure where content aware fails.\n5. Adjust and fix colours\n6. Make sure you save at every major stop along the way. My final piece was version 18 and took 4 days.\n\n**Image and Process Link**\n\nIf it interests you or you are t=thinking about trying to achieve this yourself, I have used YouTube to show my (Screen recorded and explained) process (Includes Before and After).\n\nWarning: I made this as a full YouTube video, so it could be considered self promotion.
