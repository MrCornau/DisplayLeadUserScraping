I like the combination of the slightly slower zooms along with the two primes for low light and bokeh, but I would lie if the higher end Tamron G2 zooms and SP primes (or Sigma art primes for that matter) don't look mighty fine.

The zooms mentioned above are absolutely fine for most of the situations I find myself in; in fact the Tamron is the sharpest lens I've ever used. The primes, however, are coming out at the concerts. I caught myself wishing for a 35mm in some cases where I couldn't get the entire band in the frame though. Based on my exposures of 1/60-1/100s., F/1.8 and ISO 3200, I've calculated that the light at the venues is at 3 ev or thereabout. And the files only really look good in black &amp; white because of the noise. \n\nNow, while the outside portraits in natural light and the low light performance at ISO 3200 are better with the 5D, the t2i produces very crisp pictures in the studio with speedlights which is the only time I really use it. \n\nThe 5D is adequate for most of the photography that I do, but there are a few features I'd love to have that it doesn't provide: AFMA for the Canon lenses would be great, and I wouldn't mind a bump in resolution either. The center AF point and recompose method is fine for most situations, but tracking the neighbour's dog in motion is pretty tough in -----> AI !!! -servo, although doable given enough light and patience. Eye-AF would of course also be very welcome. \n\nWatching some of Richard Barleys videos on youtube has helped me stick with what I have, but of course I'm thinking about upgrading, and the posts with all the new mirrorless cameras with eye AF and 20 fps are fueling my GAS. But taking a step back, and looking at what I feel is limiting about the 5D, I've come to the following things a body upgrade would solve:\n\nA simple upgrade to the 5D mk II would give me AFMA and vastly higher resolution. It would also help with the 3 second delay when I want to chimp! ISO 6400 would also allow me to use the F4 zooms in more situations, although I expect that it would still be best in black &amp; white. \n\nThe 6D has gone down in price to match the 5D mk II on the second hand market at ~3000 kr. ($490), while beating it at  except weather sealing? This makes it a pretty attractive upgrade in my opinion. \n\nThis doesn't provide an upgrade in AF as such, so for that I would need to look at the 5D mk III or 6D mk II, which are going for at least twice the price of the above two options (&gt;6000 kr. or &gt;$980), unless severely used, patinaed and with very high shuttercounts. At that point I'd rather save up more and go for an EOS R, RP or perhaps look at switching systems to Fuji or Sony, which brings me to the following thoughts:\n\nA second hand EOS R + adapter  (~11000 kr. ($1795)) would by far be the easiest, as I wouldn't have to sell the old lenses and buy new ones (except perhaps the sexy rf 35 F1.8). The benefits of the mirrorless bodies without the need to sell and buy new lenses would honestly be amazing. \n\nFuji would present  a world of very nice lenses made specifically for crop sensors, and the X-T3 goes for the same as the 5D mk III now! The faster than usual, stabilized, variable aperture zooms and the F2 primes in this system seem to be of very high quality and very fairly priced. The optical quality of their F2.8 zooms seems to be lacking behind taking their price and the offerings in other systems into consideration perhaps. \n\nThe A7III is at the same second hand price point as the EOS R. The Sony system has some very nice FF zoom options from Tamron, taking advantage of the IBIS. I honestly don't see many arguments against this system, except for the hassle and expense of exchanging the lenses. \n\nAs for Sony crop, they are almost none-existing on the second hand market, except for the A6000. The price of a brand new a6600 is the same as a used a7III, so a brand new a6400 would be the only attractive choice, as it costs the same as the used 5D mk III and X-T3 mentioned above. The 17-70 F2.8 from Tamron is by all means a very attractive lens along with the Sigma 1.4 primes, but the lack of a dedicated F4ish stabilized aps-c telezoom makes the quite expensive FF 70-200 F4 G the only option here as far as I know. The a6600 would at least permit the use of the FF Tamron 70-180 F2.8 with its IBIS. \n\nI haven't considered Nikon, Panasonic, Olympus ans Pentax as I can only handle so much information at once before becoming completely overwhelmed by choice paralysis haha. \n\nSo yeah, I think perhaps I should just sell the 5D classic + t2i and get a 6D.

Before that I owned a 5D Mark 1 and a 30D. \n\n**Why I'm looking:**\n\nThe above has worked well for me over the years but is now struggling to do what I want - particularly with the arrival of a young dog who loves to run around. The 6D really struggles to keep him in focus and I miss more shots than I nail. I'm frustrated. \n\nThat's not the only reason I'm thinking of a move... mirrorless seems more and more popular, the 6D is quite an old body now and I've been eying up what the likes of the Sony A7 III can do and wishing mine came close (if only it was ergonomically pleasant to hold!). It's also a bulky system to carry around (particularly with multiple lenses) so a more compact system is attractive. \n\n**My options:** \n\nI'm looking at going mirrorless and the Canon R / RP both have drawbacks I feel I can't ignore, leaving me the supremely expensive Canon R6 as an option. It's a superb camera, but \u00a32,500 here in the UK and it's still a big / bulky system to carry for my daily dog walks. \n\nThis leads me to Fuji, whose XT-4 looks good and certainly cheaper... but at the sacrifice of full-frame and of course a complete ecosystem shift. \n\nOn top of my dog I also shoot events / music festivals which can involve some low-light work, so lack of noise is another thing I look for and I know FF generally helps there, plus there's the general FF 'feel'. It's been a while since I shot anything on a smaller sensor barring my phone, where -----> AI !!!  does a lot of the work.\n\nSo...\n\nHas anyone found themselves in a similar situation? \n\nI feel like I could buy a more complete Fuji system for a lot less than Canon - particularly if I have to look at R-mount lenses going forward as Canon is slowing/stopping production of some EF glass. \n\nBut I already have some EF glass and know Canon well, the R6 is a fantastic camera but it's *very* expensive for an enthusiast (I've done some paid work, wouldn't claim to be a professional though) and it's also bulky.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/mzlvuk/current_canon_6d_mk_1_owner_considering_an/"}, {"autor": "Candlefoot", "date": "2021-05-12 13:40:09", "content": "Can't get my Canon EOS 1300D to auto-focus without holding down the shutter button /!/ I'm using my Canon EOS 1300D as a webcam through EOS Webcam Utility, and it works fine, but I can't get it to auto-focus without holding down the shutter, is there a way to do this?

In order to be as to-the-point as possible, I'm going to try to be brief.\n\n**Background**\n\n* Pet \"photographer\" - unpaid - I do this to help family and friends (in the United States).\n* I am a camera and photography novice - explain it to me like I am 5.\n* My camera is exclusively used to take photos of pets - 99% cats - at close range (2 to 6 feet).\n* I try to use artificial lighting as much as possible to help get better pictures.\n* Camera is used daily.\n\n**Previous Equipment**\n\n* I was using a Canon EOS 70D with a Canon EFS 18-135mm lens (macro 0.39m/1.3ft).  \n* I have been using this camera daily for pet pictures for about 10 years.  \n* I believe that it's broken (it's throwing a bunch of errors and making odd noises).  \n* The pictures that I took were \"OK\" quality.  I used Photoshop to lighten and sharpen the images just about every time.  I am fully willing to accept that this may be due to inexperience/operator error.  I am overwhelmed by all of the technical terms in photography.  I bought a Dummies book specific to this camera but found that I need the book for those people that are 1 step below \"dummy\".\n\nI am looking at replacing my camera with a Canon EOS R6.  From what I've been able to tell from the reviews, mirrorless is the way of the future, this is a good middle-to-high end camera, and I'm hoping that the eye/animal face recognition -----> AI !!!  will help me in what I do (pet pictures).  \n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Am I on the right track with the Canon EOS R6?  It's a lot of money but I'm willing to spend it if it helps me to take great pictures.\n2. What lens would you recommend?  I want to take a mix of close-up face shots and full body shots, mostly of domestic house cats, from 2 to 6 feet away.  These are posed pictures - not impromptu pictures of cats around the house.  Of course, animals don't always cooperate and hold poses.  The numbers and letters on the lenses, zoom, macro, prime, focal length - it's as complicated as the camera!\n\n**Budget**\n\n* I understand that the Canon EOS R6 is \\~$2,500 USD.  I got over the sticker shock last night (it wasn't easy).\n* I was hoping to keep the lens under $1,000 USD, but if there's a lens out there that will guaranty near perfect pictures each and every time, I'd be willing to spend more.  I know that this is an exaggeration but you know what I mean.\n\nThank you in advance for analyzing my situation and providing feedback.  I'm overwhelmed and I really do appreciate it.  My only other option is to walk into a camera store and go with whatever the clerk behind the counter recommends - not a likely recipe for success.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/nuhv3r/equipment_advice_canon_eos_r6_for_pet_photography/"}, {"autor": "Lumpy-Studio", "date": "2021-06-06 05:20:09", "content": "EF 70-200 F4 IS continuous noise with R6. Why? /!/ I upgraded from an 80D to an EOS R6 just recently and I'm loving it. Picture quality and out-of-camera colour is way better; low light performance is jaw dropping; the -----> AI !!!  eye autofocus is superb; the controls fall more comfortably to my hands; and that I can still use my EF lenses equally well if not better made it an easy upgrade. I have no RF lenses \u2014it'll be a while to recover from the cost of the body before I can think about that.\n\nBut when I attach an EF 70-200mm F4L, the IS continuously grumbles away for as long as the R6 is on. On the 80D it's just as noisy, but only for a little while after the shutter is half cocked, then it parks itself. It's definitely the IS making the noise. It goes away if I flip IS 'OFF' on the lens. It doesn't affect  my EF 24-70 F4L IS, or my 35mm F2 IS. Or if it does, the motors are so much quieter that I can't hear them.\n\nWhy does it do that? Is there some need for that behaviour? Because if not, it's going to eat the batteries unless I keep turning the camera off. Are Canon going to fix this? Or is it maybe an unsubtle hint to invest in some RF glass? Which would be a pity, because EF glass is plenty good enough for me and I was hoping to pick up more on the secondhand market ...", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/ntect7/ef_70200_f4_is_continuous_noise_with_r6_why/"}, {"autor": "tungvu256", "date": "2021-07-10 12:08:43", "content": "Good software with -----> AI !!!  for editing? /!/ What windows program are you using with AI to enhance photos with?
