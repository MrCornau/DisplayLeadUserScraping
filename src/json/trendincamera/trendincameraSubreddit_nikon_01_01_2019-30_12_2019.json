In particular I am looking for 35mm, 50mm, 85mm (and some really long lengths).\n\nI have seen a comparison between the 20mm AF and the 20mm AF-S. Are there similar comparisons between other lenses? Is there a general trend? Is it worth investing in the more expensive AF-S gear?\n\nBy the way: I have the D7500 and two AI-S lenses but I cannot meter with them which is annoying. So I am looking into AF lenses.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/au6i0l/af_vs_afsvs_ais_lenses/"}, {"autor": "WasteWonder", "date": "2019-12-12 13:44:54", "content": "Milan Central Station [D7200 / 28mm -----> AI !!! -s / F/2.8]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/e9nqid/milan_central_station_d7200_28mm_ais_f28/"}, {"autor": "StingrayB8er", "date": "2019-07-04 23:47:09", "content": "The only digital Nikon camera that comes fully compatible with every -----> Ai !!! , AF, AF-S, AF-P and E-type lens is the d500. /!/ The D850 may require a firmware update to be compatible with AF-P.
