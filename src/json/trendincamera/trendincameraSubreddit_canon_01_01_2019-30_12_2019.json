Go to setup is my 6D2 and Sigma Art 50mm. My standard AF setting is OVF with center 9 points, either -----> AI !!!  Servo or Single shot. The number of bad focus/missed focus shots is close to zero.

Obviously the sentimental value is incredible, but it still functions and I'd like to start using it more.  The only issue is the autofocus.  Right now the only lens I have for it is a Sigma DL Zoom 35-80 1:4-5.6, which has an AF/M selector switch on it.  I followed the instructions in the manual to turn on the autofocus (press the AF button, use the wheel to select \"One Shot\" or \"-----> AI !!!  Servo\") but it seems like nothing is happening.  I assume that when I half-depress the shutter button it should suddenly focus something, but so far it does nothing (I've deliberately pointed it at out of focus things to see if they would focus, but nothing happened).  Obviously I know how to manually focus but there isn't anything in the viewfinder to let me know if it's precise (like one of those split circles).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any chance that this is just the lens and that buying a canon lens would possible solve this (I want to get a 50mm soon), or is something wrong with the camera altogether?
