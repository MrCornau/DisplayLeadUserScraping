My newest fascination is anamorphic portraits and landscapes. I've been doing lots of research but I was hoping some of the pro's could offer some real-life advice on what I should expect. I've done a fair amount of reading across the web and on /r/anamorphic but maybe there's something that you've encounter that's not been brought up.\n\n.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n\nI'm selling my Gen 1 Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 to finance this project (will upgrade that lens at a later date).\nI'm using an already-owned Nikon D810 with (eventually) a [nikon 85mm f/2 -----> AI !!! -S](https://kenrockwell.com/nikon/85f2ais.htm) . Then I plan on using an Isco (either mini or not) 2x anamorphic lens on top of that, preferably with a screw-less attachment system. \n\nFrom what I can tell, that would be all I needed to get started. Am I wrong?\n\nSo here are my questions...\n\n1) Can I practically use this setup handheld? Is it sturdy enough to walk around with or should I only attach the Isco when I'm ready to use it? I've seen some complex follow-focus setups with custom tripod mounts that seem really daunting.\n\n2) How convenient are the single-focus systems? They are roughly another $500 investment to implement. Does it save that much time? It seems like an overklll purchase for stills but I can see why for video it would be really great for workflow.\n\n3) Because anamorphic lenses really shine at wide-open apertures, is it worth investing in a screw-on filter mount for the front-end? \n\n4) Am I being an idiot for not just buying a flare filter and letterboxing my images in post?\n\nThanks ya'll. I'm excited to try this but I'd love any advice you can offer.

This is actually longer than I expected so ... thanks if you read it, even a bit.\n\nSome context clarification, this is a [fansign](https://youtu.be/80AlcdW3FoM?t=1m19s), this is a [fanmeeting](https://youtu.be/25ioUx_whlg?t=5s), and well, dance performance and concert are pretty self explanatory.\n\n_____\n\n    **[TUTORIAL] CAMERA GEARING GUIDE FOR K-POP \u2013 BASIC NOTIONS BEFORE BUYING (PART 1/3)**\n\nThis is the first part of different tutorials on camera gearing for K-Pop related uses. I\u2019ll start by focusing on the different notions that you have to know to understand the settings and the features of a camera. This will help you decide which camera might be the one for you, and how to use it.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not a specialist, but I have done a lot of research to get my stuff, and I\u2019ve made mistakes by the past, so I\u2019m here to help you guys avoid those.\n\n    Camera gear vocabulary\n\n* DSLR: This term is used to point at the bulky black camera you usually see. Those are the most commons I would say, and you usually can detect them by the distinct sounds they make when taking a picture. We can also call a camera, a body.\n \n* Mirrorless: A camera is considered mirrorless when it got \u2026 no mirror. This is the thing that makes the sound and take the picture in a DSLR. In a mirrorless system, everything is dealt with electronics. They are smaller in general, feel less tough, but image quality wise, no major difference with DSLRs.\n \n* Full Frame: Regardless of body type, a camera is also distinguished by its sensor. The full frame type got the biggest sensor for the SLR fragment. Full frame sensors are usually seen in high end cameras.\n \n* APS-C: This kind of camera got a smaller sensor than a full frame one. A coefficient is usually used to get the full frame equivalent (x1.6 for Canon and x1.5 for Nikon and Sony, meaning a full frame sensor is 1.6 bigger than the Canon APS-C one). Most of entry level and mid-level cameras are using APS-C sensors. The kind of sensors will have mainly impacts on two things:\n \n * Light: there will be more luminosity gathered in a full frame camera. More light = better picture. For instance, a lens that has a f-stop of f/2.8, will have an equivalent of f/4 on an APS-C body. (2.8 * 1.6 = 4.5). Using the same lens will have different results depending on the camera used, solely based on sensor size.\n * Range: at the same distance, when looking at something, the aps-c user will get a tighten view. It means, that if the full frame user wants to get the view of the APS-C user, he\u2019s gonna have to move forward quite a bit. This is why people are reffering to different range on APS-C sometimes, for instance, a 70-200mm lens is gonna have an equivalent of 112-320mm for APS-C user. However, all the lenses range are based on full frame, even the ones only compatible for APS-C.\n\n* MFT: For micro four third, or 4/3, is another type of sensor which is twice smaller than one of a full frame, so the crop factor (ratio) is x2. It\u2019s a sensor usually seen in mirrorless cameras. I will not talk much about those because they are lacking in low light which is needed for K-Pop in general.\n \n* kitLens: This white thing on the picture, is a lens. This is what you need to attach to the body so it can capture photos. The quality of a photo will depend on the lens first, then on the camera. This is why, if you have to invest in one thing, it\u2019s the lens.\n\n* Focal lenght: This is the range of a lens basically. The higher the number, the closer you can look at something without moving. As a point of comparison, the human eye got a range of around 42mm.\n\n* Zoom lens: When a lens got a variety of focal lenght, it\u2019s a zoom lens, it means that it can go from one range to another.\n \n* Prime lens: Or fixed range, is to determine a lens that can\u2019t change its range \u2026 There are pros and cons to use either prime or zoom tho \u2026 I would recommend zoom because of versatility.\n \n* Aperture: It\u2019s the opening inside a lens that let the light go through. A big aperture (or wide to be precise) will let through more light. The aperture can also be called f-stop, and is mentionned on the lens by \u201cf/xx\u201d, xx being a number. You can have lenses with fixed aperture (ex: f/2.8) or variable aperture (ex: f/3.5-5.6). The lower the number, the bigger the aperture. A wide aperture lens tend to be more expensive as light is a very important feature in photography.\n \n* Image stabilization: This is a feature on lens (and on mirrorless bodies) that appease the natural shake of your hands when taking pictures, this is very interesting feature, because if you don\u2019t have it, you are gonna have to increase the shutter speed to compensate, so less light.\n\n* Shutter count: This is the number of shots a camera can take before being subject to failure, it\u2019s some kind of approximate lifespan. Most DSLRs got between 100 000 and 150 000. It doesn\u2019t mean that it gonna stop working once this number is reached, just that it\u2019s most likely to fail than a new one. If you are buying used gear, you have to check for this. (high shutter count = lower price)\n\n* Viewfinder: It\u2019s where you put your eye to see through the lens. You also have a diopter close to it, that you can adjust to see more clearly. (so people with glasses can shoot without them), since the diopter will simulate the correction of the glasses.\n \n* Liveview: There is a button dedicated to activate that, it\u2019s so you can view through the lens on the back screen of the camera instead of the viewfinder. Certain features of your camera will change when it\u2019s in liveview (for instance, the Canon 1DX Mark II got 16fps in liveview compared to the usual 14fps).\n \n\n         Camera settings vocabulary\n\n* ISO: This is the light sensitivity. When you go up, the image get brighter, but noise increase as well. So, it\u2019s about finding the compromise. We call base ISO, the lowest your camera can go, in a lot of photo dslr, it\u2019s 100.\n \n* White balance: It\u2019s the colors of the photo, expressed with numbers. Go toward 0 and the photo get colder, more blue-ish, go toward 9999, and the photo get warmer, more reddish. It\u2019s a camera settings that you shouldn\u2019t bother too much about, it can easily be changed afterward in post process.\n \n* Shutter speed: It\u2019s the time the sensor of the camera stays open to capture the light. The longer it stays, the more light it captures, but since it doesn\u2019t stop time \u2026 if things move (enough) during the trigger, things can get blurry. So, the settings have to be different depending on what the subject is doing. Dance performance ? It has to be faster, so you can freeze the moment like this. You can see that the hair is not blurry, so the speed was appropriate. However, in this picture, Chaeyeon wasn\u2019t moving fast enough so it\u2019s ok, but Heehyeon\u2019s hand was faster, so it appears blurry. To avoid confusion, 1\u2032 is one second, 1/30 is one thirthyth of a second, and 1/400 is one four hundredth of a second,so 1/30 is longer than 1/400.\n \n* RAW: Like the name suggest, this is the pure file without any kind of alteration. A raw file will have a lot of information saved within it, so it will be easier to process later on. However, because of all the data, a raw file is heavier. I suggest you to capture Raw in any case.\n \n* Focus: It\u2019s pretty self explanatory, the focus is when you target an element so that your camera know what to shoot, and your target appears sharp. For instance, in this picture, I focused on Yoohyeon so she appears more sharp than Sua, who is more blurry. It\u2019s very important to hit your focus right, otherwise, it will ruin your pictures. In general, put your target in the middle of the screen, with experience, you can direct the focus with precision.\n \n* Focus mode: In a camera, you have different mode to what you want to capture, moving subject or still subject ? Either way, I would suggest you to choose the moving subject focus mode, called -----> AI !!!  Servo on Canon and AF-C on Nikon (I don\u2019t know about others).\n \n* Framerate: or FPS is the frame per seconds in which you record a video. 30FPS, 60FPS, 120FPS, etc. This will impact the smoothness of a video. You need at least 24FPS so the eye can track and understand motions, lower and it will look ugly as fuck. 60FPS is a sweet spot for dance performance. Here is a comparison, the 60FPS of God dancing, and the not-60FPS video of God dancing, so yeah, the 60FPS looks smoother but not all cameras can do that.\n \n* For photos, the FPS refers to the speed you can take pictures in a chain (also called FPS continuous shooting), for instance, this dude is showing the speed of his camera. As a reference the Canon 80D got 7fps which is good.\n \n* Buffer size: This is the numbers of photos you can take before your camera slow down. (for Sony, they stopped entirely, waiting) The photos have to write themselves on the storage, and this take some times, thus this buffer size notion. It depends on the speed of your camera and the memory card used. You can shoot longer depending on the file chosen (since jpeg file weight less). Here is an example of a guy filling the buffer size on his 80D. Something along 10/15 for Raw is quite standard, higher end cameras can shoot longer.\n \n* Bitrate: This is a number that defines the flow of data when recording a video. The higher the number, the higher the data, consider this data as details. So, if the video has a high bitrate like 100 MBps (megabytes per second), the video will be more detailled, better quality. High bitrate = high storage needed.\n\n\n           Photo vocabulary\n\n* Noise: When a picture looks grainy, it\u2019s noise\u2026 This thing appears when it\u2019s lacking light in general. Example.\n \n* Sharp: We call a picture sharp when there is no blur, when we can see all details, and everything is pretty and shit. Sharp = clear. Here is a sharp photo of God.\n \n* Soft: When it\u2019s not sharp, it\u2019s soft. It\u2019s usually a bit blurry, it doesn\u2019t mean that the photo is bad but sometimes, softness can\u2019t be avoided because of lens, environment, etc. Here is an example. Soyeon is in focus (more or less\u2026), however, it\u2019s not sharp because of gear and light. Usually, when you want to reduce noise, you introduce softness, it\u2019s about a compromise, how much softness and noise you want in your picture.\n \n* Bokeh: It\u2019s the background blurr, how isolate is your subject from the background. Example. You can see that Qri is sharp but we can\u2019t distinguish the leaves behind her. The bokeh, also related to the notion of depth of field, is affected by the focal lenght, and the aperture.\n\n* Megapixels: This is the resolution of a camera. For instance, 24 megapixels (mpx) is 6000\u00d74000 resolution on a computer. (6000*4000=24M). Usually, something around 20 is more than enough to get good looking pictures. Having higher will allow you to crop better tho, but that comes to a price.\n\n\n        **[TUTORIAL] CAMERA GEARING GUIDE FOR K-POP \u2013 GEAR ADVICES AND RECOMMENDATIONS (PART 2/3)**\n\nIf you are willing to shoot photos or videos of your idols and invest in an appropriate camera gear, this guide will help you decide.\n\nFirst thing is to decide the budget you want to use, then the type of things you want to do (photo, video or both ?). Note: camera gear is really expensive.\n\nIf you want to get pics like the usual fansites, be prepared to invest quite a lot. You often see those Canon white lens ? Well, it costs that much. However, do you need this to get quality photos or videos ? Well, not necessarily, there are alternatives.\n\nI will mostly focus on full frame and APS-C cameras, as MFT and point and shoot cameras are not perfectly suited for K-Pop as you usually need range and low light capabilities, that those two are lacking.\n\nFirst of all, the brand you are choosing, I\u2019m gonna stick to three, as I consider them to be the most suitable for what we shoot.\n\n* Canon:\n * Decent camera bodies, with decent performance in photos and videos\n * Good variety of lenses\n * the most used in general, so easier to get used stuff at good price\n* Nikon:\n * Better camera bodies than Canon, better value at least\n * Lenses are not as good as the Canon counterpart in general\n * Bad for videos because of the focus\n* Sony:\n * recent mirrorless cameras has been really good, for both photos and videos\n * low variety of lens, you can\u2019t go over 200mm easily\n * Lenses are really expensive, but camera bodies are ok\n\nThose are the brands for cameras, they also make their own lenses (native lens), but there are also other brands that can make lenses for those systems, they are called third parties manufacturers. You mostly have to care about Sigma and Tamron as for now.\n\n    General tips\n\n* Used cameras: you have to look for the shutter count.  The higher the shutter count, the lower the price, obviously, but you shouldn\u2019t buy a camera that has a too high count. Under 30 000 would be pretty decent while providing a good discount on the price. If it\u2019s too high, you might have to include the cost of renewing the shutter, but it\u2019s another step and hassle. (cost varies depending on cameras)\n \n* Warranty: we called grey market, any product coming from export (usually asia). Those products are cheaper (even brand new), but if something happens, it\u2019s gonna be harder for you to claim warranty. I would suggest to buy grey market lens but stick to classic market bodies (buy the camera in an approved retailer in your country for instance). Well, the product is the same, so it\u2019s up to you, is the price gap worth it ? Personally, all my gear is grey market.\n \n* Kit lenses: in general, avoid them, I\u2019m talking about the 18-55mm you usually get with your cameras. This lens is gonna be useless for K-pop and the quality is usually bad. I would suggest you to buy a prime lens instead (50mm f/1.8 is a good one, regardless of cameras as each brand got their own affordable option). For K-pop uses, 18-55mm is not enough range in general anyway so you don\u2019t need it. Here is a photo I took using my very first set-up with a 18-55mm. (at 55mm range), and here is the zoomed version. On another hand, here is a picture I took using a Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM on a crop sensor, you can see that I\u2019m lacking a bit of range, but the quality is way better. My advise: buy a 70-200mm instead and get yourself a 35mm or 50mm for wider shoot. (as those primes are usually between 100/200\u20ac so quite affordable.)\n \n* Used lens: a lot of lenses, especially the professional ones are built like tanks so they have quite a long lifespan so it\u2019s quite easy to buy a used lens. However, what you have to check is the state of the glass, is it ok ? Check for fungus  and any defect possible, look from one end and the other, is there dust inside ? Also, try the lens if you can, especially the focus system as it can go off if there is an issue inside.\n* \nAccronyms:\n\n* Image stabilization: it got different names depending on manufacturers:\n * Canon: IS = Image stabilization\n * Nikon: VR = Vibration reduction\n * Sony: OSS = Optical steady shot\n * Sigma: OS = Optical stabilization\n * Tamron: VC = Vibration control\n* Lens format: Full frame and APS-C designed lenses got their names as well:\n * Canon: EF for full frame and EF-S for APS-C\n * Nikon: FX for full frame and DX for APS-C\n * Sony: FE for full frame and E for APS-C\n* Quality indicator: for expensive shits\n * Canon: got an \u201cL\u201d after the aperture to indicate professional oriented lens,\n * Sony: G Master serie\n * Tamron: SP for Super Performance\n * Sigma: A = art, S = sport, C = contempory ; it\u2019s the uses for which the lens was designed for\n * Nikon: I have no fucking idea, they don\u2019t have one I think\nThey are also other accronyms but they are less important I would say.\n\n            What to buy beside camera+lens ?\n\n* Batteries: If you are using a DSLR camera, I would suggest you to buy at least one additionnal battery, because if you are shooting non stop during a fansign, you will end low on battery after 2 hours (talking from experience), so just in case, have some safety measure. Also, get official batteries, the third batteries are cheaper but their lifespan is way shorter. When shooting mirrorless, you might need more because the batteries don\u2019t usually last as long as the DSLR counterparts.\n \n* Battery grip: It\u2019s an accessory that you put at the bottom of you camera that brings 2 things. One, is a slot for another battery, your camera will have 2 batteries in it, so you don\u2019t have to change it during a session. Two, is the ease to shoot vertical photos since they are additional commands on a battery grip. This is why for Dreamcatcher London, all my photos are horizontal, but for Dreamcatcher Amsterdam, I have some vertical shots as I have the grip with me. I would also suggest to get official battery grip since it\u2019s linked to the camera system, but it\u2019s expensive as fuck for what it is, it\u2019s up to you eventually. You can still shoot vertically, it\u2019s just not as convenient.\n \n* Memory cards: depending on your cameras, you might need to use SD cards (most frequent nowadays), Cfast cards or XQD. Check that your computer can read those cards, would be sad if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t forget to get an adapter then. For your memory card, you need something that can handle the storage needed, and the speed. For a lot of cameras, the SD card you want needs to have a UHS-I written on it (or U1), it\u2019s a speed norm that quite some cameras have right now. UHS-II is for high-end cameras, so just ignore as it\u2019s not that common anyway. If you\u2019re planning on shooting non-stop during an event, the memory card is gonna have to be handle more, as a reference, for a fansign of 2 hours, with a Canon 80D (which have a good speed and buffer), I have almost 6000 photos for 150GO. However, this is me and I\u2019m an insane shooter, spamming that fucking button. I would recommend 2 64GO cards or a single 128GO card, this is a good start and should be able to handle all your needs.\n \n* Flashes: Clearly not needed in almost all situations, but it might come handy in some rare situations, like airport or exterior night shooting. Do not use them during dance performance, and fansigns, it\u2019s bad etiquette and you\u2019ll probably be asked to get it off or worse, be kicked. Don\u2019t need to buy an official flash (Canon, Nikon, Sony) as they are too expensive for the uses we have, instead, get a third party one that can be as good, like any Yongnuo one. Flash should be the least of your worry anyway. An example for what flash can bring: Handong after the Amsterdam concert.\n \n* Tripod/monopod: A tripod is a stand for your camera to rest, this is an extremly convenient item and I suggest you to buy one if you can, they are especially useful in fansigns. The tripod will allow you to reduce the shake since you don\u2019t have to carry your camera anymore, and it\u2019s more \u2026 energy friendly, holding a dslr for hours is tiring, believe me. A monopod has the same purpose but it\u2019s on one leg instead, so, less stable as you can\u2019t just leave the camera there, but you\u2019re more mobile so if you have to move, it\u2019s good.\n\n        What do we need for K-Pop ?\n\nMost of K-Pop events can be either outdoor or indoor, so you should stick to the worse scenarios to base your purchase on, which is : indoor and low light. So you need something that can be used in this situation.\n\n* Aperture: f/2.8 is a good aperture in low light without an inconvenient depth of field, so this should be your go to aperture. f/1.8 or f/2 are also good options but those lenses are not as common beside the prime.\n \n* Focal lenght: 70-200mm should be your go-to lens, it\u2019s an extremly versatile focal lenght and should cover a great part of your needs. In very rare situation, where you are really close, a 35mm prime should be great to compensate or a standard zoom (24-70mm). This applies for APS-C as well, but you can find  yourself a bit tight by 70 (as it\u2019s about 110mm full frame equivalent), so a wider lens might be needed, although, in most cases, it\u2019s ok. For the Kard showcase, I was at second line, so very close and the 70-200mm on my crop sensor felt a bit tight sometimes, I couldn\u2019t get a full body shot of Somin when she was in front for instance.\n \n* Extra focal lenght: In some situations, 200mm may not be enough, for instance if your seat is far in a fansign, or during a dance performance. There are two options:\n \n * Extender: It\u2019s something you put between the camera and the lens, they usually increase the range by 1.4 or 2. However, there will be a degradation of the image quality, and if you are using a 1.4 extender, you will lose one stop of ligt (f/2.8 to f/4, f/4 to f/5.6, etc.). The focus speed will also be slower.\n * Another lens\u2026 Sigma 150-600mm , Nikon 200-500mm, Tamron 150-600mm should be the main ones unless you have thousands of euros, then go for prime telefoto lens, but it\u2019s above my knowledge (considering that a lens can go over 6000\u20ac so \u2026).\n\n* ISO performance: You are gonna need a camera that can get a maximum ISO of at least 6400, because in dark environment (concert room for instance), you\u2019re gonna reach that maximum\u2026\n \n* Video: Something that can film 1080p at 60FPS is a sweet spot, most cameras can do 1080p 30fps so it should be fine, but if you\u2019re aiming to get fancams, over photos, 60fps is needed. Unless you go 4k 30fps, but getting into 4K is more expensive.\n\n        Camera Bodies recommendations\n\nI will focus most likely on APS-C and full frame bodies, and all the price will be new and grey market, and without the kit lens. So you\u2019re gonna have to adjust the price for your country if don\u2019t want grey market (add something like 20/25%).

If it does, you will have some serious quality drop so, is it worth it ?\n\nThe lenses I recommend, all prices will be new, and grey market, so you might notice some differences, and buying a lens used isn\u2019t an issue at all: (sorted from cheaper to out of mind)\n\n* Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM:\n * 150\u20ac (Only get the STM version, the previous ones are dipshit)\n * insane value for the buck and very good range overall\n * only compatible with Canon APS-C cameras\n \n* Tamron SP 70-300 f/4-5.6 Di VC USD: \n * 260\u20ac\n * Good range and value for its price\n * In either Canon, Nikon or Sony version (+30\u20ac)\n\n* Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6 ED VR:\n * 230\u20ac\n * Good range and value, although more expensive than the Canon counterpart\n * Only for Nikon APS-C\n\n* Tamron 100-400mm f/4.5-6.3 Di VC USD: \n * 570\u20ac\n * Good range overall, with decent quality and value\n * it\u2019s lacking indoor because of the aperture but at this price point, not much possible at this range\n\n* Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 Di VC USD (also called G1 or A009): \n * 680\u20ac (Do not get the macro version, it\u2019s utter bullshit)\n * good value, good performance\n * compatible with either Canon, Nikon or Sony\n\n* Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM C:\n * 700\u20ac\n * Long telefoto lens, very good value for the range it can reach\n * It shouldn\u2019t be used for under 300mm, you should just get a 70-200mm instead\n * in either Canon or Nikon mount\n\n* Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 (A025):\n * 1000\u20ac\n * good value, performance is almost equal to the native lens\n * in either Canon or Nikon edition\n\n* Nikon 200-500 f/5.6E ED VR:\n * 1000\u20ac\n * Good value, with good focus overall\n * fixed aperture, nice on a long range telefoto lens\n\n* Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM II:\n * 1400\u20ac\n * worse value than the tamron one, but better at long range and slightly faster focus speed\n * the classic white lens you see everywhere\n\n* Sony FE 70-200 f/4 GM OSS: \n * 1400\u20ac\n * The cheap alternative for Sony xD\n * Lens is good despite the f/4\n\n* Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6L IS USM II: \n * 1500\u20ac\n * good range, ok value, image quality is not as good as the 70-200 f/2.8 but compensate with the extra range\n * because of the aperture, it kinda sucks in low light, but it should do ok in fansigns and outdoor fanmeeting\n\n* Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 ED VR II: \n * 1700\u20ac\n * Nikon native lens for this range, all the previous version are obsolete compared to the tamron version\n * worse value than the tamron one for not an actual better option but if you want proprietaire option, it\u2019s this one\n\n* Canon EF 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6L IS USM:\n * 1700\u20ac\n * It\u2019s an extremly versatile lens, but at the cost of image quality, but at least, you won\u2019t need any other lens. It\u2019s still an L lens, so quality is enough in most situation.\n * The wide end is very so-so\n\n* Sony FE 70-200mm f/2.8 GM OSS:\n * 2000\u20ac\n * not much possibilities with Sony cameras, lens is excellent though\n\n* Sony FE 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 GM OSS: \n * 2200\u20ac\n * If you want to reach past 200mm, you don\u2019t have much choice with Sony\n\n* Sigma 120-300mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM:\n * 2800\u20ac\n * Really good range, especially at f/2.8\n * really heavy and expensive, and not as sharp as the 70-200mm but image quality is still nice\n * Canon or Nikon option\n\n* Sidenote: For Sony bodies, you can use a converter to get Canon mount lenses on the Sony bodies, you don\u2019t lose much on image quality, but the issue is focus speed as it\u2019s not as reliable, also, it can varies quite a bit from a lens to another. Look for Metabones speedboosters and Sigma converter.\n\n        Tripod recommendations\n\nAnything that that suit all the below characteristic :\n\n* it can reach your eye level while being seated\n* it can withstand twice the weight of your heavier camera set up\n* is aluminium (because cheaper)\n* you shouldn\u2019t go over 150\u20ac, and a lot of good options around 100\u20ac\n\nThe manfrotto befree is quite popular, really light, good enough height, and can support 4KG, which is enough for a 70-200mm set up.\n\nFor anything standing, I would suggest a monopod, some tripod can have some leg converted as a monopod, so, why not. Also, you can just stick to a monopod, instead of a tripod, it\u2019s fine, but I personally like having the option to just leave the camera there. You can also look up for video monopod that can stand on their own but they are quite expensive for the good ones.\n\n    **[TUTORIAL] CAMERA GEARING GUIDE FOR K-POP \u2013 SETTINGS, SHOOTING, AND POST PROCESS (PART 3/3)**\n\nThe last part of the camera tutorials will be focused on settings and to use your cameras for what we need.\n\nFirst of all, go and set the camera on M mode, which is the manual mode.\n\n    Camera settings\n\n* White balance: You should just put it on auto. This is one less thing to worry about, as it can change from a scene to another quite frequently, and since it can be easily corrected in post process, it\u2019s ok.\n \n* ISO: In most cases, you should put it on auto as well, however, you can still tune it a bit. You can set a maximum ISO for the auto mode to reach, the max you set is gonna depend on situation. For the dreamcatcher concert, I set it at 8000 max in Amsterdam, because I got some shots at 10 000 in London, and it was too much. Since in a dance performance, the lights are gonna change a lot, auto iso is necessary. For more calm scene, like, in a fanmeeting or fansign, you can fix the ISO yourself for a better control of the image. However, in a fansign, from one member to another, the light can be different so keep that in mind.\n \n* Exposure composition: it\u2019s the black and white +/- symbol combo, in general, it\u2019s best to have a slightly underexposed picture, so you can go to -0.3 to -1, don\u2019t go too much. Letting it at 0 is also fine, this is not a decisive factor in image quality anyway.\n \n* Shutter Speed: You need something fast enough to freeze the moments (no blurr), and something slow enough to let enough light and limit noise. What I use right now:\n \n * 1/125 for posing idols, where the subject will freeze himself for a shot time\n * 1/200 and 1/250 for talking and reaction capture, slow paced stuff in general\n * 1/400 and 1/640 for dance performance, depending on dance, you can also change it, but for Dreamcatcher for instance, I find those two shutter speeds to be in a sweet spot. The hair are sometimes a bit soft on 1/400, this is why I\u2019m also using 1/640 depending on songs.\n\n* Aperture: Always go to the lowest value possible, it\u2019s especially true with variable aperture lens, as it change depending on the range. It can happen to forget to put it back to the lowest. One exception is that you have a really fast lens (below f/1.8) and you are close enough to the subject, you might want to tune it a bit. But considering that f/2.8 is quite the standard, it shouldn\u2019t happen much.\n \n* File: Shoot Raw in priority, and if you are lacking storage \u2026 yeah, go jpg. If you have two cards slot, one good option is to shoot Raw on main card and jpeg on second card as you have a back up just in case the main card die. However, this will add a strain on the camera so it will be slower (buffer size), so it\u2019s up to you. I personnaly set my second card on overload option as I want to keep my momentum while shooting.\n \n* Focus mode: depending on the camera, try to get the focus mode dedicated to moving subject, this will help you track the subject across your screen more accurately. Also, choose the largest possible area (highest numer of cross focus points) to focus. In mirrorless, you also have face detect and eye detect, those are good options in general. You might want to try the settings yourself to see what suits you the most.\n\n* Button configuration: In general, to get a photo on a fresh camera, you push the trigger halfway, it focuses, then, you fully push and it shoot. What I find more convenient tho is to configure one button to focus, and let the trigger to shoot pictures, regardless of the focus. You have to choose a conveniently placed button (under the thumb ideally), and that is not important in general, and configure it to AF-ON (autofocus on). On my Nikon, it\u2019s the AE-L button that I decided to switch off. Note: you also have to configure it on the battery grip if you have one and the camera settings propose this option.\n \n* Video settings: I would suggest to shoot at least at 1080p 60fps, but if you can, shoot 4K, even if it\u2019s 30fps. When shooting video, you can change the shutter speed to adapt to the record.\n \n * 25fps = 1/50 / 50fps = 1/100\n * 30fps = 1/60 / 60fps = 1/120\n* Then, the bitrate, if your memory card can handle it, choose the higher bitrate everytime. This will put a strain on your memory card, and the post process since the video will weight more, but better have good quality from the start than regretting it later.\n \n* Shooting mode: You can have different modes: single shot, quiet single shot,  continuous high speed, continious low speed, continuous quiet, delay, bulb.

Luminar claims to adjust yo your style so I suppose it could cut down on work needed to get images to have the same feel as others in a set.  \n\n\nThe part of me that loves browsing other peoples work and seeing the personality of each photographer conveyed in their images is worried that this trend will lead to a loss of personal style in images which we already see on platforms like Instagram where you can brows thousands of profiles and see the same colours, the same deep dark greens, and whatever else is trendy at the moment. I do really enjoy the images, but it feels to me like the art of photography is getting lost with more and more tools that promote AI or generic filters and presets that so many people use and leave.  \nI also understand that these tools can help get to a decent starting point for editing but then the editor/photographer can adjust them to make it their own with a bit less effort.  \n\n\nThe other part of me that likes an easy and efficient process sees it as a great way to help professionals cut down on post processing work and help in other aspects of their workflow.  \n\n\nI see the benefit of such tools but I also feel like it could lead to a place where AI will just generate images and people will be passing it off as their work because they pressed a button.  \n\n\nI also know many people will use these tools to help them improve or be more efficient, and probably a large amount of people will not use tools like this because they find joy in making every adjustment or setting reflect their vision for the viewers.  \n\n\nAnyway, what are your thoughts on tools like this and the general trend we are seeing of more and more tools appearing?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9tia69/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_the_trend_of/"}, {"autor": "xinhkxoan", "date": "2018-12-19 10:23:44", "content": "10 C\u00e1ch ch\u1ee5p \u1ea3nh \u0111\u1eb9p n\u00e0y kh\u00f4ng ph\u1ea3i -----> ai !!!  c\u0169ng bi\u1ebft", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/a7l89i/10_c\u00e1ch_ch\u1ee5p_\u1ea3nh_\u0111\u1eb9p_n\u00e0y_kh\u00f4ng_ph\u1ea3i_ai_c\u0169ng_bi\u1ebft/"}, {"autor": "Advantix-man", "date": "2018-12-19 06:08:03", "content": "Nikon -----> AI !!!  to G lens aperture control ring adapter ? /!/ Is there any type of of adapter or something that can be used to allow aperture control of g lenses on older f mount cameras ?

I will redo that portion of the test at some point.\n\n\nOver the years I have gradually amassed quite a collection of lenses which, until now, I have never really taken the time to compare.  So with the recent warm-up I decided to take advantage of the nice weather to systematically test the normal lenses in my collection out of both curiosity and a desire to downsize.  I thought you guys might be interested to see the results.\n\nFor this test I set up a tripod approximately 6ft from the brick wall at the corner of my house with wall taking up the left half of the frame and my yard taking up the right (so as to show both the sharpness and bokeh of each lens). To the best of my ability, I made sure that the plane of focus was parallel to the wall and shot away from the sun.  The cameras used were a D800 (for Nikon -----> Ai !!! , -----> Ai !!! -S, and AF-S lenses, as well as Mamiya 645 lenses) and an a7 II (for everything else).  ISO was set between Low (below 100) and 200, depending on lighting.  The photos were imported using Lightroom and minimal adjustments were made for exposure differences (a few photos were obviously underexposed, probably due to user error).  Because these tests were done over the course of an afternoon, there are changes in lighting due to time of day and cloud cover that should be ignored as much as possible.\n\nThe table of my results is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d8CCxhR3Iuz8GWyyDHuFX_PUVbECOQrqLA2ZaBKSze0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAnd the Flickr album is here:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/139290056@N04/albums/72157664989063267/page1\n\nA shot of all the lenses: https://www.flickr.com/photos/139290056@N04/40270599304/\n\nPlease note that the first result in each row is at the maximum aperture, regardless of what the column title is.

Hopefully some of the info in this post can help people who are interested in doing something like this or just are interested in sports photography in general.\n\nTo start things off this is not my first time shooting sports. I have a lots of experience working as a photographer for my college newspaper where I documented pretty much all the sports teams over four years. So coming into working this camp I was definitely in my element. Secondly I know the sport of Ultimate Frisbee very well. I have been playing the sport for over a decade (I will touch on the importance of this later in the post) and have a good knowledge of how the flow of the game goes.\n\n[Some of my best shots](https://imgur.com/a/pcL8C10)\n\n**My Gear:**\n\nCanon 6D / Canon 5D mk II\n\nTamron 24-70 f/2.8\n\nTamron 150-600 f/5-6.3 G2\n\nYongnuo 85 1.8\n\nUSA Gear Double Camera Harness\n\nDell Inspiron i7, 16gb RAM, 250gb SSD laptop\n\nKingston Multi Card Reader USB 3.0\n\nNew Balance running shoes\n\nMy gear was pretty standard for long form documentation of any sporting event. One body with a wide to medium telephoto (5d mk2 + 24-70) and another body with a super telephoto to capture the downfield action (6D + 150-600). I used a double camera harness off amazon and in retrospect it\u2019s pretty bad. I should have dropped the money to get the Black Rapid harness because the one I used was slightly uncomfortable and needed to be readjusted on a regular basis. While it was bad, it got the job done so I can\u2019t really complain. My laptop is no beast but I could process all my photos with little to no slowdown. Also get a pair of running shoes with good support because standing all day with heavy equipment can wreck your feet.\n\n**How to Capture Sports 101:**\n\nThe most important part of shooting sports is understanding the game. With my experience with Ultimate Frisbee, I knew how the game flowed so I could accurately predict what kind of plays were about to happen. This helped with my positioning around the field as well. I would camp out in the corner of the endzones and alternate from having the disc moving away from to the disc moving towards me. Each approach helped me achieve certain types of photos. The long \u201chail-mary\u201d type plays were easier to capture when the disc was moving towards me while the defensive plays were much easier to catch when the disc was moving away. As a \u201cone man band\u201d I couldn\u2019t possibly capture every exciting moment but putting myself in the right spots and reading the game helped me capture things at a higher percentage.\n\nWhen it came to focal length, shooting at the farthest was the most ideal. With the Tamron 150-600 I stayed around 400-300 because it would be tight enough to be close to the action but also wide enough where I could crop tighter if need be. Most of the time I shoot on shutter priority at 1/1000th with Auto ISO. This guaranteed that I could freeze any motion and seeing as though it was very bright out my ISO never moved past 800. The exception was that once a week the camp had a night game where I moved down to 1/800 so I could get a little more light and ease up on the ISO. Burst mode and -----> AI !!!  Servo mode for AF were a necessity for this kind of shooting. Back button autofocus also made it much easier to pre-focus on an area and then track subjects when needed. For the more detailed and close up shots I would have my 24-70 at my hip mostly locked at 24mm. This was important because if two kids were having a laugh or the counselors were giving advice to a camper I could quickly pull up my wide angle and snap a few shots before the moment went away. I would mostly keep this at 2.8 and a relatively high shutter speed. Some famous photographer said that if your photos suck you probably aren\u2019t close enough. This is possibly the one thing I would want people to get out of this post. With my wide angle shots I was mostly down on the ground and very close to my subject and this raised the level of my photos tremendously. Also with the long telephoto the closer I could get physically to the action, the less compression I got and that would lead to less flat photos. Don\u2019t be afraid to get down and dirty to get a shot, by the end of the day my clothes were covered in dirt and grass just from being on the ground so much. With that being said, prepare for the work that you will be doing later. I would delete any photo that I thought would not be a keeper. Missed, focus, boring moment, generally uninteresting were all reasons for me to delete a photo. Instead of having to go through hundreds of photos at the end of the night, I would have a few dozen of photos that I knew were good enough. I did a lot of \u201cchimping\u201d while out at the fields so I could save time in processing later.\n\nMy philosophy for what photos to keep was basically \u201cdid it encapsulate the atmosphere of the camp?\u201d Sometimes the best plays or highlights don\u2019t show what the camp is actually like. I would take a lot of photos of just the kids laughing or all around being happy. Focus on the fun moments and also the exciting moments for a good balance. Get to know the campers as well because then it makes them feel more comfortable around you. Find the personal moments because those are the ones that really show what the camp atmosphere is all about. One aspect of the photography that I tried to focus on was keep the photos aesthetically simple. The background is just as important as the foreground. Even an out of focus cluttered background will make a good shot look bad. Search out clean and simple backgrounds for your photos because it makes the subject standout.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\nSince it was my job to not just document the action on the field but to capture off field activities as well, I was working pretty much all day with little time for breaks. The most important piece of advice from me in this regard would be to shoot JPEG. Not only did it save me a lot of time importing and processing, I could focus on getting the exposure correct in camera so I wouldn\u2019t need to spend lots of time correcting lazy mistakes after the fact. Also Canon JPEG have enough latitude that most exposure imperfections could be fixed with a few adjustments of the slider. Whenever I was not obligated to be somewhere taking photos I would be ingesting all my photos onto my laptop to be processed. If I had time I would process the photos and the importance of getting the exposure right in camera was that all I really had to do was crop most of the keepers. Learning Lightroom\u2019s shortcuts will make your processing so much faster. Cropping, tagging, and copying/pasting settings becomes so much faster when all you have to do is press a key combo.\n\n**Final Thoughts:\n**\nThis was probably the most fun I have ever had working a job. They say if you like what you do that you\u2019ll never work a day in your life. While the hours were long and the constant work stressed me out, I had a smile on my face the whole time. I recommend everyone try to get involved with some kind of summer camp or after school activity because seeing the kids so happy to see your photos was something I\u2019ll remember for a long time. At the end of the day it\u2019s all about showing what the camp is about and enjoying and experiencing it firsthand will only let you do your job better.

I feel like I've gotten better over the last few years, but a recent community rejection (I won't say which) has sort of set off my anxiety/self-doubt reflex. Usually I'm able to just bounce back--my 9-5 is in the creative/marketing industry, so I'm no stranger to rejection. I don't understand why this rejection happened (I was asked to \"apply to join\" this group so I kinda felt set up...), but can only assume, as no specific reason was given, that there's a lack of something in my work.\n\n**I'm not fishing for compliments-- I'm trying to solve this problem** (that's what I do) of not even knowing what is wrong with my photos in general, or my methodology (as much as can be evident in my photos). I don't feel like a single-image critique has gotten me far (in fact I've submitted to /r/photocritique under a different username in the past). The criticisms were pretty subjective, rather than objective.\n\nThe conundrum in all of this is: *I don't know what the \"problem\" truly is and what way to even go about rectifying it.*\n\nMost of my work has been for clients from my 9-5 who've needed, however I've done some outside projects as well. \n\n[a small sampling of what I've done since 2014](https://imgur.com/a/fmXF6)\n\n**I'm happy to give a little history of my workflow also:**\n\nI've been shooting since high school. University took me into strictly graphic design and into the real world in 2007. But photo, in hindsight, might have been a better avenue to go down. I had been shooting casually all up until 2013 when I left film behind for good. 2014 is when I decided not to be afraid of lighting--I somehow believed only in natural light --facepalm-- for every type of photography. I rented a lot, since they were client gigs. I finally got my own rig in 2015/16 and have been using that ever since. My first actual client gig was the Foundry posts in that gallery link above. It was very seat-of-the-pants. Slowly I learned to get better with my tools--helped when I had my own stuff to use.\n\nAs a matter of course, I don't like retouching--I can do it alright, but it feels dishonest. I do edit, but as little as possible. I feel like I can get some decent workable results from Lightroom. I don't want to be a slave to it, but I often wonder if I can push it more.\n\nI've watched numerous online courses, (tried to) listen to youtubers, just to make sure my books weren't woefully behind the times. I follow people whose work I've seen and admire. In our office there are two photographers, and I've been doing my best to \"not suck\" as a person toward them, as Don Giannatti said [in this article](https://petapixel.com/2014/11/12/aspiring-professional-photographers-problem-suck) .\n\nMy gear--various Nikon bodies and lenses rented, but here's what I own as of 2018:\n* Nikon D700\n* Nikkor lenses: 35mm f/2 D; 50mm f/1,8 -----> Ai !!! ; 85mm f/1,8 G; 105mm f/2,5 -----> Ai !!!

Missed, focus, boring moment, generally uninteresting were all reasons for me to delete a photo. Instead of having to go through hundreds of photos at the end of the night, I would have a few dozen of photos that I knew were good enough. I did a lot of \u201cchimping\u201d while out at the fields so I could save time in processing later.\n\nMy philosophy for what photos to keep was basically \u201cdid it encapsulate the atmosphere of the camp?\u201d Sometimes the best plays or highlights don\u2019t show what the camp is actually like. I would take a lot of photos of just the kids laughing or all around being happy. Focus on the fun moments and also the exciting moments for a good balance.  Get to know the campers as well because then it makes them feel more comfortable around you.  Find the personal moments because those are the ones that really show what the camp atmosphere is all about. One aspect of the photography that I tried to focus on was keep the photos aesthetically simple. The background is just as important as the foreground. Even an out of focus cluttered background will make a good shot look bad. Search out clean and simple backgrounds for your photos because it makes the subject standout.  \n\n**Workflow:**\n\nSince it was my job to not just document the action on the field but to capture off field activities as well, I was working pretty much all day with little time for breaks. The most important piece of advice from me in this regard would be to shoot JPEG. Not only did it save me a lot of time importing and processing, I could focus on getting the exposure correct in camera so I wouldn\u2019t need to spend lots of time correcting lazy mistakes after the fact. Also Canon JPEG have enough latitude that most exposure imperfections could be fixed with a few adjustments of the slider. Whenever I was not obligated to be somewhere taking photos I would be ingesting all my photos onto my laptop to be processed. If I had time I would process the photos and the importance of getting the exposure right in camera was that all I really had to do was crop most of the keepers. Learning Lightroom\u2019s shortcuts will make your processing so much faster. Cropping, tagging, and copying/pasting settings becomes so much faster when all you have to do is press a key combo.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis was probably the most fun I have ever had working a job. They say if you like what you do that you\u2019ll never work a day in your life. While the hours were long and the constant work stressed me out, I had a smile on my face the whole time. I recommend everyone try to get involved with some kind of summer camp or after school activity because seeing the kids so happy to see your photos was something I\u2019ll remember for a long time. At the end of the day it\u2019s all about showing what the camp is about and enjoying and experiencing it firsthand will only let you do your job better.

The mark ii has what canon wants to consider a \u201csophisticated\u201d AF system but I just haven\u2019t seen those results yet. I can take like 10 frames per second and have some look really cool but if i wasn\u2019t already focused on the dog before it starts running, i can\u2019t seem to get it to focus in motion and i\u2019m just simply not quick enough to manual focus on something like that yet.

Shooting in P, S, A and M mode possible. \n- Obviously no Autofocus with -----> AI !!! -s lenses, metering available. Shooting in M and A mode possible. \n\nUnfortunately a compatibility chart from Nikon doesn't seem to be available now and there seem to be some quirks on how metering with Ai-s lenses works. The FTZ Adaptor has no aperture feeling lever on the outside of the F-Mount but can set the aperture via a lever inside the mount (this is how all Nikon lenses except for the AF-E work). Metering is done the moment you press the shutter, but I wonder how that works when shooting in manual. Does anyone of you know that?\nAnother question I have is the electronic rangefinder, which seems to be availabe only with AF-S, E and AF-D lenses.

I've done a lot of soccer, basketball, and baseball, but I just transferred to a new school and have been doing football for the first time. After my first game, my cheap but trusty EF90-300 f/3.5-5.6 shit the bed and I decided to replace it with a used first gen EF70-200 f/2.8L to get that sweet sweet bokeh and a better build quality. But after my first football game with that lens, I ran into lots of autofocus problems. \n\nI figured since I was moving to a larger aperture, I might have problems with the autofocus would hit slightly off. However, when my camera got the focus, it usually hit it spot-on. What I really ended up having a problem with was my camera not focusing on what was directly in front of me and instead focusing on the background or mid-ground. Normally with my old lens after a shot or two the autofocus would get with the program and focus on what I wanted. But after I got back from the game, I had whole series or 5 or 7 images, all of which were focused on the wrong thing. \n\nAnyone have any ideas of how to circumvent this? I'm shooting on a 5D Classic, -----> AI !!!  Servo, and back button focus. I believe I've got all autofocus points activated, but I'm thinking about maybe moving to center-only. I don't think I've ever used the joystick on the back to select a focus point manually, but if you think that would solve my problem, do you have any suggestions on how you use it when you shoot? Especially since my thumb is being used for back button focus. Any and all advice and anecdotes are appreciated!\n\nTL;DR: 5D Classic, 70-200 f/2.8L, shooting football, missing focus like hell", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9kdkb9/sports_and_autofocus_at_wide_apertures/"}, {"autor": "bnm777", "date": "2018-10-13 11:05:34", "content": "Anyone else impressed by the software gigapixel that increases photo size by creating new pixels using -----> AI !!! ? /!/ Saw a description of it on luminous-landscape and have been playing with the trial. \nApparently it uses AI/machine learning (from analysing a million or whatever images) to analyse your image, then add pixels to blow it up by 600%.\n\nHere's a test I performed.

Here is my progress. /!/ Hello,\n\nI am frustrated at the lack of good weather data in this day and age of connected cameras and sensors etc. So I am making projects to assimilate and analyze sources of data that could be used in weather forecasting but are not yet. An obvious one is photos outside.\n\nI'm starting with a simpler target, which is: using labelled photos of the sky, can we train a machine-learning algorithm to do basic classification on the weather conditions on the photo. For example, in a photo of the sky with clouds, and at the bottom trees and roofs, if those items are tagged in the photo then the algorithm can learn about future photos.\n\nA stretch goal is to use all photos taken outside, even if they don't include the sky in them - ground conditions, shadows, etc will all give clues as to the weather outside at the time the photo was taken.\n\nI have asked the -----> machine learning !!!  communities what they think and they deem the basic premise of auto-tagging the photos do-able. The main issue, of course, is finding or creating a large enough training data set for this to work.\n\nSo that's where I am now. I'm estimated to need maybe a few thousand tagged photos of sky conditions at a minimum to begin work on the training algorithm. To that end and others, I've made an Android app that lets people send in tagged photos of the sky. So far I've only collected around 30 photos - and the labeling is dubious. \n\nThe app I made for this is called [All Clear Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android) (US, Android for now, long story, expanding later). The app contains multiple other weather experiments as well not related to photography.\n\nClosing Thoughts and final points\n\n----\n\nI'm not sure I made a wise decision making a weather app that contains this small photography feature to use. I think it will be under-utilized. Is there interest in the photography community to contribute something like this? Should I make a separate app for you?\n\n----\n\nIt occurs to me that smartphone cameras are getting much better year over year. What kind of sensory/light details am I missing from smartphone pictures that might resolve features in the sky if a more advanced camera were used? Are smartphone cameras technically capable of more or less than I'm hoping? I'm thinking about things like [this article on cosmic rays](https://gizmodo.com/turn-your-smartphone-into-a-particle-detector-for-cosmi-1697286872), showing that the cameras can help in scientific research more than people might expect!\n\nThanks!!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9g7aqj/project_my_goal_is_to_turn_every_outdoor_photo/"}, {"autor": "thegeezuss", "date": "2018-10-18 09:58:05", "content": "P\u00edxel 3 vs iPhone Xs camera face-off: the -----> AI !!!  makes a difference", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9p7ub9/p\u00edxel_3_vs_iphone_xs_camera_faceoff_the_ai_makes/"}, {"autor": "suntoryBOSS_", "date": "2018-12-06 00:41:35", "content": "Gear dilemma, what's your thoughts? /!/ So I bought a 6D Mark II from Canon on Black Friday, with the intention of shooting some video with it (I am a photographer first but I want to start making cinematic vlogs/filmswhatever) .

I could sell this camera on my local classifieds and get pretty much what I paid for it back and I was wondering if I should switch to something like a Nikon D610 for photo and maybe buy a 35mm 1.4 ART (I already have -----> AI !!!  lenses) and split that money in half so I can get a dedicated video camera like a panasonic G7 and adapt some -----> AI !!!  lenses I got from my film kit.

After the very first post in 2016, I\u2019ve got a lot of suggestions from redditors and decided to complete another list [104 Photo Editing Tools You Should Know About](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/50613q/104_photo_editing_tools_you_should_know_about/).\n\nThen, Michael Zhang, Petapixel\u2019s Editor, asked me to repost this list on Petapixel. The article got 5,419 shares and tons of comments with a new portion of great tools for photo editing. The next list came with [148 photo editing tools](https://petapixel.com/2016/11/01/148-photo-editing-tools-apps/) Then, ten months after, I\u2019ve published a new list [186 photo editing tools and apps. The biggest list ever existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/72sg6a/186_photo_editing_tools_and_apps_the_biggest_list/).\n\nToday I\u2019m no longer with Photolemur (I\u2019ve left Photolemur a week ago). But I decided to continue doing this research. And the next steps will be putting all this software to the website with filters and user rating option. Actually, I\u2019ve already bought the domain :) [photo-index.com](http://www.photo-index.com)\n\nIf someone of you, redditors wants to help me with building the website - just send me a message.\n\n**What has changed in the new list:**\n\nSome of the apps had gone away from the market (you\u2019ll find them in the list). Also, during my new research, I\u2019ve found that there is almost 100 photo editing mobile apps on the market (in the previous list there were only 31 mobile apps). And I decided to create the separate list of photo editing mobile apps. It will be live very soon! So, there is no mobile apps section in this list. I\u2019ve got a lot of comments about including some kind of recommendations to the list. So, the first 5 to 10 items in each section are the best one (in my personal opinion).\n\nAs always, I want to say thank you, redditors!\n\nIn the beginning, there were only 61 photo tools, and I thought that it\u2019s a huge list!  :)\n\n**Now we have the list of 210 tools for photo editing and photo manipulation (excluding 97 mobile apps)!**\n\n* Enhancers (10)\n* Cross-platform image editors (5)\n* Online photo editors (16)\n* Paid Desktop Photo Editors (26)\n* Free Desktop Photo Editors (14)\n* RAW Processors (21)\n* HDR photo editors (15)\n* Photo viewers and managers (17)\n* Face Editing Software (9)\n* Image Enlargers &amp; Resizing Software (15) ^(new)\n* Photo Utilities, Plugins, Filters &amp; Effects (62)\n\n**Photo Enhancers**\n\n1.[Photolemur](https://photolemur.sjv.io/nLVm6) Fully automated photo enhancement solution to make all photos perfect.
