Is this thing normal? By the way, indicator strip does stop at slightly left of infinity mark, but the physical ring itself will keep turning after that. There of course is a tactile response that indicates a stop but you can rotate past it. I've never owned a G or above(newer) lens so wondering if this is at all normal.\n\nJust to clarify, this is not something I've never seen before, I've bought 35mm f/1.4 -----> AI !!! -S, a much older lens about 8 years ago, used, and it has the same issue, although it's manual, it doesn't focus on infinity at the stop mark but goes past it, exactly like my new nikkor 28 f/1.4E. The difference is 35mm was used and I accepted it as-is, whereas 28mm was bought at retail shop, shiny new.\n\nAnd no, my camera (D700 which is the intended shooting camera for this lens purchase) is not out-of focus as well, because I have other lenses which DO properly focus on infinity upon hitting the stop mark, and those lenses perform consistently on my other older DX camera (D5100) as well, results do look the same(in a way because DX isn't FX but the focus appears exactly the same).\n\nThis 28mm doesn't have a focus issue in auto mode when in A/M mode on either camera. It stops perfectly pointing at the middle of inf sign on an indicator strip, and image looks perfectly focused to infinity at that point. On both D5100 and D700.\n\nSo the problem I have is that I cannot blindly turn the focus ring to infinity and shoot, I'll have to look at the indicator or live view to see the detail, in which case it'll be simplier to never bother switching it to M mode at all.\n\n\nSorry for my potentially broken english, it's not my native.\n\nThanks for the input", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/jyphrt/nikkor_28_f14e_manual_focus_to_infinity_goes_past/"}, {"autor": "ibanez26", "date": "2020-11-21 21:21:42", "content": "Nikon D3, -----> AI !!!  20mm f3.5", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/jyiubl/nikon_d3_ai_20mm_f35/"}, {"autor": "1s_0s_", "date": "2020-02-04 19:52:42", "content": "Winter Trail - D750 - Nikkor 105mm f/2.5 -----> AI !!!

This lens predates the AI aperture ring, and also has a 72mm filter diameter.\n\nPosing this question to long-time Nikon shooters, or even people who have done a DIY AI conversion process on a Pre-AI lens.\n\nI bought a used 20mm f/3.5 Nikkor-UD lens with good glass, and good mechanicals. The only problem is that this particular copy has a improper aperture ring modification. \n\nThe previous owner of my lens attempted to do his own AI conversion by shaving off several mm of the bottom of the aperture ring. Because there was nothing left on the aperture ring to catch onto the aperture coupling ring, the former owner drilled a tiny screw into the aperture ring. \n\nThe problem is that the screw is a few mm off from where it should be for a lens with f/3.5 maximum aperture. When I open this lens to maximum aperture, or even f/4, the screw doesn't catch onto the aperture coupling ring until I stop the lens down to f/5.6. The result is that I can't meter reliably if the lens aperture is opened wide. I think this is a rather serious limitation. \n\nI've thought about what to do about this problem. I've considered working around the problem by using this lens on a Nikon F3 or Nikon F4 with the metering tab flipped up. This method allows me to shoot this lens with stop-down metering. I suppose I could also only use the lens at  f/5.6 or higher, but this is also very limiting. \n\nAs for fixing the problem, I'm not sure if it's worth the time. I've come up with three possible fixes:\n\n1. Re-drill the screw into the right spot\n2. Swap the aperture ring with another one\n3. Find Nikon's specific AI conversion kit, and install that in place of the original aperture ring\n\nI'm not comfortable with the idea of drilling a second hole into the aperture ring, as I have no experience doing so. The second and third options don't seem very feasible either; I would somehow have to find a spare aperture ring for this lens which is unlikely nowadays. The third option is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, because Nikon stopped making the AI conversion kits several decades ago.\n\nAny thoughts on this problem would be greatly appreciated.

Also, suggest me some \"unique\" lenses. /!/ Good evening, \n\nLast year when I upgraded from my D800 to the D850, I splurged for a few nice lenses, mostly to see what else I might dig next to the three I'd been using for close to a decade- 28 1.8G, 50 1.8D, and 85 1.8G. I'd owned other lenses as well, some \"higher end\" (i.e. 135 2DC, 70-200 2.8 VRII), but didn't much care for them, and found I worked best with the three I settled on; they gave me (and continue to give me) years of great use, during which I've captured some of my best shots with them and made a career with their aid. \n\nAnyways, four of the lenses I got last year while experimenting were the 50 1.2 -----> AI !!! -S, 58 1.4G, 105 1.4E ED, and Zeiss 135 2 Apo Sonnar. The 50 1.2 was first to go... superlative build quality, but the rendering was simply not my thing... plus no functional use to me shot wide open... everything so soft. The 105 1.4 which everyone seems to lose their marbles over was next to go. It was a great lens, but- and I'm sure this'll be the only time you ever hear someone say this- it was just too pretty for my liking. Everything I shot on this lens came out perfect... such a silky smooth and bubbly/dream-like aesthetic, making everything look very lifestyle/wedding/portrait- makes sense seeing as it's a portrait lens. And then went the 58, which I actually don't remember a whole lot about other than it giving me some of that 105E prettiness. The Zeiss was the one to stay- that thing is a truly superlative lens in every quantifiable way, and has really spoiled me. I'm looking at some of their other offerings, but am not crazy about the cost, weight, and mf-only. \n\nReason I'm here... I've been looking to shelve my old 50 1.8D permanently, and looking for something ethereal/pretty/bubbly this time, which is why I'm considering revisiting the 58 1.4G. It really does seem like a special lens in what's available from the Nikon and third party F-mount range. I'm just wondering if you're still liking yours? Feel free to share the love for it if you've still got it- or if you don't, share what you replaced it with! I had a Leica APO-Summicron 50 (for M-mount) up until recently which has been touted as the greatest 50 of all time, so am a bit spoiled for 50's in the grand scheme of things, but of course realize that the Nikkor 58 is of a different aesthetic/ethos altogether. It is a strange lens, which I find intriguing... it is a romantic lens, I think. The Leica had a beautiful aesthetic, but could lean stringent if you didn't know what you were doing. \n\nLastly, I'm hoping you lot might be able to suggest me some other unique F-mount lenses to check out. I'm really trying to stray away from the more conventional stuff and want to experiment more. I'm open to any and all suggestions (any focal length or style of lens) at any and all price-points. I've been wanting to experience more with wide stuff, and thought about going the zoom route- 14-24 or 16-35-,  but those aren't really \"unique\"... Anyways, please let the flood gates open and throw any interesting suggestions at me! \n\nP.S. Speaking of the 58, how does the modern one compare to the old and highly coveted 58 1.2 NOCT?  AF aside, is the old NOCT 58 worlds better than the new one?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/i6e35y/are_you_still_loving_your_58_14g_also_suggest_me/"}, {"autor": "milquetoasterstrudel", "date": "2020-05-14 02:23:55", "content": "Great Horned Owl (D750 w/ Nikkor Q 135 2.8 Pre------> AI !!! ) /!/ I've been watching this owl occasionally fly around my neighborhood at dusk the past few months, but much to my pleasant surprise I caught sight of it during the late morning after it was being chased by crows into a fir tree.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/gjdf1i/great_horned_owl_d750_w_nikkor_q_135_28_preai/"}, {"autor": "Revan1995", "date": "2020-05-14 01:26:50", "content": "Nikon F4 | Nikkor -----> AI !!! -S 50mm F/1.8 | Kodak Portra 400", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/gjci9i/nikon_f4_nikkor_ais_50mm_f18_kodak_portra_400/"}, {"autor": "Revan1995", "date": "2020-06-11 19:30:22", "content": "Nikon F4 | Nikkor -----> AI !!! -S 50mm f/1.8 | Portra 400", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/h166oy/nikon_f4_nikkor_ais_50mm_f18_portra_400/"}, {"autor": "chaka160", "date": "2020-03-02 09:29:52", "content": "Shot this at Sutton Salt Lake (NZ) with my Nikon D800 and Nikon 24mm f2.8 -----> AI !!! -s lens", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/fc9n3b/shot_this_at_sutton_salt_lake_nz_with_my_nikon/"}, {"autor": "Samea1l", "date": "2020-03-01 00:57:46", "content": "Nikkor 105mm 1:4 -----> AI !!!

But of course, I can only buy one.  For what I've read in other forums: \n\n\u2206 the Pre AI version can be mounted to the 3xxx and 5xxx without damaging them BUT these cameras models won't be able to measure the exposure or f-stop. So you pretty much have to guess the exposure.\n\nBut I'm wondering if it's the same situation for the AI and the AIS revisions. So my questions are:\n1. Can they be mounted without damaging my camera?\n2. Is the AIS revision still not compatible with my D3300? (can it tell me the f-stop, exposure)\n\nSo yeah, in case that neither revision is compatible with my camera, I think I'm confident enough in my knowledge of the triangle of exposure to properly expose my photos.

Using the OVF, both spot and matrix meter underexposed this plastic fence. Switching to LiveView, both spot and matrix achieved the perfect flash exposure. So far this is only an issue with manual lenses as I\u2019ve had no issue with my 2 AF-S G lenses, but I\u2019ve had to resort to using GN and reading the focus distance off my lens barrel on the AI-S lens. OVF flash doesn\u2019t seem to be using anything but distance information and without it, it won\u2019t expose correctly. LV flash seems to work exactly as expected. Attached are 2MB jpg samples using LV and OVF with spot and matrix metering. Again this is with an SB-700 set to iTTL, D780 with a Nikkor AI 200mm F/4. I\u2019ve had 0 issues with my 50 f1.8G or 24-120 f4G lenses, but my AI won\u2019t meter flash correctly using the OVF even using FV lock and forcing a pre-flash. It seems like the D780 only meters flash with the OVF using the lens distance information instead of using pre-flash data. I\u2019ve had the same issue with that lens and photographing my 1 year old, so it\u2019s not just that fence causing it. There\u2019s no reason for different flash metering between OVF and LV. \n\nAll are 1/200, f/4, and ISO 400:\n\n[Spot in LV](https://i.imgur.com/9qA861V.jpg)\n[Spot in OVF](https://i.imgur.com/jAH4bv1.jpg)\n[Matrix in LV](https://i.imgur.com/EhtRjHA.jpg)\n[Matrix in OVF](https://i.imgur.com/3IPXS1M.jpg) \n \nI\u2019ve heard of other people having trouble with their Nikon flashes metering on the D780 and loss of compatibility with their Godox system, but until now I hadn\u2019t had an issue with my SB-700.
