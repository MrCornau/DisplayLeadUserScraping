In capture one express my lossless compressed .raf images work great. In Luminar -----> AI !!!  it's painfully slow. If I convert the .raf to .Dng Luminar AI works also fast.\n\nSo that leaves me with capture one express .raf or Luminar AI with .Dng\n\nIs there any downside in using .Dng (outside of the need to convert)? Because I really like Luminar AI.\n\nWhat do u guys use?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/kk5mi6/raf_or_dng_post_processing/"}, {"autor": "D0ubleZer0", "date": "2020-04-03 15:17:16", "content": "Rear Window situation, Italy [X-T1, Yashica 35mm -----> ML !!!  2.8]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/fua70o/rear_window_situation_italy_xt1_yashica_35mm_ml_28/"}, {"autor": "Hauneul", "date": "2020-09-26 03:52:39", "content": "Twin Moons, Double Exposure, X-T2, Nikon 50mm F1.8 -----> AI !!!
