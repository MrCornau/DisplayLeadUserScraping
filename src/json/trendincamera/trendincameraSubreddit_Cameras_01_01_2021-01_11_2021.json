I know nothing about camera specs. /!/ As the title says. Here's a link to gsmarena comparing both phones specs side by side.\n\n[https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=8966&amp;idPhone2=10396](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=8966&amp;idPhone2=10396)\n\nI don't know anything about camera specs, and im trying to decide which one to keep and which one to sell off. I have both of these and inherited the S9 due to wife getting a newer phone.\n\nI was surprised to notice that the S9 was taking better photos than the xperia, to my eyes at least.\n\nThe stock camera app on the xperia is total crap. The S9 only has one basic camera app, no photo pro mode like the xperia, which gives you all the features you would expect on a dedicated camera, as well as full control such as lens type, zooming, type of focusing, ISO and so on.\n\nDespite all that, and all the tweaks i make on the xperia to take a photo, the s9 just seems to do a better job at taking a single shot, and yes, on the s9 you do have a \"pro\" mode under the camera app to make changes as you can on the xperia, but nowhere near the same amount of features or functionality, and yet still, a single shot using the basic camera and letting the -----> AI !!!  do it's job, it gives a better result in my opinion.\n\nAm i blind? I mean, i have a prescription for glasses to see better, for sharper view of objects at longer distances, but looking at stuff close up my eyes are fine.\n\nSo what is making the S9 better than the xperia? the camera specs are there on the link, but i dont understand any of it.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/n1qnm2/galaxy_s9_smg960f_vs_xperia_5_ii_xqas52_which_is/"}, {"autor": "thenerdpulse", "date": "2021-01-29 18:20:49", "content": "Is Samsung's Galaxy S21 Ultra using -----> AI !!!  to fake detailed Moon photos?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/l7zufx/is_samsungs_galaxy_s21_ultra_using_ai_to_fake/"}, {"autor": "Tall-Swim7140", "date": "2021-10-28 21:25:42", "content": "Pivo Pod X /!/ Capture, share, play.
