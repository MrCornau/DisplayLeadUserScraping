It still flickers even in natural light a little but it's really bad under anything with an A/C cycle where video from my D7200 is rock solid under the same lighting shooting the same scene. Apparently this was an issue with this particular camera as I've come to discover after googling the issue.\n\nI'm shooting 1080/30p with manual settings and fixed WB and ISO and have to drop shutter speed to 1/30th of a second to smooth out the flicker enough to be somewhat useable - at my preferred 1/60th shutter speed, it looks like it was filmed with a hand cranked movie camera it flickers so bad. Also, noise performance in video mode isn't nearly as good as the D7200 but that was somewhat expected and I could live with it if it didn't flicker so bad (which also draws attention to the noise). \n\nI've tried flicker reduction on auto and 60hz and neither was any better or worse. There's no option to turn it off(?)\n\nI tested with both mechanical -----> AI !!!  lenses and modern AF-S lenses and saw no difference.\n\nI updated to the latest firmware and no improvement.\n\nAgain, stills look fantastic from it and ISO performance is excellent in stills mode and no issues with inconsistencies from shot to shot in stills mode.\n\nIf anyone has a magic fix for the video flicker issue, I'd love to hear it but otherwise, I need to move on to something else.\n\nSo, can anyone assure me that other Nikon bodies don't exhibit this flickering? I'm looking specifically at the D3300/3400 or D5200/5300 since they offer the specific features I need at bargain basement to modest budget prices.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/q5herk/d3200_video_flickering_replacement_suggestions/"}, {"autor": "lawstudent1994", "date": "2021-10-10 14:18:11", "content": "Freedom chicken.
