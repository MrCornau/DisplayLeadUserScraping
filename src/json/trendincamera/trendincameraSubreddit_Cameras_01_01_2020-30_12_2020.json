I am not a photographer so I\u2019d only be using the camera for birthdays and family events. I just wanna know what is the difference between an iPhone 11 camera or galaxy s20 plus ultra camera, or how much you have to spend on a camera to see the difference. Just by looking at the images from galaxy s20 ultra I don\u2019t think that a $600-800 camera would be an upgrade but I could be wrong. \n\nI was looking at canon sl3 plus a 18-135 3.5-5.6 lens to quench my thirst but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see a difference in quality. Let me know if I am wrong. \n\nThen I was looking at Sony a7r2 + 24-70 f2.8 lens, even if I pick it up used it will cost me $1500 and that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for birthday and family pictures but I am willing to get it I am also willing to get a7iii for $2000 but nothing higher. \n\nLet\u2019s say I get this sony a7r2 or a7iii with the lens (plus decent prime later) will I see a difference that\u2019s worth $1,500-2,000? If I do then how long will this difference last? \n\nFrom my litter research I found out that iPhone X/XS/11/11pro and galaxy s10/note 10 were using a 25mm sensor and galaxy s20 ultra has a ~48mm sensor that\u2019s almost double in size. If the pictures I\u2019ve been taking were already half decent especially in day light or good lighting then won\u2019t I be more than satisfied with a sensor that\u2019s letting in double the light and also with this fake -----> AI !!!  low light stuff. \n\n\nShould I buy one? Should I get a cheap camera like the canon sl3 or Nikon 5600 kit?

I really like to climb weird places, do street photography etc. \n\nThe other thing I feel the A300 is really a lackluster in is in poor light conditions. with its \"boosted\" ISO of 3400, which makes the pictures very grained BTW, and somewhat poor handling on multiple light sources and intensities, I really would like a camera with competent night time capabilities. \n\nThird: I live near a civilian and military airport. And I really like taking nice pictures of those magnificent birds (sweet falcons) when they are going in and out of the airport. A fast and reliable autofocus would be very desirable for me. My girlfriend also wants this as it means better pictures of her doing her gymnastic shenanigans.\n\nI am not a big fan of mirrorless cameras as they feel very flimsy and awkward to hold and handle for me. I have been looking at the Nikon D5600 a little as that thing is in the price range I have and still being able to get some good glass for it. But I haven't committet to anything but the price range.

I have an EOS M100 (15-45mm lens) and am very happy with the camera. I have used it for quite a bit, but mostly on automatic mode.

Say something like this(but perhaps better ) i found on google:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/3b/f7/643bf7a25d579ba70e6b3dc96a7e1206.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/3b/f7/643bf7a25d579ba70e6b3dc96a7e1206.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(ignore the messaging on it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to be able to read the text on the cart and detailed picture of the grafitti. I could buy an additional lense for the EOS M100 as listed here ([https://travelfornoobs.com/best-lenses-for-canon-eos-m100/](https://travelfornoobs.com/best-lenses-for-canon-eos-m100/))  - in the 200mm range (will this be sufficient for my desired resolution?). However, the EOS M100 is not the best in my opinion in terms of software for my project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor my project I am looking to document and classify train graffiti. Perhaps I will identify various styles or artists...or whatever discovery I make -  I am not sure yet. Perhaps I will just make a big poster with composed of many train shots and gift it to a friend. I feel like I am exploring an ancient language in a Egyptian pyramid and do not know where the exploration will take me but I am very excited of all the possibilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have lots of trains rolling in on this bridge and I am considering setting up two cameras. The first camera would be a very primitive camera with the purpose of identifying moving trains (this would be done with some sort of -----> machine learning !!!  type approach - I have never done something like this, but have enough experience in programming to tackle such a project and know that it is possible. For this camera I will use something cheap - my 8megapixel phone camera seems to be okay for this for picking up movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first camera will identify when the trains are rolling in (there are like 20 minutes breaks in between) and based on the computed speed of train the second camera will take picture of each train cart while it is on the clear shot area of the bridge. The images will then be transferred to a computer for post processing of some sort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy EOS m100 is not the best candidate for the second camera (assuming I had an appropriate lens). It is difficult to automate picture taking. I have done a rough test - eos m100 has a cell phone app provided by canon that is capable of taking pictures remotely through the cell phone on screen press. This can be hooked up to a laptop that just automates the pressing of a cellphone screen in order to take pictures ([https://www.rightpoint.com/rplabs/automating-input-events-abd-keyevent](https://www.rightpoint.com/rplabs/automating-input-events-abd-keyevent)) - the laptop can hypothetically use camera one's machine learning data to automate the press when required. However, after basic trials I am not sure I can really specify the image taking rate based  on different train speed (they don't go too fast so it is not the biggest concern but getting consistent shots of train carts on the exact same part of the bridge would be nice). The EOS sometimes needs to refocus between pictures and I don't think I can get too precise with the picture taking rate. For constant power I could buy something like this ([https://www.amazon.com/Glorich-ACK-E12-Replacement-Adapter-Mirrorless/dp/B00VNSD7LW](https://www.amazon.com/Glorich-ACK-E12-Replacement-Adapter-Mirrorless/dp/B00VNSD7LW)). In addition, it is difficult to extract images from the EOS m100 live without taking out the sd card and exiting the canon remote picture taking app which would require physical interference and not be able to allow my camera two to take pictures for many days at a time (I would like to take pictures for a few weeks minimum).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question to you guys:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat general lens do you recommend for getting the resolution that I desire?\n\nWhat camera core body (without the lens) do you recommend that could provide more effective interface with my computer for automated picture taking and image downloads while still being powered on for days on end?\n\nPerhaps I could combine the two questions together for a camera/lens combo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy budget is in Canadian.
