I used to use Nikon and Canon full frame in the past, and I really enjoyed using manual lenses, among my favorite ones are: most nikon -----> ai !!! /-----> ai !!! s lenses, many m42 mount lenses especially aus jena 50mm. etc.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Back when I used Nikon, there were some problems, such as no infinity focus, etc. Does sony a6300 have any limitation or problem like this, or basically I can use any kind of manual lenses if I got the adapters?\n2. I have a weak eye, so it was difficult for me to really rely on my eyes only to find the focus. I used to use adapters with electronic chip so that I got the focus confirmation beep/sound that is very helpful. Does this work similarly on a6300? I checked many youtube videos, mostly suggested to zoom in the live view and fine tune the focus from there. Is there any kind of 'assistance' (like focus confirmation sound or indicator) that you can tell when your object is in focus or not?\n3. Any good (and cheap) recommendations on which adapters I should look into? I am thinking to get nikon Ai/Ais and M42 adapters. I did a bit of research, it seems the $10 adapters work just fine?\n4. Other than that, I might think to get another auto focus portrait lens (for a backup, sometimes my wife wants to use the camera but is not familiar with manual lenses), any suggestion for good and cheap lens to buy? Something that is sharp enough and have a good bokeh for sure.\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/nhqgvu/questions_about_manual_lenses_on_a6300/"}, {"autor": "toilets_for_sale", "date": "2021-10-20 20:10:34", "content": "The Hunter's Moon | a7rIII | Nikon 500mm f/4 P -----> AI !!! -s", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/qc9rbb/the_hunters_moon_a7riii_nikon_500mm_f4_p_ais/"}, {"autor": "toilets_for_sale", "date": "2021-09-15 17:20:35", "content": "The Moon, 20% illuminated at sunset. | a7rIII | Nikkor 500mm f/4 P -----> AI !!! -s", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/poulhr/the_moon_20_illuminated_at_sunset_a7riii_nikkor/"}], "name": "Subreddit_SonyAlpha_01_01_2021-01_11_2021"}
