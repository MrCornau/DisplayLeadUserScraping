I have the opportunity to get my hands on a used APO Summicron-R 90mm ASPH. I don't own an R series camera and I'm currently shooting with a Nikon Fm3a. I understand that the mount conversion is reversible and doesn't permanently alter the lens.\n\nIf I were to acquire the lens and the conversion kit, would the lens behave like a standard -----> AI !!! -S lens?
