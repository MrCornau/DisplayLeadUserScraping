I can't think of a system that gives me this type of capability with this type of portability, am I right?\n\n- In terms of non Sony, there's the Canon RP with the RF 35mm 1.8, but the RF lens is a bit fatter, the RP is a bit wider, and then any other FF -----> ML !!!  body outside of Sony or the RP gets fairly bigger. Also the A7iii is noticeably better DR and low-light than the RP.\n- If I go APS-C, there's the X-T4 with 23mm 1.4, but that's almost same overall size/weight, and the Sony is going to have better low light and the 1.8 is a bit shallower DOF wise when equivalency is taken into account. M43 I'd need a 17mm f/0.9 which I don't believe exists in AF form.\n- There's fixed lens like RX1Rii or Leica Q. I've used both, they are both pricier than the A7iii+35mm combo and I at least want the option to use another lens or two if need be. I think even having the kit 28-70 available ot me opens up a lot more possibilities than being just limited to 28 or 35.\n\nI mean, have I thought this through correctly? Am I missing anything?
