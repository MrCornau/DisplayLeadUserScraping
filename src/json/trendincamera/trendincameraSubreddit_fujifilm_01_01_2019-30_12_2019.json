The thing is... I do want to spend my money well and I tend not to upgrade my stuff because photography is indeed expensive for me.  \n\nMy points:  \n- I own a few great old glass to adapt (Zeiss Planar 50mm 1.4 and Yashica -----> ML !!!  35MM 2.8 + various Minolta)   \n- My old glass made me consider the Sony A7, but then I discovered Fuji and MAYBE the possibility of using a speed booster/focal reducer (Kipon makes C/Y to FX. I prefer a 50mm over a 75) + more compact is great and the pop up flash is underrated IMO (the A7 does not have it).\n\n- If I get Fuji I'll probably also get the compact 15-45 kit. I like compact, though adapted lens are not.  \n- I shoot RAW, I would test the famous Fuji jpegs though. \n\nMy concerns:  \n- An enjoyable viewfinder and focus peaking are important to me, my current digital lacks both. How do they compare?\n\n- The  fully ariticulated screen on the X-T100 is DEFINITELY a PRO because I am into self portraits, but on the other hand the (ouch!) more expensive X-T20 seems to have more dials. Does it offer a more enjoyable shooting experience?  \n- Also how fast is changing the iso on both cameras? Do both offer separate dials for the speed, aperture and ISO?\n- Bonus question: Should I go Sony A7 anyway?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/b44nnv/need_feedback_about_usability_of_xt20_vs_xt100/"}, {"autor": "Nyc81", "date": "2019-05-26 13:49:15", "content": "Sunday Fuji GAS Discussion /!/ So I'm at a point where I have sold off some gear and lenses I wasn't using and freed up some funds for new gear that will \"absolutely make me a better photographer\" \ud83d\ude01\n\nCurrently enjoying an xe2 with the 23mm f2 and adapted Nikon 50mm 1.4 -----> AI !!! .  This is a very fun set up, especially with the manual lens.   \n\nSo the options:\n\n1. Fuji 50mm f2 to help when I don't have the time to manually focus.\n \n2.  Other 50ish mm AF lenses?  Any good options?\n\nAnd\n\n1.  Used Xpro2 - BS aside, its really down to the form factor.  OVF would be minimally used.   Could be more stealth for street use.\n\n2.  Used Xt2 - late entry.  Xpro2 guys with easier control access.  Cheaper and more plentiful than xpro2.  Bigger EVF for manual focusing since I really like the split screen focus option.\n\nAt some point looking to throw in a gr2 or gr3 as well bc I'm just miss the GR1 I sold.\n\nThat is all.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/bt843j/sunday_fuji_gas_discussion/"}], "name": "Subreddit_fujifilm_01_01_2019-30_12_2019"}
