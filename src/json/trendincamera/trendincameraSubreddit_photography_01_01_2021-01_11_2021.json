I\u2019m sure a good number of you have at least some experience shooting film as well!\n\nRemember how there was kind of an unspoken rule\u2026maybe an understanding, if you will, that you should usually choose the slowest film speed you could for a given shoot? Of course, if you were not using flash you would try to choose a film speed that would match the expected natural light conditions.\n\nThe caveat was always that you did not want any faster film than necessary as faster film speeds would introduce more film grain! Back then, apparently we thought grain was bad!\n\nDecades later we have amazing digital sensors to capture extraordinarily clean images\u2026even at somewhat high ISO (the digital similarity to film speed). But even as good as they are we still get digital noise (the digital similarity to grain) at times. So to further clean all noise from our images, we engage in a multitude of noise reduction techniques\u2026and even spend additional money to purchase the latest generation of -----> AI !!!  noise reduction tools!\n\nAt the end of all of this digital technology and artist\u2019s efforts, we have some amazing, clean and crisp images! They are stunning!\n\nBut we don\u2019t stop there\u2026at least not any,ore! Now we are being told we can create a more generic look by\u2026you guessed it\u2026adding digitally created grain into the image!\n\nThis is where I\u2019m lost! Why did I spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours purchasing and practicing my digital photography equipment and skills\u2026including post processing?\n\nThis seems to be the same lunacy that drives us to buy an 80\u201d TV and then watch Netflix on a smartphone! Or, replace our entire audio system and music collection with CDs\u2026only to now say we prefer the sound of vinyl!\n\n\nAre we just a restless lot who can never find anything satisfactory? I write some of this a bit satirically, however I am seriously looking for someone who can shed a light on why people, photographers in our case, are never satisfied?\n\nChange for something better os progress\u2026but change JUST for something different seems insane!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/pffnoq/have_we_gone_a_bit_insane/"}, {"autor": "Drama79", "date": "2021-08-31 17:32:55", "content": "Interested in people\u2019s experiences with Luminar -----> AI !!!  as their photo editor of choice? /!/ Particularly with regards to long term cataloguing, but also just as an editor day to day?

Now the ERR01 would hit on the first attempt every time. \n\nOut of curiosity I wondered if the DOF preview button would still work. I figured there was only so much communication occuring between the camera and lens. AF was working fine so aperture control seemed to be the offender.

And I would go one step beyond and even claim that it is soon going to die.\n\nLet me explain my point of view and why I believe so. I will start with some trivial reasons and then move on the main reason in the latter half of this discussion post. \n\nFirst of all I am really worried with the advancement in camera technology happening these days and it getting cheaper and more accessible every day. There are so many hobbyist (like me) that are coming up due to this and they like to take their pictures themselves. They don't need a lot of fancy gear and can get what they want even from their smartphones and software techniques without much pain. There are already cameras in smartphones that can open up to f/1.4 (Vivo X60 pro) giving tremendous low light performance for example. So be it, but the most worrisome part is that they are ready to sell their pictures (again like me) for peanuts. I for example sell my photos for less than a dollar per picture. May be this doesn't pose a lot of threat to professionals but keep up with me.\n\nNext issue that I would like to point out is that of websites like unsplash and pexels. People including some top notch photographers post their pictures here for free. Individuals and more importantly major companies/industries now have an access to large amount of stock photos for free! I myself was shocked to see my photos reaching far and wide to websites like Buzzfeed, WordPress, Flickr etc and I gained nothing in return apart from come graphs and stats showing my reach, views and downloads.\n\nAll these things are eating up the photography market from inside out like a parasite I believe. But as if this was not enough, let me introduce you to GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). So far you might be wondering that there is still scope for specialization in fields like weddings, fashion, product, food, landscape, wildlife, portraits etc. If so, then I request you to kindly read further into this discussion.\n\nGANs are a -----> deep learning !!!  based set of algorithm that can literally do magic. They will change the dynamics completely. **Photos will soon be created** (not taken). Once trained against a large set of database (which is available for free as mentioned before), they can make new photos. restore old photos, include what you want in a scene (like yourself), replace something that you want in a scene and what not!\n\nSome applications already available are:\n\n* Generation of random realistic portraits/models completely wiping out fashion photography.\n* Generation of cartoon characters, wiping out graphics/vector designers.\n* Image to image translation. (restoring old photos as high definition new photos, black and white to color images, sketches to realistic images)\n* Text to image translation. wiping out landscape/wildlife photography. (literally converting text like, \"A small Indian ringneck sitting on a branch\" into multiple image choices.)\n* Face repositioning and regeneration. (generate/reorient a face into required position)\n\nGANs are no joke. The results are already staggering. You must have seen deepfake challenges inviting you to find the difference between fake and original images.\n\n I would like to know your thoughts on it. Are you concerned? or things are not as grim as I portray.
