So I tried practicing and creating a few looks inspired by films. I'm giving these LUTs away for free. They were originally meant for Sony Alpha cameras, specifically A7III. Pack contains 2 options. Cine4 version and non-flat profile version (you apply the LUT after REC 709 conversion). They are available on my web (link below). I would love to get any feedback, so I can improve next time! :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://vojtechokenka.com/lutpack](https://vojtechokenka.com/lutpack)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks and have a nice day!", "title": "Free LUTs", "num-comments": 0, "score": 1, "date": "2019-07-14 03:55:06", "content": "Free LUTs /!/ Hello everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a fan of a color grading.

I am planning to do capture 3 different kinds of photography; Landscape/Rock Climbing,  Astro,  and LandscapeAstro photography. My astrophotography subject is both  the Orion and Flame Nebula in the same frame. My LandscapeAstro target is a nice star trail image with a Joshua Tree decently lit in the foreground. My Landscape/Rock Climbing subjects are going to be of our group out bouldering and and just the natural beauty of Joshua Tree National Park.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Dilemma:\n\nIs there a way I can set up folders on the A7iii so when I start taking photos of a new project it automatically loads the photos into a new folder?  If I cant do it automatically can I create new folders manually?  My back up solution is to dump each memory card onto an external hard drive before each subject is photographed. i have a few spare memory cards so i wont have any down time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope I have explained my dilemma well enough that someone has a workable solution.
