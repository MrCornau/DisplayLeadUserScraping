The code is manipulated to suit this clock . I believe the RIBBA clock originated from the Whitestone Clock Company Instructable so another shout out for coming up with the design originally.\nThe original RIBBA clock uses 144 LEDS this clock uses 22 LEDS\nThe time is displayed in 5 minute intervals and the letters 'about' become a darker blue as it approaches the 5. For example: say its approaching 3pm, at 5 to the letters 'about' will light up white and gradually turn a darker blue every minute up until 3pm, but it could be any five minute interval, it will become apparent.\nWe are using cast Acrylic and I am using Vetric Cut2D for the design of this clock, the base can be made of anything, for the purpose of this Instructable its 12mm MDF as its what I had to hand and its in 3 sections but doesn't need to be.\nYou will need to have a CNC machine for cutting the slots in both the Acrylic and MDF plus engraving the clock letters.\nPersonal Protective equipment, Dust mask, Safety Glasses and Ear protection.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/LED-Aduino-Horizontal-Edge-Lit-Clock-WemosD1/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "protective equipment", "selectorShort": "equipment", "MarkedSent": "led aduino horizontal edge lit clock wemosd1__i picked up the idea for this horizontal edge lit led clock from an instructable some time ago called ribba word clock, the clock uses a arduino wemos d1 and gets its time from a server, the creator of the clock is neotrace and a big thanks to him for supplying the code. the code is manipulated to suit this clock . i believe the ribba clock originated from the whitestone clock company instructable so another shout out for coming up with the design originally.\nthe original ribba clock uses 144 leds this clock uses 22 leds\nthe time is displayed in 5 minute intervals and the letters 'about' become a darker blue as it approaches the 5. for example: say its approaching 3pm, at 5 to the letters 'about' will light up white and gradually turn a darker blue every minute up until 3pm, but it could be any five minute interval, it will become apparent.\nwe are using cast acrylic and i am using vetric cut2d for the design of this clock, the base can be made of anything, for the purpose of this instructable its 12mm mdf as its what i had to hand and its in 3 sections but doesn't need to be.\nyou will need to have a cnc machine for cutting the slots in both the acrylic and mdf plus engraving the clock letters.\npersonal -----> protective !!!  -----> equipment !!! , dust mask, safety glasses and ear protection.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "2.0K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7903804, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8132, "autor": "PlainsPirate", "date": null, "content": "Skateboard Deck From Scrap Wood (without Templet)__I have been riding cruisers and long boards for a few years now.
