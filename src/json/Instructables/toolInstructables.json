They can also be used for a variety of other types of measurement, in particular with specialize accessories, like a height gauge adapter. We'll look at the construction and adjustment of several types of rod-type inside mic.\nThere are a lot of variations on what is, in essence, a stick. The photo shows a fairly common style: the interchangeable solid rod type. It has the key features of most inside micrometers, those being a micrometer screw inside to allow the length between the precisely positioned measuring faces. The faces are spherical segments and should contact the inside surface being measured on an exact diameter to get an accurate measure. There are other styles, but this is the most common general purpose style, as it can cover a wide range (one set I use regularly covers 38mm to 2500mm) at reasonable cost.\nOnce properly calibrated, as long as there is no damage, there isn't significant wear, and the adjustment isn't messed with, the measurement can be directly read from the micrometer. There are sources that claim that you can not trust the reading, but if the tool is properly set and calibrated, the reading will be correct to the precision and uncertainty of the calibration. Wear can be an issue, as, by design, there is very small contact area when making a measurement.\nFirst, definitions:\nCalibration of the tool is where it is compared against a standard, error quantified, and uncertainty determined. There is often a permissible limit for the error, and if this limit is not met, the tool must be adjusted.\nAdjustment is when a property of the tool is changed to reduce error\nThe uncertainty is primarily a result of the process used for calibration and the uncertainties of the references used to do the calibration, as well as the inherent uncertainty of the tool being calibrated.\nThe best way to calibrate an inside mic is with a calibration ring (Gauge ring). These often cost more than the micrometer, and for a wide range set, you need to have a lot of them. Most small shops don't keep a range on hand, but either use alternative methods or send the tools out to a calibration specialist. For many, many applications, alternative methods are sufficient.

(CylinDraw operates at 0.2mm wide stroke, lasers are 0.1-0.5mm.) Engraving is also a safer cleaner process than laser etching since fumes and fire are not a factor. Lasers must be vented to the outside because of chemical byproducts (smoke), while mechanical engravers only create physical byproducts (microparticles) which can be contained with a shop vac.\nBut of equal importance to what it does, is how it does it.\nCool hardware is still a useless brick without software, and if the software sucks then its an irritating brick. But get both things right and using the tool becomes such an effective process that you can start taking it for granted. That's when you know it has improved your life and that was the intent. Every aspect of this tool is designed to make the user experience painless, because I think computers should just work so you can focus on the art!\nCylinDraw software is all-inclusive. It can convert any bitmap image like a photo or screenshot into a vector graphic (SVG) and then into a drawing-in-progress in minutes. Most drawings are doable in under an hour.\nThe system automatically makes assumptions on your behalf to streamline the process. A few examples:\nMulticolor jobs self sort the colors by brightness so you don't smear light colors with dark ones.\nOptimized drawing paths using a honed greedy algorithm.\nAutomatically updating the feed & speed (steps-per-mm) to account for varying cup diameter.\nAutomatic connection to the tool when the USB cable is plugged in. A happy beep tells you all is well.\nSeparate user interfaces for separate functions so that all the information on screen is relevant, and the only controls you have are the ones you need.\nNo internet-of-things planned obsolescence security nightmare nonsense. CylinDraw operates entirely without internet access.\nCustom 'JOB' files (machine readable g-code files) use an .svg extension so they can be viewed as thumbnails or in a browser.\nAnother interesting thing to note is that it does not use grbl. The software and firmware was written from scratch to best meet the unique requirements of this device. (grbl takes up a lot of space on Arduino & it is more complex than I need for some things, which was a hinderance for adding features I needed.

(cylindraw operates at 0.2mm wide stroke, lasers are 0.1-0.5mm.) engraving is also a safer cleaner process than laser etching since fumes and fire are not a factor. lasers must be vented to the outside because of chemical byproducts (smoke), while mechanical engravers only create physical byproducts (microparticles) which can be contained with a shop vac.\nbut of equal importance to what it does, is how it does it.\ncool hardware is still a useless brick without software, and if the software sucks then its an irritating brick. but get both things right and using the tool becomes such an effective process that you can start taking it for granted. that's when you know it has improved your life and that was the intent. every aspect of this tool is designed to make the user experience painless, because i think computers should just work so you can focus on the art!\ncylindraw software is all-inclusive. it can convert any bitmap image like a photo or screenshot into a vector graphic (svg) and then into a drawing-in-progress in minutes. most drawings are doable in under an hour.\nthe system automatically makes assumptions on your behalf to streamline the process. a few examples:\nmulticolor jobs self sort the colors by brightness so you don't smear light colors with dark ones.\noptimized drawing paths using a honed greedy algorithm.\nautomatically updating the feed & speed (steps-per-mm) to account for varying cup diameter.\nautomatic connection to the tool when the usb cable is plugged in. a happy beep tells you all is well.\nseparate user interfaces for separate functions so that all the information on screen is relevant, and the only controls you have are the ones you need.\nno internet-of-things planned obsolescence security nightmare nonsense. cylindraw operates entirely without internet access.\ncustom 'job' files (machine readable g-code files) use an .svg extension so they can be viewed as thumbnails or in a browser.\nanother interesting thing to note is that it does not use grbl. the software and firmware was written from scratch to best meet the unique requirements of this device. (grbl takes up a lot of space on arduino & it is more complex than i need for some things, which was a hinderance for adding features i needed. so starting from scratch was the easier choice.)", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "8.9K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7903644, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3686, "autor": "MechaNickW", "date": null, "content": "Refurbish an Old Shopsmith Mark V__I first saw a Shopsmith in a friend's father's garage years and years ago.

So, I think it is my time to contribute with something that, to my best knowledge and strangely, is not available to buy and can save some frustration. Some people also asked me dimensions and related information, so I can direct them to this page.\nSome months ago I bought a set of letter punches just because I wanted to add my \"signature\" to the stuff I make. Isn't something funny (and kind of heartwarming) when you buy old tools/stuff at a flea markets and then you find the authors signature under the rust? Well, I'm always looking for that details and I'm very pleased by that.\nProblem\nEverything is fine until I try to write my name in a stainless steel plate. Without any guide or similar help I could not write a straight word and with the correct and reproducible spacing between the letters. Adding a straight edge helped with the straightness of the word, but the spacing between letters was irregular and not good and did not see any improvement with practicing.

Easiest to Build Wing Sail.__Here's an incredible Instructable for building a wing sail, called the Wing'soul. It's the world's easiest to build wing sail because simplicity overrules complexity. Common components (found at most hardware stores) are chosen over custom boat parts. Flat cut canvas is preferred over curved cut. Easy to sail and safety wins over specialized sail wardrobe.\nFirst, there is no rotating mast requirement. The Wing'soul is best paired to a static freestanding mast. An example is the Laser dinghy, with its plain mast. For a larger boat, a junk rig or the Freedom rig is ideal for conversion. If you want to convert a standard Bermudian rig, you'd have to change the mast. The mast must be round (not have a flat side) and without mid-mast spreaders. Due to the change in the center of effort, probably the new mast will need to move forward (about 3% of the LOA), closer to the bow.\nGuess why wing sails were invented decades ago, but never got popular? Because almost all of them were designed with a rotating mast. Nothing kills adoption faster than this costly complication.\nAnother simplification: no hardware hinge. You'll notice a lot of other wing sails require a pivot or a hinge at the boom to switch the camber around. However, when the Wing'soul tacks, the wing sail (mainsail and jib/jiblets) changes camber automatically. It works exactly like a windsurfing rig.\nIn fact, the Wing'soul is heavily based on the Aerojunk, a rig invented by Paul McKay back in 2012. The Aerojunk is a junk version of the windsurfing rig; the Wing'soul is a winged version of the Aerojunk.\nThe sail is cut flat. No broadseaming or darting or rounding to create draught, unlike the cut in a Bermudian mainsail. Assemble the mainsail by seaming together long strips of rectangular sail cloths. The teardrop shape of the small winglet battens gives curvature at the luff. Aft of the luff to the leech, there is enough sail slack to produce camber.\nThe jib is also cut flat. The jib can be one long flat sail, or broken up to several pieces called jiblets. Jiblets are trapeziodal. The battens arrange the jiblets so there is slack, both horizontally and vertically. This creates camber in both axises.\nThis Instructable is for a small trial sail, perfect for a sailing dinghy like the Laser. It is also a learning tool, prototype, about how to build a bigger one. Fortunately, this rig scales up easily. A larger version will be bigger and sturdier, but has no additional components. I dream of making a Wing'soul rig for my 50-footer three masted schooner.\nA lot of the Wing'soul's characteristics can be based off the Aerojunk and the original junk rig. You should find: the Wing'soul reefs easily, handles very well downwind and beam-reach. On a broad-reach, it is possible to ease sheet past square, and \"sail in the lee\" for best performance. Like a junk, it's superb in heavy seas, mostly because of how well it reduces sail area, hardly ever flogs, and docile because of its semi-balanced design (the jib's CE partially offsets the main's CE).\nWhat about close-hauled? This point of sail needs further testing. However, the main and jib has plenty of camber for upwind beating. Camber can be anywhere from 6% to 12%. Really, it depends on internal lengths of the battens versus the length of the sail's chord. The slot effect, a key to a Bermudian's strength, is also part of this rig. Even better, the main's luff is a wing, further improving the aerodynamics at the main/jib junction, while reducing mast turbulence. Finally, induced drag (drag from vortex creation) is reduced because the planform may be tapered and rectangular. This is an improvement over triangular Bermudian mainsails. The Bermudian does have an advantage over the Wing'soul: higher aspect ratio for equal sail area. How all theses factors play out in the real world requires more testing.\nFinally, this rig will be fairly cheap to build, as nearly all the materials can be sourced from non-marine industries. For example, the mast can be a re-purposed aluminum utility pole, the sail material is outdoor utility canvas, the battens from aluminum tubes. This prototype cost $300 USD in parts. $100 was for the light rip-stop fabric. $100 was for the aluminum tubes, to make the wishbone battens.

this point of sail needs further testing. however, the main and jib has plenty of camber for upwind beating. camber can be anywhere from 6% to 12%. really, it depends on internal lengths of the battens versus the length of the sail's chord. the slot effect, a key to a bermudian's strength, is also part of this rig. even better, the main's luff is a wing, further improving the aerodynamics at the main/jib junction, while reducing mast turbulence. finally, induced drag (drag from vortex creation) is reduced because the planform may be tapered and rectangular. this is an improvement over triangular bermudian mainsails. the bermudian does have an advantage over the wing'soul: higher aspect ratio for equal sail area. how all theses factors play out in the real world requires more testing.\nfinally, this rig will be fairly cheap to build, as nearly all the materials can be sourced from non-marine industries. for example, the mast can be a re-purposed aluminum utility pole, the sail material is outdoor utility canvas, the battens from aluminum tubes. this prototype cost $300 usd in parts. $100 was for the light rip-stop fabric. $100 was for the aluminum tubes, to make the wishbone battens. the rest was $100 for miscellaneous parts.\nplease comment if you built this rig and tell me how it performed for you!", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "1.8K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7905990, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6057, "autor": "Pi_ster", "date": null, "content": "Home Buddy: Network Ad Blocker & Weather Station__Hi Folks!\nAren't you fed up with web tracking and \"personalized\" ads ?

I had tried the conventional hot wire cutting method to make a wing before, and the result was less than satisfactory (largely due to my lack of practice). Sanding a wing into its shape took too much time and made too much of a mess. My sights were straight on creating a wing-making method out of foam board that followed a standard airfoil shape, was easy and relatively quick, and had very good strength to weight ratio. With my 3D printing abilities at my tool belt, I got busy.\nThis particular build is tailored for creating a replacement wing for a HobbyZone Super Cub S, a 3 channel RC trainer that has long since been discontinued. If by some chance this Instructable helps you make a replacement wing for your old HobbyZone Super Cub, that is excellent!

I will hereafter call that one \"the old milling machine\". Over the years it has served me well, but the time has come to make a newer and better one. I now invite you to meet the \"new milling machine\".\nThe main culprit for the problems of the old milling machine was the cross vice. Although it worked, it had several limitations:\n- Poor construction: The obvious design choice here would be to use 4 thrust bearings, two at each point of contact of the movement screws with the body of the cross vice. To reduce cost, these were skipped. I had modified this early on, so it was no longer a problem.\n- Limited length of travel: The length of travel of the old machine was 14.5X12 cm and not all of this was always usable. When I had to mill a longer feature, as was often the case, I had to do this stepwise: Mill part of the feature, reposition the workpiece in the clamp, mill some more and repeat until the feature was complete. Although it worked, this approach was less than optimal.\n- Movement only in parallel and perpendicular directions (to the edge of the workpiece): This is due to the fact that the vice was integrated with the X-Y table without the possibility of rotation. I could work around this limitation with the use of jigs (e.g. see the angle milling jig in step five of this instructable) but again this was not optimal.\n- Not perfectly rigid: This had to do with the short length of the trapezoidal slider. Even with the adjustment screws fine-tuned, the cross vice displayed noticeable horizontal racking.\nA few months ago, I decided it was time to upgrade. I looked around for a suitable replacement for the cross vice and found the following candidate in e-bay: 450 x 170 mm Table Milling Machine Table de Travail de Fraisage pour Per\u00e7age. Please note that this link may become outdated soon, but as long as this item is in production, I would expect you to be able to find it using some of these words as search terms in e-bay. At the time these lines are written, there are several sellers on e-bay who offer the exact same milling table at similar prices. The seller from whom I bought mine is not bad - the tool arrived without problems, except from the mediocre packaging (which is not the seller's responsibility). On the other hand, he is not the best e-bay seller I 've ever seen: He doesn't leave feedback (even though I left positive feedback for him), he doesn't reply to questions (in the days of automatic translation, the fact that he probably can't read and write English is hardly an excuse). More important than the seller, however, is the product itself. At around 30 Kg, it is as sturdy as one could wish. After adjusting the gib screws, it slides smoothly, with virtually no racking. The handwheels were placed separately in the box and one of them would not fit its axle. Shaving a few mils on the lathe solved the problem. Overall, I find it is great value for money. I hoped it would be well built and it exceeded my expectations. Again, it is not perfect, but at this price one couldn't expect it to be.

Once I assembled the printer and its enclosure I needed a place for it to live - other than on top of my workbench - and wanted places to keep the assessories, supplies and tools that I would need for this new machine.\nBackground\nFor those of you who are not familiar with Snapmaker 2.0, this is Snapmaker's 2nd generation 3-in-1 product. The machine provides three functions:\nA normal 3D printer.\nA CNC machine for milling wood and some other materials (but not metal).\nA laser cutter capable of cutting some thin wood and engraving some other materials like plastic.\nThere are three models of the Snapmaker 2.0 ranging in build volume from the smallest to the largest - the A150, A250 and A350. If you want more information you can go to the Snapmaker website - www.snapmaker.com.\nThe A350 has three interchangeable tool heads for the three functions, and three different work surfaces that are used for these three functions. The enclosure has accordion type doors on two sides allowing access to the machine and built in LED lighting and a fan to exhaust any fumes from 3D printing or laser cutting.\nAfter figuring out how big the enclosure was I decided that a roll around cart would fit the bill. Given the constraints I had in the shop, the total height of the cart and printer could not exceed 54\". Honestly, I would have liked to make the cart taller so that while working on the machine I didn't have to bend over so much. But, as I said, I had some constraints. So I started sketching and came up with the cart you see here.\nCart Features\nThe main features of the cart are:\nTwo large drawers - one for keeping 3D printing filament and other large items, the other for smaller items and projects in process\nTwo flip-down drawer fronts that hide:\nPull-out boards for each of the three different work surfaces\nA pull-out board for storing the three tool heads\nA space for the printer's power module\nA pull-out board for a parts/tool box that holds the hardware for the work surfaces and any required tools\nLockable, polyurethane swivel casters - using these at all four corners give the cart maximum flexibility for moving it around the shop in tight quarters\nSpace at the back of the enclosure for a place to feed the power unit to the printer through a 2\" grommet as well as a power strip since I know I'll need to plug in some other things\nThis is really just a woodworking project that is specific to the needs of the Snapmaker A350.

During finals week there were absolutely no desks or tables available in the library. I thought, what if I could walk into the library with a briefcase looking thing and plop a desk down anywhere. I could even set up in a quiet elevator \u00e0 la Remi Gaillard. Although I currently don\u2019t have this problem in my life, I think having this will be beneficial with working from home, for visiting family members, limited living space, and as a general tool for my making, photography, and filmmaking hobbies. I think there are some people that could benefit from using the design without the legs and instead, placing it on an existing table.

After all, there are more things one can do than sliding bevels, right?\nThere are a few valid answers to that question.\nFirst of all, the sliding bevel shown in my first instructable, although it is a beauty (if I may say so myself), takes a heck of a lot of time to make.\nSecond and most important, in order to make it I used a heck of a lot of tools. Now there is nothing wrong with using tools if you have them, but the point of instructables is to show others how to make something. An instructable that begins with \"go get yourself a metal lathe and a milling machine\" especially when addressed to a woodworker (amateur or otherwise), which I believe is the main target group of this, is not very useful. So here is my simpler version, which requires nothing more exotic than a bench bandsaw (sorry, the bandsaw is pretty much necessary, unless you are a handsaw wiz).\nThird, there is a \"modify it\" speed challenge on and I thought I would show you how I modify a shop-bought, bottom of the line sliding bevel with a plastic body and mediocre hardware into a beautiful tool that will be a joy to behold and even more to use.\nAnd fourth, I had an order for this exact tool, so I thought I would just document it as I build it.\nIf you have already read my earlier instructable, I hope you will forgive me for being somewhat repetitive here.\nMeasure twice, cut once goes an old woodworking adage. The idea is that it is easy to make measuring mistakes, but much more difficult to fix them once you have used the (bad) measurement for cutting a piece.\nSo, measuring once is bad. \u039ceasuring twice is better. One would be justified in assuming that the next best thing is measuring thrice, but in fact it isn't. What is better, amazingly, is not measuring at all. Or at least, not using numbers for measuring, opting instead to transfer the measurement directly from one piece to another. This is the idea behind \"story sticks\", and it works well. When you are dealing with angles instead of lengths, the equivalent tool is a sliding bevel. The simplest sliding bevel would be two sticks joined at one end with a bolt and nut. Traditionally however, a wooden piece is used for one side of the angle and a metal blade for the other. This makes for a much more convenient and versatile tool. The blade has a slot which allows it to slide, hence the name.\nIn the past, woodworkers made their tools themselves, or at least some of them. Aside from their practical use, these tools were made in such a way as to showcase the skill of the woodworker. A sliding bevel is perfect for this purpose: It is relatively small, easy to make and the maker can with relative ease add \"bells and whistles\" to showcase his skills.\nDuring the last 3 years, I have made around 10 sliding bevels, including those I made for the previous instructable. In case you wonder why anyone would want not one but two or even more sliding bevels, there are many reasons. First of all, of course, the practical one: Some videos and pictures shot while making the first one did not come out very well, so I preferred to make a second attempt. Secondly, a nice sliding bevel makes a great gift for a woodworker friend. Alternatively, you can sell them (I have several for sale in my my etsy shop, some similar to the one made in this instructable and others, more expensive, similar to the ones I made in the previous one). Last but not least, it is sometimes useful to have more than one, especially if they have different sizes. If you don't believe me on this point, check this: In the first picture of p. 67, you 'll see that the famous toolbox of Henry O. Studley contained not one, not two, but three sliding bevels. Of course, Henry O. Studley was the ultimate tool junky, so you don't need three sliding bevels just because he was using three...\nA sliding bevel can also be used for metal work. Once you get acquainted with it, you 'll find that it will become your tool of choice whenever you need to transfer an angle - be it from another piece, from a design or even from a protractor.\nA sliding bevel consists of 4 parts: A wooden body, a metal blade, a bolt and a nut. In the previous instructable, I made all four parts. In this one I only made the wooden body. I used a shop bought nut and bolt and the blade from a shop-bought sliding bevel. I did fine-tune the bolt and blade, so they would be more to my liking.\nWARNING!\nWoodworking, as well as metalworking, are inherently dangerous activities. Before starting almost every operation, especially those that involve power tools, you must ask yourself two questions:\nWhat could go wrong here?\nHow can I prevent this?\nWhenever using a power tool, you need to make sure that the tool and the workpiece are held securely. Do not use a tool if you are not comfortable with its operation. Do not rush things. In cases where there are hidden risks, I will indicate this clearly with a \"watch out!\" section in the respective step.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/A-Simpler-Sliding-Bevel-for-Woodworking/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "a simpler sliding bevel for woodworking__i have already posted an instructable on making a sliding bevel, so you may ask why on earth i would be posting a second one. after all, there are more things one can do than sliding bevels, right?\nthere are a few valid answers to that question.\nfirst of all, the sliding bevel shown in my first instructable, although it is a beauty (if i may say so myself), takes a heck of a lot of time to make.\nsecond and most important, in order to make it i used a heck of a lot of tools. now there is nothing wrong with using tools if you have them, but the point of instructables is to show others how to make something. an instructable that begins with \"go get yourself a metal lathe and a milling machine\" especially when addressed to a woodworker (amateur or otherwise), which i believe is the main target group of this, is not very useful. so here is my simpler version, which requires nothing more exotic than a bench bandsaw (sorry, the bandsaw is pretty much necessary, unless you are a handsaw wiz).\nthird, there is a \"modify it\" speed challenge on and i thought i would show you how i modify a shop-bought, bottom of the line sliding bevel with a plastic body and mediocre hardware into a beautiful -----> tool !!!

The idea is that it is easy to make measuring mistakes, but much more difficult to fix them once you have used the (bad) measurement for cutting a piece.\nSo, measuring once is bad. \u039ceasuring twice is better. Even better, however, is not measuring at all. Or at least, not using numbers for measuring, opting instead to transfer the measurement directly from one piece to another. This is the idea behind \"story sticks\", and it works well.\nWhen you are dealing with angles instead of lengths, the equivalent tool is a sliding bevel. The simplest sliding bevel would be two sticks joined at one end with a bolt and nut. Traditionally however, a wooden piece is used for one side of the angle and a metal blade for the other. This makes for a much more convenient and versatile tool. The blade has a slot which allows it to slide, hence the name.\nIn the past, woodworkers made their tools themselves, or at least some of them. Aside from their practical use, these tools were made in such a way as to showcase the skill of the woodworker. A sliding bevel is perfect for this purpose: It is relatively small, easy to make and the maker can with relative ease add \"bells and whistles\" to showcase his skills.\nIn the course of making this instructable, I made 2 complete sliding bevels as well as parts for more. In case you wonder why anyone would want not one but two or even more sliding bevels, there are many reasons. First of all, of course, the practical one: Some videos and pictures shot while making the first one did not come out very well, so I preferred to make a second attempt. Secondly, a nice sliding bevel makes a great gift for a woodworker friend. Alternatively, you can sell them (I have several for sale in my my etsy shop, some similar to the one made in this instructable and some simpler ). Last but not least, it is sometimes useful to have more than one, especially if they have different sizes. If you don't believe me on this point, check this: In the first picture of p. 67, you 'll see that the famous toolbox of Henry O. Studley contained not one, not two, but three sliding bevels. Of course, Henry O. Studley was the ultimate tool junky, so you don't need three sliding bevels just because he was using three...\nA sliding bevel can also be used for metal work. Once you get acquainted with it, you 'll find that it will become your tool of choice whenever you need to transfer an angle - be it from another piece, from a design or even from a protractor.\nAs you will see in the last picture, the sliding bevel consists of 4 parts: A wooden body, a metal blade, a bolt and a nut. I made all four parts, but if you don't have a lathe you can use a shop-bought bolt and nut instead of making them. In this case, I would suggest a brass bolt with a hex head and a brass wing nut.\nNote 2020-10-26: If you would like to make a sliding bevel but do not have the equipment needed for this build, please have a look at the new instructable I just posted: A simpler sliding bevel for woodworking.\nWARNING!\nWoodworking, as well as metalworking, are inherently dangerous activities. Before starting almost every operation, especially those that involve power tools, you must ask yourself two questions:\nWhat could go wrong here?\nHow can I prevent this?\nWhenever using a power tool, you need to make sure that the tool and the workpiece are held securely.\nDo not use a tool if you are not comfortable with its operation.

About a year ago I created a digital multi-tool. While that tool does feature a lot of different modes, for me, the most common and useful are the level and angle measuring modes. So, I thought it would be productive to make a new, more compact tool focused only on angle sensing. The assembly is straight forward, so hopefully it will be a fun weekend project for people.\nI've also designed a sled to hold the level while using the cross-line laser. It can be adjusted by +/-4 degrees in y/x to help level the laser line. The sled can also be mounted on a camera tripod.\nYou can find all of the files needed for the level at my Github: here.\nThe level has five modes:\n(You can see these in the video above. Seeing them will probably make more sense than reading the descriptions)\nX-Y Level: This is like a circular bubble level. With the level laying on it's back, the mode reports the tilt angles about the tool's upper/lower and left/right faces.\nRoll Level: This is like a regular spirit level. With the level standing upright on its upper/lower/left/right, it reports the angle of tilt of the level's top/bottom faces.\nProtractor: Like the roll level, but the level is lying flat on it's bottom face.\nLaser Pointer: Just a straight forward dot laser, projected from the right face of the tool.\nCross-Line Laser: Projects a cross from right face of the level. This can also be activated when using the X-Y Level or Roll Level modes by double tapping the \"Z\" button. Should be oriented such that the bottom face is aligned with the laser line.\nTo make the level more compact, and assembly easier, I've incorporated all the parts onto a custom PCB. The smallest components are 0805 SMD size, which can be easily soldered by hand.\nThe level's case is 3D printed, and measures 74x60x23.8mm with the cross-line laser, 74x44x23.8mm without, making the tool comfortably pocket sized in either case.\nThe level is powered by a rechargeable LiPo battery. I should note that LiPo's can be dangerous if handled improperly. The main thing is not to short the LiPo, but you should do some safety research if you are completely unfamiliar with them.\nFinally, the two lasers I use are very low powered, and while I do not recommend pointing them directly at your eyes, they should be safe otherwise.\nIf you have any questions at all, please leave a comment, and I'll get back to you.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/Digital-Level-With-Cross-Line-Laser/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "digital level with cross-line laser__hi everyone, today i'm going to show you how to make a digital level with optional integrated cross-line laser. about a year ago i created a digital multi------> tool !!! . while that tool does feature a lot of different modes, for me, the most common and useful are the level and angle measuring modes. so, i thought it would be productive to make a new, more compact tool focused only on angle sensing. the assembly is straight forward, so hopefully it will be a fun weekend project for people.\ni've also designed a sled to hold the level while using the cross-line laser. it can be adjusted by +/-4 degrees in y/x to help level the laser line. the sled can also be mounted on a camera tripod.\nyou can find all of the files needed for the level at my github: here.\nthe level has five modes:\n(you can see these in the video above. seeing them will probably make more sense than reading the descriptions)\nx-y level: this is like a circular bubble level. with the level laying on it's back, the mode reports the tilt angles about the tool's upper/lower and left/right faces.\nroll level: this is like a regular spirit level. with the level standing upright on its upper/lower/left/right, it reports the angle of tilt of the level's top/bottom faces.\nprotractor: like the roll level, but the level is lying flat on it's bottom face.\nlaser pointer: just a straight forward dot laser, projected from the right face of the tool.\ncross-line laser: projects a cross from right face of the level. this can also be activated when using the x-y level or roll level modes by double tapping the \"z\" button. should be oriented such that the bottom face is aligned with the laser line.\nto make the level more compact, and assembly easier, i've incorporated all the parts onto a custom pcb. the smallest components are 0805 smd size, which can be easily soldered by hand.\nthe level's case is 3d printed, and measures 74x60x23.8mm with the cross-line laser, 74x44x23.8mm without, making the tool comfortably pocket sized in either case.\nthe level is powered by a rechargeable lipo battery. i should note that lipo's can be dangerous if handled improperly. the main thing is not to short the lipo, but you should do some safety research if you are completely unfamiliar with them.\nfinally, the two lasers i use are very low powered, and while i do not recommend pointing them directly at your eyes, they should be safe otherwise.\nif you have any questions at all, please leave a comment, and i'll get back to you.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "6.0K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7908614, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8619, "autor": "doozer_not_fraggle", "date": null, "content": "Overhead Mobile Gantry Crane Build (A Tool for Lifting Heavy Things)__Do you need to lift heavy things?

It's useful for top dressing your lawn, moving and leveling gravel, and works better than a landscaping rake when it comes to distributing soil evenly. The way that it is design allows for a back and forth motion to quickly distribute soil.\nA very useful tool for those trying to level low spots in their yard or spread new top dressing. The biggest problem with getting one of these rakes is the outrageous cost. A small 17\" x 10\" rake will run you around $65 and for a 30\" x 10\" take expect to pay around $150. I wasn't convinced that a rake made out of a few pieces of stainless steel channels and angles were worth that much so I decided to see if I could create my own.\nI did a lot of searching around the internet and although I found a lot of DIY solutions there weren't any that I was super happy with so I decided to make my own with inspiration from different sources.\nI am not a welder, I don't own any welding equipment, and didn't want to spend a ton of money on this project and I wanted to be able to create something that any average person can make with simple tools and easily accessible parts. After looking around I stumbled on the website onlinemetals.com which allowed you to purchase pre-cut pieces of metal in many different lengths and wasn't incredibly expensive. I am sure that if you went to your local home improvement store and bought/cut the metal pieces yourself it'd be even cheaper. I didn't have the tools to do so when I began the project.\nAll the parts will roughly come out to $50-60 assuming you have the nuts and bolts and if you order the metal pieces precut from the site. The size of rake thst you can make for that price will be 24\" x 12\". Throw in an extra $10 or so and you can make a 48\" x 12\" rake if you wanted. The bigger you make the rake the more savings when compared to buying one.\nThe metal pieces are all aluminum which means it's really light, the thickness of the metal is 16 awg so it's thick enough for pushing dirt and gravel around. I've not seen any flex even while pushing large amounts of gravel. When I made my take I went with aluminum that only had a width of about 0.5\", if I were to do this again I would go with 1\" wide channels and angles due to the fact that you'll need to drill holes that are between 8mm to 10mm and at 0.5\" It's pretty close to the walls.\nThe most difficult to find and important parts needed for this project was the broom adapter and bracket that swivels and connects the rake to the handle. I tried a bunch of different solutions which didn't work out, the best thing that I could find was a bracket made by Kraft Tools which was about $15 for both pieces.\nAgain, because I don't have any welding skills everything is held together by counter sunk M5 bolts. The bracket attached to the rake is held by M8 counter sunk bolts.

And the filament size is also another big difference from other 3D printers. Ultimaker uses a 2.85mm filament system in contrast with 1.75mm filament that most of FDM 3D printers use. So I wanted to develop a 12V RAMPS based \u2018Ultimaker Style 3D printer\u2019 with 1.75mm filament for more compatible and expandable design.\nSo, I made design principles and objectives as follows.\nCost under 600$\nBuild volume 300*300*300mm with minimum machine size\nUtilize the most popular RepRap based parts\nEasy to upgrade and change parts\nPrevious designs inspired me to start this project.\n\u2022 You can find all the open-source files about \u2018Ultimaker 2\u2019 on GitHub.\nhttps://github.com/Ultimaker/Ultimaker2\n\u2022 In May 2015, \u2018jasonatepaint\u2019 introduced his \u2018Ultimaker 2 Aluminum Extrusion Clone\u2019 on thingiverse.com.

My aim with this project was to make a pocket knife which is legal in the UK (non-locking blade less than 3 inches long), looks nice and is a pleasure to use.\nI wanted the best quality blade possible, so I chose a tool steel that met my requirements (D2) and I carefully controlled the heat treatment procedure to produce a blade with a hardness of 60-61 HRC. I used stabilised Red Mallee burr wood for the scales which I dovetailed in place to prevent the scales from warping. I used titanium 6/4 for the spring due to its excellent anti-corrosion properties, elasticity and excellent fatigue resistance. I used commercially pure (CP) titanium for the bolsters to reduce weight over a more conventional material such as brass while still maintaining corrosion resistance. The advantage of using CP rather than an alloy such as 6/4 for the bolsters is simply down to its workability since there is no requirement for high strength. Previous experimentation demonstrated the need for brass liners to maintain a smooth blade action when opening and closing the knife (titanium tended to bind to the blade). The knife is riveted together using a combination of stainless steel rod and brass rod as rivets. To finish it off, I engraved my name in the spring for a touch of personalisation.\nEnjoy!
