Perhaps, it would be beneficial to integrate, for example, Solar Panels in rotation with Vertical Wind Turbines or with Hydraulic Generation Systems and possibly, in a Radar system operated by the energy of the Sun. Experimenting with Solar Panels in Rotation motion could be the initial steps to try such integrations in future projects.\nSome time ago, I published: \"Toy car with Solar Panel Wheel\", a kind of toy car where its propulsion system consisted of a wheel (round solar panel) coupled to the \u201cstator\u201d of a small electric motor. Some elements I think could be improved in that project. One difficulty that I found in my experiments with this toy car was the vertical position of the Solar Panel with respect to the ground, which constitutes an impediment to the optimal use of Solar Radiation and the little torque that is obtained between the wheel and the road, making it very difficult to start running in certain areas. These electric motors generally operate at relatively high rotational speeds. If greater strength is desired, it is necessary to resort to mechanisms with mechanical gears or similar technologies.\nIn this Instructable I offer the steps that I followed for the construction of another toy, also with a Rotating Solar Panel, but implementing certain changes and improvements. Its design is unconventional. For example, the electric motor is arranged in a vertical position with respect to the ground and not horizontal as is generally the case. The Solar Panel is coupled to the body of the electric motor and not to its rotor shaft (in this way, the cables of the panel are not tangled during rotation). A gear is also attached to the body of the motor and this has a direct action on the wheel, which is also a gear! A slightly crazy design that like all have pros and cons.\nWith the interaction with this toy, the youths could approach the elementary understanding of different knowledge:\n--- Use of Solar Energy in propulsion systems\n--- The relativity of the states of motion of bodies\n---Principle of action and reaction (if you stop the axis of a moving motor, its body could begin to rotate if it is not properly supported)\n--- Gears and mechanical transmission mechanisms and how to use them depending on the design objectives\n--- Axles and wheels\n--- Inversion of the direction of Rotation of an electric motor of these characteristics\n--- Physical quantities and physical phenomena such as Force, Torque, Mass, Inertia, Force of gravity, Center of mass, etc.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/TOY-TRACTOR-WITH-ROTATING-SOLAR-PANEL-AND-SPUR-GEA/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "tractor", "selectorShort": "tractor", "MarkedSent": "toy -----> tractor !!!  with rotating solar panel and spur gear wheel__the possible benefits that could be derived from solar panels in rotation movement continue to call my attention. perhaps, it would be beneficial to integrate, for example, solar panels in rotation with vertical wind turbines or with hydraulic generation systems and possibly, in a radar system operated by the energy of the sun. experimenting with solar panels in rotation motion could be the initial steps to try such integrations in future projects.\nsome time ago, i published: \"toy car with solar panel wheel\", a kind of toy car where its propulsion system consisted of a wheel (round solar panel) coupled to the \u201cstator\u201d of a small electric motor. some elements i think could be improved in that project. one difficulty that i found in my experiments with this toy car was the vertical position of the solar panel with respect to the ground, which constitutes an impediment to the optimal use of solar radiation and the little torque that is obtained between the wheel and the road, making it very difficult to start running in certain areas. these electric motors generally operate at relatively high rotational speeds. if greater strength is desired, it is necessary to resort to mechanisms with mechanical gears or similar technologies.\nin this instructable i offer the steps that i followed for the construction of another toy, also with a rotating solar panel, but implementing certain changes and improvements. its design is unconventional. for example, the electric motor is arranged in a vertical position with respect to the ground and not horizontal as is generally the case. the solar panel is coupled to the body of the electric motor and not to its rotor shaft (in this way, the cables of the panel are not tangled during rotation). a gear is also attached to the body of the motor and this has a direct action on the wheel, which is also a gear! a slightly crazy design that like all have pros and cons.\nwith the interaction with this toy, the youths could approach the elementary understanding of different knowledge:\n--- use of solar energy in propulsion systems\n--- the relativity of the states of motion of bodies\n---principle of action and reaction (if you stop the axis of a moving motor, its body could begin to rotate if it is not properly supported)\n--- gears and mechanical transmission mechanisms and how to use them depending on the design objectives\n--- axles and wheels\n--- inversion of the direction of rotation of an electric motor of these characteristics\n--- physical quantities and physical phenomena such as force, torque, mass, inertia, force of gravity, center of mass, etc.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "3.2K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7904782, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 7022, "autor": "ruudcreates", "date": null, "content": "Adjustable Baby Climber - Pikler Triangle__My son is a little monkey and climbs on everything these days.
