Today, I made a mousetrap car. It is made out of recycled materials, and it is a car that is propelled by a mouse trap and string wrapped around the axle of the car(wheel axle movement). While there are other amazing tutorials on instructables for mousetrap cars, this one is specifically designed for beginners. I have gone through many struggles while building this car, and I have some great tips and suggestions to make your car go faster, and further.

Robots that could mimic the act of athletes like runners and, gymnasts. Such robots are extremely interesting for robotics enthusiasts, makers, and inventors. One of the sports and recreation activities that attract boys and girls, young and adults are ziplining. Ziplines are designed to transfer cargo or a person from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable. The cargo or the person is propelled by gravity and moves on the cable through a freely rotating pulley. The zipline robot that we are going to make looks like a monkey that moves on a cable by using its two arms. Making such a creature that uses its arms for locomotion on a cable is a challenging task. However, in this tutorial, we are going to make a fun and easy-to-build zipline robot with Lego Technic components, an Arduino board, and some off-the-shelf electromechanical components. The instructions are prepared in a way that you can build them at home.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/A-DIY-Zipline-Robot-With-Arduino-Lego-and-3D-Print/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "propelled", "selectorShort": "propel", "MarkedSent": "a diy zipline robot with arduino, 3d printed, and lego-compatible parts__introduction\nhave you ever thought of robots that are involved in sports and recreation activities? robots that could mimic the act of athletes like runners and, gymnasts. such robots are extremely interesting for robotics enthusiasts, makers, and inventors. one of the sports and recreation activities that attract boys and girls, young and adults are ziplining. ziplines are designed to transfer cargo or a person from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable. the cargo or the person is -----> propelled !!!  by gravity and moves on the cable through a freely rotating pulley. the zipline robot that we are going to make looks like a monkey that moves on a cable by using its two arms. making such a creature that uses its arms for locomotion on a cable is a challenging task. however, in this tutorial, we are going to make a fun and easy-to-build zipline robot with lego technic components, an arduino board, and some off-the-shelf electromechanical components. the instructions are prepared in a way that you can build them at home.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "2.3K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7908708, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8714, "autor": "More by the author:", "date": null, "content": "Jet Propelled Radio Controlled Duck__40+ years ago I wanted to get a radio control boat and use it on the nearby Park Lake, however the Park Keeper made it quite clear that no boats would be allowed.
