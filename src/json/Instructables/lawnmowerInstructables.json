Langer", "date": null, "content": "Ballistic Engineering: Online and Face-to-face STEAM Lessons for Kids__(For Miguel, Julian and all my former colleagues in C.I. Miguel Caballero S.A.S. Thanks for the bulletproof memories!)\nHello! My name is Mario. I'm a STEAM teacher and a Maker. But during five months of my life, I had the privilege of working in one of the strangest places ever: a famous bulletproof clothes company.\nHow strange was that place? Well, imagine a factory where fancy bulletproof clothes are created for presidents and personalities, body armor for law enforcement officers, and heavy plates for military aircraft and small naval ships. It was like working in Q's laboratory and living in a \"Mythbusters\" marathon of only gun-related-myths episodes, all at the same time. I was in charge of the ballistic and quality test of the products. Even I was shot by my boss with a Magnum, a well-known tradition in that company (don't worry! I never show this video to my students.)\nNow, as a STEAM teacher, I like to apply some of my little experience in that area, and teach my students (kids age 8-14 years old) about BALLISTICS!\nWait! Don't run away! Ballistics is not only weapons and forensics! I'm not training your kids to be assassins! (that would be cool, but not very ethical...)\nBallistics is basically the part of Physics that studies the launching, flight behavior and impact effects of projectiles. Probably your kids are already learning that in the curriculum of their school, specially in the part of gravity, velocity and trajectory of launched objects. And several classic STEAM projects use ballistics (catapults, marshmallow shooters, blowguns, bottle rockets, crossbows, and so on). However, a lot of teachers don't like to use the word \"ballistics\" because we are exposed mostly to the violent connotation of that word (\"a ballistic missile was launched\", \"we are waiting for the ballistic analysis on the crime scene\"). Ballistics is not only about launching a projectile, but also about how to stop it before it causes any serious damage.\nThis area has several real world applications, like:\nSports: ballistics helps to understand how our favorite soccer or baseball player hits a ball and the forces acting over it. Also, it helps to design better balls, sport shoes and protection equipment to reduce the risks of trauma in catchers.\nSafety: any projected thing can become a projectile: a brick falling from a construction, a pebble hit by a lawnmower, an asteroid coming from the space. Even a bird flying against an airplane or a biker being projected from his motorbike during an accident behave like projectiles when they crash at that speed. Understanding ballistics helps scientist, engineers and designers to create better protection equipment and more resistant structures and materials for those situations.\nSpace Exploration: well, you cannot design and launch a rocket without a deep knowledge in ballistics. Also, your starships, satellites and martian rovers need to be designed to resist the impact from meteoroids and space junk.\nMilitary, Law enforcement and personal protection: obviously, ballistics are involved not only in weapons design, but also en body armor to protect the lives of the persons exposed to that risk: cops, soldiers, humanitarian organizations deactivating landmines, bodyguards, presidents, and Steven Seagal (don't ask.)\nForensics: probably the most popular application thanks to \"CSI\". Useful to determinate the homicide weapon, ammunition, angle, distance and all that technical blablabla we hear in the news channel and TV series.\nRescue: helmets to protect firefighters and life guards. By the way, have you seen those sweet Batman-like line throwing guns used by rescuers during floods? BOOM! Ballistics!\nIn this instructable I will teach two STEAM Ballistic Engineering activities for kids age 8 to 14 years old. These activities have been tested with success:\nAir-powered Cannon (online lesson): this project will focus in the traditional application of ballistics (launching a projectile). I won't go deep in theory there, because as it was mentioned before, this is covered by Physics curriculum and hands-on projects. However, I will explain how this activity was created specifically for distance learning during pandemic times.\nBallistic Protection Challenge (face-to-face lesson): Hopefully, the pandemic will be over on next year; schools will return to normality and we can do again this lesson. In this activity, the teacher will create a spring-powered launcher, and kids will be challenged to create a paper structure strong enough to stop the projectile before it hits an action figure. It's a risky activity, but with adequate safety measures, it's a fun one.\n(DISCLAIMER: Some of the activities described in this instructable, specifically the second part \"Ballistic Protection Challenge\", involve shooting fast plastic projectiles in a classroom, with some risk of wounds and injuries. Follow all safety measures during all the steps of this activity and always use protective equipment.
