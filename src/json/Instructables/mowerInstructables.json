The process was easy, took very little time, cost almost nothing ($3 for a pack of 10\u201d bamboo skewers) and was very accurate.\nGetting a new pull behind leaf vacuum can be an exciting event, until you realize you will need to cut the universal vacuum hose adapter for the mower deck yourself. For some mower decks, you might be able to cutout a simple rectangular opening. For most lawn mower decks the task can be quite challenging. Unfortunately, my mower deck fell in the category of the latter \u2013 complicated \u2013 and thus the reason for this Instructable.\nSince there are so many different versions and sizes of mower decks available, it would be near impossible for manufacturers to supply templates for mower decks.

The written instructions for this task are rather sparse and videos tend to be vague when it comes to the actual process.
