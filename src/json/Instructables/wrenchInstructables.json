The reason I wanted to make this was so that I could easily change the nozzle on my 3d printer. My Ender 3 came with a small 5mm wrench to remove the nozzle but since you have to change the nozzle when its hot it can be a little intimidating to do so with a tiny wrench. Also the wrench loosens the nozzle but doesn't hold it so you either have to put on a glove and catch the hot nozzle or just let it drop. I have a screwdriver/nut driver but it has a long handle and I have to raise the printer head all the way up in order to have enough room for the screwdriver to fit. So I knew I wanted a stubby screwdriver something that was small enough to store in my 3d printer tool box too. I decided to use a Craftsman screw driver as my model because I like the size and shape and how it feels in the hand.\nOriginally I was just going to make one or two but I have to admit the molding and casting process was so much fun that I made several different colors.
