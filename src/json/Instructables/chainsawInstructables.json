Sometimes chainsaw bars are referred to as arms, blades or swords, but I'll simply stick to using the official term which is chainsaw bar.\nNote: this applies to bar sizes for large Stihl and Husqvarna saws - Stihl 3003 bar to Husqvarna D009 mount chainsaw. The opposite doesn't apply, at least not without significant modification to the bar, so we won't discuss that here. Also, this is NOT the only way to make this modification, but this mod allows you to buy standard length chains available on the shelf without needing to have special length chains made.\nSo, why use a Stihl on a Husqvarna chainsaw? In my case, Stihl chains are easier to acquire and I already have a large quantity on hand, so I save money by not buying more chains. Also, in the case you have both manufacturer's saws, it allows you to interchange the bars and chains. Stihl's new bars are superior to other manufacturer's these days. The quality of their chains is also very high, so they are desirable to use in home and professional settings.\nWhy not just use Stihl chain on a Husqvarna bar? Husqvarna uses as a standard driver width .058 and Stihl uses .063, so the Stihl chain won't fit into the Husqvarna bar groove. There are other options and driver sizes, but again we won't discuss that here for the purpose of keeping this instructable simple and not confusing.\nFirst, let me explain the differences in the two bar mounts that the different manufacturer's use. Stihl uses larger shoulders on the mount bolts, therefore, the bar opening is much larger than Husqvarna's. Husqvarna mount bolts are further apart in spacing, so the slot for the bar is longer than Stihl's. So, I'll show you how to overcome those differences to easily mount a Stihl bar on a Husqvarna saw.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Use-a-Stihl-Chainsaw-Bar-on-a-Husqvarna-Saw/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "chainsaw", "selectorShort": "chainsaw", "MarkedSent": "how to use a stihl -----> chainsaw !!!  bar on a husqvarna saw__in this instructable i'll show you the basics of using a stihl bar and chain on a husqvarna chainsaw. sometimes chainsaw bars are referred to as arms, blades or swords, but i'll simply stick to using the official term which is chainsaw bar.\nnote: this applies to bar sizes for large stihl and husqvarna saws - stihl 3003 bar to husqvarna d009 mount chainsaw. the opposite doesn't apply, at least not without significant modification to the bar, so we won't discuss that here. also, this is not the only way to make this modification, but this mod allows you to buy standard length chains available on the shelf without needing to have special length chains made.\nso, why use a stihl on a husqvarna chainsaw? in my case, stihl chains are easier to acquire and i already have a large quantity on hand, so i save money by not buying more chains. also, in the case you have both manufacturer's saws, it allows you to interchange the bars and chains. stihl's new bars are superior to other manufacturer's these days. the quality of their chains is also very high, so they are desirable to use in home and professional settings.\nwhy not just use stihl chain on a husqvarna bar? husqvarna uses as a standard driver width .058 and stihl uses .063, so the stihl chain won't fit into the husqvarna bar groove. there are other options and driver sizes, but again we won't discuss that here for the purpose of keeping this instructable simple and not confusing.\nfirst, let me explain the differences in the two bar mounts that the different manufacturer's use. stihl uses larger shoulders on the mount bolts, therefore, the bar opening is much larger than husqvarna's. husqvarna mount bolts are further apart in spacing, so the slot for the bar is longer than stihl's. so, i'll show you how to overcome those differences to easily mount a stihl bar on a husqvarna saw.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "945", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7905734, "year": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 7502, "autor": "MattL152", "date": null, "content": "Wooden Chainsaw Mill__At the end of the summer, a hurricane plowed through my area and knocked down a ton of trees.\nI hated to see all of that wood go to waste and wanted a way to harvest some of it for future use.\nUsing only materials I had on hand, I assembled a chainsaw mill inspired by Izzy Swan's videos.\nYou can follow this exactly or make modifications.\nSAFETY:\nChainsaws are built to remove a lot of material quickly.
