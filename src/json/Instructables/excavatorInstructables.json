I thought about building a sandbox excavator and looked up some designs online. I didn't like the designs of the sandbox excavators you can buy, because they are only moving the lower arm, but not the scoop (and most off them look very wobbly)\nI wanted to have a design where the scoop is turning inwards to get a more realistic movement of the excavator. Since you can only have two handle bars to manually control the movement of the excavator, the scoop movement had to be connected to the lower arm. To design this I used Fusion 360.\nI have actually planed to finish this project before christmas. Due to another lockdown in Austria, this will not be possible. I still have to finish some final steps, but most of the work is done. So I thought I could already publish this instructable.", "link": "https://www.instructables.com/Metal-Sandbox-Excavator-With-Realistic-Scooping-Mo/", "origin": "Instructables", "suborigin": "Instructables", "result": true, "Selector": "excavator", "selectorShort": "excavator", "MarkedSent": "metal sandbox -----> excavator !!!  with realistic scooping motion__a few month ago i started welding and was looking for a first project to practice it. i thought about building a sandbox excavator and looked up some designs online. i didn't like the designs of the sandbox excavators you can buy, because they are only moving the lower arm, but not the scoop (and most off them look very wobbly)\ni wanted to have a design where the scoop is turning inwards to get a more realistic movement of the excavator. since you can only have two handle bars to manually control the movement of the excavator, the scoop movement had to be connected to the lower arm. to design this i used fusion 360.\ni have actually planed to finish this project before christmas. due to another lockdown in austria, this will not be possible. i still have to finish some final steps, but most of the work is done. so i thought i could already publish this instructable.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "Nan", "score": "5.8K", "comments": null, "media": null, "medialink": null, "identifyer": 7906761, "year": null}], "name": "excavatorInstructables"}
