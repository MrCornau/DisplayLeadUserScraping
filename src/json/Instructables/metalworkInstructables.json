years ago!\nWell here I am again, this time, bringing you along with me, on a journey to make an orange peeler out of scrap steel.\nSkip the story if you just want to get straight to creating!!\n~~STORY~~\nI collect steel scraps from projects and try to put them to use - a while ago, I started adding fresh oranges to my work lunch and I found it quite painful to carry a sharp knife in my insulated crib bag as none of my knives have proper pouches and I don't want them cutting up my bag.\nI had bought a forge a fair while ago and thought it would be cool to try my hand at metalwork for a change and actually focus on one thing, but I wanted it to be different.\nI have always wondered since I was a child, how hard is blacksmithing?\nObviously, unless you're a prodigy or have had access to extensive training and courses, it would be pretty difficult - google searches don't quite cover these types of questions fully so I thought I would try and find out myself.\nI have already tried and failed at making a knife (simply because it was my very first thing I tried forging) and I wanted to make something practical that didn't need to be super straight and perfect.\nI tried to think of all the things I could make that I would use and I remembered my older brother used to have an orange peeler many years ago when we used tot ravel but it got lost.\nWhen I found instructables from my google search, I thought I would have a peek at the contests and if I could enter any, and that is how I came up with the idea to make another orange peeler from scrap.\n(If everyone is interested, I might upload a photo of the original orange peeler I made)\nSince I used my orange peeler everyday and and knowing I didn't need 2 peelers, I contacted a friend of mine and a good camping buddy and asked him if he would use an orange peeler and eat more oranges at work and he is super keen to try out the design!\nIn the end, we both now have orange peelers and I plan on
