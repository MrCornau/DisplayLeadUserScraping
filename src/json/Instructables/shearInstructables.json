Instead of sending seeds to the trash at the end of the growing season, in this Instructable I'll describe the fun and easy way to save seeds to plant next year.\nMy love for gardens, especially flower gardens, began when as a child, I helped my grandmother plant, tend, weed, and harvest her gardens. As we worked, she shared with me gardening know-how that she had acquired during her years growing flowers, fruits, herbs, and veggies. At home, my Dad and Mom planted a small grove of fruit trees, grew most of our fresh vegetables in the backyard garden, and lined the perimeter of our yard with flowers that bloomed from spring until fall.\nA favorite take-away for me from these early lessons in horticulture are the marigolds pictured here. My grandmother began growing marigolds in the late 1930s. Each fall, she collected and dried marigold seeds and replanted them the following spring. More than 90 years and many flower generations later and as my mom did, I carry on my grandmother's tradition each year when I spread the seeds, planting the new crop.\nMarigolds are not alone when it comes to drying seeds in the fall to plant the following year. In addition to perennials, bulbs, and tuberous plants, my flower gardens bloom with a large variety of colorful, mostly pest resistant flowers each year from seeds that I gathered the previous fall.\nSupplies\nSupplies needed are minimal.
