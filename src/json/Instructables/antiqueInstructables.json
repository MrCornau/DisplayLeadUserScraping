You're curious and insert your finger inside the hole, there is some light shining on your finger, you feel that your finger is getting scanned and think it might be one of those fortune teller machines that were popular back in the day.

The Quantum Death Machine is powered by a raspberry pi, a thermal printer, and a fingerprint scanner. When someone puts their finger on the scanner, instructions of a quantum circuit(a quantum dice) are sent to an actual quantum computer by IBM. A prompt from a DeathList is then selected based on the quantum dice result and gets printed on thermal paper.\nInspiration\nEver since I took Quantum Mechanics in university I wanted to use it somehow on one of my projects. After taking an online course on Quantum Computation by IBM I was introduced to the world of Quantum Computing. After finishing the course, the first thing that came to my mind was to make a project that uses an actual quantum computer. The first project Idea I had was to build an 8ball but with Halloween approaching I decided to make a spookier project.\nI primarily wanted to use the True Randomness of quantum computers by creating a quantum dice because it's a good and easy introduction to quantum computing and its properties. I also wanted to create an easy-to-follow tutorial for all makers so they can also use quantum computing in their projects.\nThe first idea that came to my mind was to create a Schrodinger's cat inspired box with a twist. Instead of the cat being dead or alive it would be the user who uses the box. It would print dead or alive based on the result from the quantum computer. But while I was researching some combinations of Death Box, Death Machine, etc. I came upon a book which is called the Machine of Death which is an anthology of short stories edited by Ryan North, Matthew Bennardo, and David Malki. In the book, the Machine is described as:\n\"The machine had been invented a few years ago: a machine that could tell, from just a sample of your blood, how you were going to die. The problem with the machine is that nobody really knew how it worked, which wouldn\u2019t actually have been that much of a problem if the machine worked as well as we wished it would. But the machine was frustratingly vague in its predictions\"\nThis gave me a lot of inspiration! I changed the output from Dead/Alive to a list of prompts. And used the result from the quantum computer to choose from the list. I also added a fingerprint scanner to give a personalized feeling. The prompts from the book felt a bit serious so I wrote my own and also asked on social media for people to contribute, thus the Quantum Death Machine was born!\nOutline\nIn the first step, I'll explain the inspiration behind this project. Next, I will give a short introduction to Quantum Computing and provide you with some resources if you want to know more. Then I will show you how to set up your raspberry pi and configure it for the project. Later I will explain how the code works so you use a quantum computer for your own projects.

I've been needing a toy chest for quite a while, and I have been mulling over how to make a metal-bound pirate chest to hold all our loot.\nThis pirate toy chest is made from baltic birch plywood, 3/4-inch thick for the ends, and 1/2-inch thick for the sides and top staves. I also cut five 2-inch wide strips of 1/4-inch plywood that I had left over from another project, to make a partial shelf inside the curved lid of the chest.\nThe toy chest is 36-inches long, 24-inches wide at the top, and tapers down to 16-inches wide at the bottom, and 24-inches tall (16-inches for the bottom part, not counting the wheels and wheel blocks), and the lid is 8-inches tall. The lid is made up of staves, cut at 11 1/2-degree angles to give the chest a rounded top. The chest will be kind of heavy, so I put 1 1/2-inch heavy duty casters underneath. The addition of \"rusty\" metal straps and large-head nails make it look like something from a pirate movie. Antique-looking hardware complete the pirate look. Soft-close air shocks for the lid, make it easier (and safer) to open and close. The final chest weighs around 85-pounds, empty. Thinner or lighter weight plywood, and painted-on straps would have reduced the weight substantially.\nI didn't want to dig to the bottom of this chest to find small toys, so inside there are some half-width trays that slide back and forth on tracks. The upper tray is four inches deep, and the lower tray is three-inches deep. It's a tossup whether these trays actually add more storage space, but they do make it easier to find things.\nThis rolling toy chest is actually part of a larger (but far less complicated) set of built-in shelves that I recently completed.
