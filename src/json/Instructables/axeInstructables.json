This project really gave me an appreciation for what those smiths knew and the hard work that went into making a battle worthy axe. Afterall, not doing a good job in the forge may have resulted in your blade fracturing and costing you your life!\nWhat I made here is a traditional pattern of a Viking \"all purpose axe\" that was used on the farm and in battle. The shape is true to historical axes, very flat across the top with a \"beard\" or curved blade that could be used to hook over walls or a combatant's arm or ankle to gain advantage in battle. I chose to make a Damascus type steel for an artistic look. The small knife in the photo is also a standard Viking shape known as a Seax, that was made off of a cut-off of the Axe's blank and set into an Elk Antler for a handle.\nLet's Get Started!\nSome Really Good Advice: This project is very equipment intensive and very dangerous to the novice and expert alike, so I HIGHLY recommend that the best way to learn what goes into this craft and to result in a really good outcome is to take a forging class! There are at least 317 ways to get seriously injured while making this axe and it is a good idea to have a partner as a teacher and an overseer to remind each other on good safe practices! Good PPE is a must and a clear workspace to move hot steel around the shop.
