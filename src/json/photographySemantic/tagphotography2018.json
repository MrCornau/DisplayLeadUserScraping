So I am by no means a professional.\n\nTheoretically, I hate the idea of featured accounts. People getting followers and, potentially, making money off of other people's creative work without paying a cent to the original creator is complete bullshit. BUT, I also live in the real world and realize that for me, someone without much of an internet following, an account that provides an outlet to reach thousands or sometimes even tens of thousands of followers is good for me so I am willing to play the game. Also, some of these accounts actually foster creative collaboration or are run by seriously talented people, I'm all for those.\n\nBut this is all with a few caveats...

If you don't abide by those rules and you repost my content BUT you clearly label it as my photography and link to my account...well then whatever, I may even turn a blind eye to that because there are bigger issues in the world.

This is quite the saga, unfortunately, but I really feel the need to share my story. I will be sharing it on any site I can find, and as horrible as it sounds, I truly hope that Adorama loses customers because of me.\n\nMy story starts on Friday June 8th. Earlier that week, I had contacted a few camera companies about trading in some of my gear. I wanted to trade in my Canon 6D and my Canon 100-400 lens and buy up to a 5D Mark III. I got quotes from B&amp;H, MPB, and Adorama. The B&amp;H quote was disappointing, as they tend to be. But MPB and Adorama were reasonable values. MPB offered $1180, and Adorama offered $1200 with the option for more if I trade in for something else (which I was planning to do).\n\nI have previous trade-in experience with MPB, and I love them. Their customer service is fantastic, and I was never been disappointed in the product I received. But as far as I know, MPB doesn\u2019t offer additional money for trade-ins. So I decided to go with Adorama.\n\nThis brings us to Friday the 8th. This past weekend (the 15th through the 17th), I was on an astrophotography trip with my boyfriend. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been planning for months. I really wanted to have my new camera in time for this trip; I thought it would be a great learning experience and I would get some great photos out of it. \n\nSo I called Adorama on the 8th and asked them flat out \u2013 if I send in my 6D and lens, will I get the 5D in time for my trip (no later than the 14th). I was repeatedly assured that there would be no issue getting the camera to me in time as long as I shipped my trade-ins on the 8th (I live in MD, so shipping is always really fast from NYC). The customer service rep was very nice and understanding and made multiple reassurances that everything would work out. They said to call on Monday after my package arrived at their facility and ask for expedited processing, and then everything would work out. \n\nSo, excited for my new camera, I shipped out my gear and waited.\n\nMonday morning (the 11th) arrives, and I check on the package. It was delivered, but I waited until the afternoon to call, since I figured it would take some time to get all of their packages unpacked. I called and was told that the package had been received and that it would be unpacked and checked in on Tuesday. Okay. That\u2019s not what I was told before, but I was still assured that everything would work out. They would check it in on Tuesday, do their evaluation, and it would ship out on Wednesday. I live close enough to NYC that I get standard next-day shipping, so it would still arrive on time. Fine, that works.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, I still haven\u2019t heard anything. So I call, and I\u2019m told that my package still hasn\u2019t been unpacked. But that it will definitely get done no later than Wednesday morning and it should still be shipped out on Wednesday. Frankly, I\u2019m starting to get stressed. Every time I call, the story changes a little bit. And each little change is adding up and now I\u2019m at risk of not getting my camera in time.\n\nBut fine. It sounds like this will still work out. So I wait.\n\nWednesday afternoon, I call again. I am told yet again that my package has not been unpacked yet. WHAT? How is this happening? I am beyond frustrated and I\u2019m actually starting to get an attitude with the customer service rep (if you know me, this is a very rare thing). She assures me that the package will go out on Thursday and will arrive Friday morning in time for my trip (we were leaving at 3pm that day).\n\nFine. Whatever. This is ridiculous, but it\u2019s still working out.\n\nThe weird thing is, after hanging up with the customer service rep, I get an email saying that my trade-ins have been evaluated and they want me to call to discuss my options. This is an obvious sign of how messed up their system is since I literally just got off the phone with someone who said that they hadn\u2019t even opened the box yet. But fine. Their system is messed up, but at least it was somewhat working in my favor. So I call.\n\nThey offer me $700 for my camera and lens.\n\nYou see, what I didn\u2019t realize is that when Adorama sends you a quote, they are sending you the resale value of the goods. Not the trade-in value. Or so it was explained to me. So the $1200 value they emailed me the week before was a blatant lie, and they can really just offer whatever crappy value they want after they\u2019ve \u2018evaluated\u2019 your gear. I\u2019m told that there are a couple problems \u2013 the viewpiece of the camera is dirty, and the lens has some haze in it. I also forgot to include the tripod mount for the lens, and they said that they\u2019d pay me for it separately if I ship it in.\n\nBut $700??? THAT\u2019S A $500 CUT FROM THE ORIGINAL OFFER. Unacceptable. But at this point, I\u2019m so desperate to get my new camera in time for my trip that I just accept it. Jack tells me that I\u2019m essentially paying roughly $530 for the 5D after my trade-ins. I\u2019m told that it\u2019s a VERY GOOD model with roughly 51K shutter count. Okay. Fine. Send it. I gave him my credit card number and he processed the transaction. He said that the $530 included the $100 that they were going to give me for sending in the tripod mount, and I asked for guaranteed next-day shipping so that I could get the new camera on Thursday. He agreed, and the total went up to roughly $670. Fine. We hung up.\n\nThat phone call took place around 3pm on Wednesday.\n\nAt 5am on Thursday (the day I\u2019m supposed to be getting my new camera), I get an email saying that my transaction was declined.\n\nIt was declined. And I heard about it over 12 hours later via an automatic email???? \n\nSo I look up the order and find that they entered the expiration date incorrectly. I know this without a doubt, because I am very careful when I share my credit card information. I spoke slowly and clearly, and I have absolutely no doubt that I said \u201cAPRIL,\u201d which sounds absolutely nothing like \u201cNOVEMBER.\u201d\n\nAh, but customer service doesn\u2019t open until 9am. So I sit around and seethe for a few hours, waiting until I can call and complain.\n\n9am rolls around and I\u2019m on the phone. It takes all of 30 seconds to fix the typo and get the transaction approved. I am assured that the package will go out on Thursday and I will have it no later than noon on Friday. The customer service agent is very apologetic, and I just kind of accept that this has all been a horrible stroke of bad luck. But at least I\u2019ll get my camera in time for the trip.\n\nFriday morning comes. I check my order online, and it says that my order is still preparing for shipment. Huh. Seems strange. But perhaps their online system just doesn\u2019t update quickly. There\u2019s no reason why it should still be preparing for shipment when it should be at my door in a few hours. So I wait. Noon comes and goes, and no package.\n\nTime to call Adorama. \n\nSo the shipping department is VERY SORRY, but my package somehow didn\u2019t go out on Friday. It was never even tagged to ship. WHAT. THE. HELL. I\u2019m seeing red. I\u2019m yelling and bitching and complaining. (Side note: I realize that none of this was the customer rep\u2019s fault, and I repeatedly apologized to him for the fact that he was on the receiving end of my anger. But seriously.)\n\nI raised hell. I was so upset that I was crying and yelling. There is no excuse for such horrible service. There is no excuse for the fact that I did far beyond due diligence to get my package in time and it STILL WASN\u2019T HERE. \n\nThey offered me a $50 gift card as an apology.\n\nI swear, I practically deflated. Why should I be surprised? This company that had caused me misery and stress over the last week thought that everything could be made whole with $50. They even said that they'd include next-day shipping for free (which wasn't true -- I'd already paid for it). Resigned, I said it was fine. Give me the $50 and ship my camera. It would arrive on Monday.\n\nI would already be home from my trip by then.\n\nThe customer service rep offered to change the shipping address and have it sent to where I was vacationing. But the thing about astrophotography is that it kind of requires being out in the middle of nowhere. No cell service. No internet. No next-day UPS deliveries. In tears, I called my boyfriend. He was furious and called Adorama back on my behalf. They increased the gift card to $100. They made it sound like some sort of charity. He asked if the $100 could be applied towards this purchase. No, they said. It has to be on a new order.\n\nOf course. Because customer retention, right? \n\nNo. We will spend that $100 and then I absolutely guarantee that Adorama will never see another penny from us.\n\nBut alas. That was the end of it. I wouldn\u2019t have my camera in time for my trip.\n\nI still went. My boyfriend and I had fun. We looked at the stars and admired the milky way. I didn\u2019t take any pictures.\n\nToday is Monday. I received my new (used) camera. It is not in very good condition. It is so badly scratched at the corners that it\u2019s white instead of black. The eyepiece is completely missing. I don\u2019t even have the energy to by angry. After all, this is what I should expect from Adorama. \n\nI regret not using MPB. I would have had my new camera in time for my trip. I would have saved myself a week of misery and stress. I would be sitting here, holding my new camera, excited to start practicing with it.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m writing this review. Unhappy. I don\u2019t even want to touch that camera. It\u2019s just a bad experience waiting to continue.\n\nI am going to call Adorama yet again. I\u2019m going to ask to undo everything that\u2019s been done. I want my 6D back. I want my lens. And I\u2019m going to sell them to MPB. And when I get my new 5D Mark III, I bet it will be amazing. It will be everything I ever wanted, and it will be everything that was advertised. And, if there\u2019s anything wrong with it, I have no doubt that I will experience fantastic customer service.

how is this happening? i am beyond frustrated and i\u2019m actually starting to get an attitude with the customer service rep (if you know me, this is a very rare thing). she assures me that the package will go out on thursday and will arrive friday morning in time for my trip (we were leaving at 3pm that day).\n\nfine. whatever. this is ridiculous, but it\u2019s still working out.\n\nthe weird thing is, after hanging up with the customer service rep, i get an email saying that my trade-ins have been evaluated and they want me to call to discuss my options. this is an obvious sign of how messed up their system is since i literally just got off the phone with someone who said that they hadn\u2019t even opened the box yet. but fine. their system is messed up, but at least it was somewhat working in my favor. so i call.\n\nthey offer me $700 for my camera and lens.\n\nyou see, what i didn\u2019t realize is that when adorama sends you a quote, they are sending you the resale value of the goods. not the trade-in value. or so it was explained to me. so the $1200 value they emailed me the week before was a blatant lie, and they can really just offer whatever crappy value they want after they\u2019ve \u2018evaluated\u2019 your gear. i\u2019m told that there are a couple problems \u2013 the viewpiece of the camera is dirty, and the lens has some haze in it. i also forgot to include the tripod mount for the lens, and they said that they\u2019d pay me for it separately if i ship it in.\n\nbut $700??? that\u2019s a $500 cut from the original offer. unacceptable. but at this point, i\u2019m so desperate to get my new camera in time for my trip that i just accept it. jack tells me that i\u2019m essentially paying roughly $530 for the 5d after my trade-ins. i\u2019m told that it\u2019s a very good model with roughly 51k shutter count. okay. fine. send it. i gave him my credit card number and he processed the transaction. he said that the $530 included the $100 that they were going to give me for sending in the tripod mount, and i asked for guaranteed next-day shipping so that i could get the new camera on thursday. he agreed, and the total went up to roughly $670. fine. we hung up.\n\nthat phone call took place around 3pm on wednesday.\n\nat 5am on thursday (the day i\u2019m supposed to be getting my new camera), i get an email saying that my transaction was declined.\n\nit was declined. and i heard about it over 12 hours later via an automatic email???? \n\nso i look up the order and find that they entered the expiration date incorrectly. i know this without a doubt, because i am very careful when i share my credit card information. i spoke slowly and clearly, and i have absolutely no doubt that i said \u201capril,\u201d which sounds absolutely nothing like \u201cnovember.\u201d\n\nah, but customer service doesn\u2019t open until 9am. so i sit around and seethe for a few hours, waiting until i can call and complain.\n\n9am rolls around and i\u2019m on the phone. it takes all of 30 seconds to fix the typo and get the transaction approved. i am assured that the package will go out on thursday and i will have it no later than noon on friday. the customer service agent is very apologetic, and i just kind of accept that this has all been a horrible stroke of bad luck. but at least i\u2019ll get my camera in time for the trip.\n\nfriday morning comes. i check my order online, and it says that my order is still preparing for shipment. huh. seems strange. but perhaps their online system just doesn\u2019t update quickly. there\u2019s no reason why it should still be preparing for shipment when it should be at my door in a few hours. so i wait. noon comes and goes, and no package.\n\ntime to call adorama. \n\nso the shipping department is very sorry, but my package somehow didn\u2019t go out on friday. it was never even -----> tagged !!!  to ship. what. the. hell. i\u2019m seeing red. i\u2019m yelling and bitching and complaining. (side note: i realize that none of this was the customer rep\u2019s fault, and i repeatedly apologized to him for the fact that he was on the receiving end of my anger. but seriously.)\n\ni raised hell. i was so upset that i was crying and yelling. there is no excuse for such horrible service. there is no excuse for the fact that i did far beyond due diligence to get my package in time and it still wasn\u2019t here. \n\nthey offered me a $50 gift card as an apology.\n\ni swear, i practically deflated. why should i be surprised? this company that had caused me misery and stress over the last week thought that everything could be made whole with $50. they even said that they'd include next-day shipping for free (which wasn't true -- i'd already paid for it). resigned, i said it was fine. give me the $50 and ship my camera. it would arrive on monday.\n\ni would already be home from my trip by then.\n\nthe customer service rep offered to change the shipping address and have it sent to where i was vacationing. but the thing about astrophotography is that it kind of requires being out in the middle of nowhere. no cell service. no internet. no next-day ups deliveries. in tears, i called my boyfriend. he was furious and called adorama back on my behalf. they increased the gift card to $100. they made it sound like some sort of charity. he asked if the $100 could be applied towards this purchase. no, they said. it has to be on a new order.\n\nof course. because customer retention, right? \n\nno. we will spend that $100 and then i absolutely guarantee that adorama will never see another penny from us.\n\nbut alas. that was the end of it. i wouldn\u2019t have my camera in time for my trip.\n\ni still went. my boyfriend and i had fun. we looked at the stars and admired the milky way. i didn\u2019t take any pictures.\n\ntoday is monday. i received my new (used) camera. it is not in very good condition. it is so badly scratched at the corners that it\u2019s white instead of black. the eyepiece is completely missing. i don\u2019t even have the energy to by angry. after all, this is what i should expect from adorama. \n\ni regret not using mpb. i would have had my new camera in time for my trip. i would have saved myself a week of misery and stress. i would be sitting here, holding my new camera, excited to start practicing with it.\n\ninstead, i\u2019m writing this review. unhappy. i don\u2019t even want to touch that camera. it\u2019s just a bad experience waiting to continue.\n\ni am going to call adorama yet again. i\u2019m going to ask to undo everything that\u2019s been done. i want my 6d back. i want my lens. and i\u2019m going to sell them to mpb. and when i get my new 5d mark iii, i bet it will be amazing. it will be everything i ever wanted, and it will be everything that was advertised. and, if there\u2019s anything wrong with it, i have no doubt that i will experience fantastic customer service. because i won\u2019t be using adorama anymore.\n\n\\-----\n\ntdlr; i traded in gear with adorama and had the worst customer service experience of my life. lesson learned: always use mpb.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 21647, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 276241, "autor": "Minewolf20", "date": 1531387496000, "content": "Looking for a camera &lt;1000\u20ac for mixed usage (taking photos and filming) /!/ I'd like to buy my first camera that isn't on a cell phone nor a sports camera.

Inside was my hard disk, 1000 euros, canon 6D, my flash. I decided to file a police report, but it felt somewhat like a lost cause.

I felt this small spark of hope I could still have all my items, but the only thing left was my hard disk, everything else was gone.

Theres a long story of him being a dick and giving poor customer service, but basically she paid $3,200 for 14 photos in a little photo book (10in x 7in I think. Ish.) and he liked, didn't edit, and posted &amp; tagged her mostly negative photos on his social media against her express wishes. Help?\n\nI introduced her to him because I had met him at a Street Fest and talked about the possibility of my partner and I doing a shoot for around $1,000 or $1,200.\n\nI've since gotten through his website and has seen that he charges $3000 for weddings of 150 people or less, so he's charging her more than having to go off location lasting a lot longer.\n\nHe states in his website that all editing and photoshopping is included in cost and done in house, but he was unable to slightly smooth a crease in her neck she found unflattering and to remove a small piece of hair splayed at the wrong angle on a solid colored pillow. He tried to charge them $75 to Outsource the work (???) and sent all the pictures off to the printer in the middle of this conversation without telling them until after anyway so nothing was fixed.\n\nAfter he said he was incapable of photoshopping, my friend said 'In that case that I've taken a Photoshop class A few years ago and was pretty decent and would like to do it herself that night. He said he had no way of sending those photos.
