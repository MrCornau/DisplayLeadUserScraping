The best pods I have seen insist on a specific time to \"drop\" your posts. Then every who has new content for that day posts and comments on everyone else posts. What this does is help your posts be seen by the rest of Instagram, both those who follow you and those who don\u2019t (yet). Each group has its own rules, here are the basics.\n\n 1. Drops happen at the same time everyday. 7pm UK time. \n\n 2. You must like follow and comment on everyone's post that joins the drop that day if you want to join. You have 1 and half hours to comment on all posts. \n\n 3. Comments must be positive, and specific, not just copied and pasted on every post. Comments Must be at least 5 words or more (emoji does not count) This is because pods and thier members are easy to spot if the comments are generic. \n\n 4.

The tele? easy, you don't want to be there when sh*t happens. Trust me on this one. But, be in mind even a 70-200 won't guarantee your safety. \n What about zoom? Good call, if you have it, bring it. it will help you a lot. 24-70 and a 70-200 can be your best friends.\n\nb) rallies\n   Almost calm, you can spot a good amount of children and having fun, police will surround all the encounter as a safety manobre. Stay calm, almost nothing happens at those kind of stuff. focus on not being in their patch, do your job.\n\nc) manifestations\n  Another story here. If it something like this happening, always be awake. Most of the people are nervous, the police are nervous. a single isolated happening can be the trigger for anything. Same tactics, don't be at their patch, take your phots, follow them, by side, in their front, at their backs, whatever. But here comes another tip: Always be aware of any surrounds, be aware of backpacks, stay awake from the police formation (lines of motor and cars, lines of cops well gauged). People are stressed, don't discuss, only snap, be quiet and try to not influence in nothing, that's their fight, not yours! remember that, you're the photographer, not exactly the person in the front line, and off course, as I mentioned, any isolated happening can be a trigger...\n\nd)riots\n   Are you here? are you happy? if yes, I have bad news for you, because people may get hurt, hope it isn't you. Control your adrenaline to not f*ck up. As soon some rioter swing full force on the police, police are going to use everything they have to control people and take them out of the streets, so, rubber bullets, bombs, stun grenades, water, is all normal stuff you'll have to deal. Rioters too, any glass bottle, Molotovs are going to be throwing at the police. And note that, you're not their friends, you're not the police friends, not the rioter friends. From now on you are on your own, and you do you. \n Keep yourself safe, and try to avoid risk areas where the confrontation is happening. \n thinking about shooting riots, I have to say something even more sad, helmets makes you easy targets. Be aware about what you're using! helmets saying you're 'PRESS' can be a target for both police and rioters, they aren't respecting you because of it, you're their enemies now because they don't know if they can trust you or not. what's a shame and very sad. \n\nso now we come to our dos and don'ts:\n1)be ready and don't be afraid to get closer to your subject;\n2) front shots are always better than back shots (of course some back shots can give you more information about who's protesting)\n3) if police is there, they can be your safety, but do not stay too close, some bottles threw at the police can hit you\n4) if you feel safe at the protesters side remember you be hit by stun grenades, debris and rubber bullets\n5) your gear must be resistant, and of course weather sealed at least, it may not work if a rubber bullet hit it, but you've tried\n6) distance can be your enemy and also your ally, but think where you're safer at the moment   \n7) when shit happens, the only friends you'll have are the other photogs, stick with them, they're on the same boat\n8) zoom or fixed lens its on your own, both will give you good results, its now on your view of the subject \n9) don't be afraid. \n10) if you want to show the truth, don't pick sides\n\nI'm on the street, doing this kind of stuff since 2016 as a photographer.

I\u2019ll start by focusing on the different notions that you have to know to understand the settings and the features of a camera. This will help you decide which camera might be the one for you, and how to use it.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not a specialist, but I have done a lot of research to get my stuff, and I\u2019ve made mistakes by the past, so I\u2019m here to help you guys avoid those.\n\n    Camera gear vocabulary\n\n* DSLR: This term is used to point at the bulky black camera you usually see. Those are the most commons I would say, and you usually can detect them by the distinct sounds they make when taking a picture. We can also call a camera, a body.\n \n* Mirrorless: A camera is considered mirrorless when it got \u2026 no mirror. This is the thing that makes the sound and take the picture in a DSLR. In a mirrorless system, everything is dealt with electronics. They are smaller in general, feel less tough, but image quality wise, no major difference with DSLRs.\n \n* Full Frame: Regardless of body type, a camera is also distinguished by its sensor. The full frame type got the biggest sensor for the SLR fragment. Full frame sensors are usually seen in high end cameras.\n \n* APS-C: This kind of camera got a smaller sensor than a full frame one. A coefficient is usually used to get the full frame equivalent (x1.6 for Canon and x1.5 for Nikon and Sony, meaning a full frame sensor is 1.6 bigger than the Canon APS-C one). Most of entry level and mid-level cameras are using APS-C sensors. The kind of sensors will have mainly impacts on two things:\n \n * Light: there will be more luminosity gathered in a full frame camera. More light = better picture. For instance, a lens that has a f-stop of f/2.8, will have an equivalent of f/4 on an APS-C body. (2.8 * 1.6 = 4.5). Using the same lens will have different results depending on the camera used, solely based on sensor size.\n * Range: at the same distance, when looking at something, the aps-c user will get a tighten view. It means, that if the full frame user wants to get the view of the APS-C user, he\u2019s gonna have to move forward quite a bit. This is why people are reffering to different range on APS-C sometimes, for instance, a 70-200mm lens is gonna have an equivalent of 112-320mm for APS-C user. However, all the lenses range are based on full frame, even the ones only compatible for APS-C.\n\n* MFT: For micro four third, or 4/3, is another type of sensor which is twice smaller than one of a full frame, so the crop factor (ratio) is x2. It\u2019s a sensor usually seen in mirrorless cameras. I will not talk much about those because they are lacking in low light which is needed for K-Pop in general.\n \n* kitLens: This white thing on the picture, is a lens. This is what you need to attach to the body so it can capture photos. The quality of a photo will depend on the lens first, then on the camera. This is why, if you have to invest in one thing, it\u2019s the lens.\n\n* Focal lenght: This is the range of a lens basically. The higher the number, the closer you can look at something without moving. As a point of comparison, the human eye got a range of around 42mm.\n\n* Zoom lens: When a lens got a variety of focal lenght, it\u2019s a zoom lens, it means that it can go from one range to another.\n \n* Prime lens: Or fixed range, is to determine a lens that can\u2019t change its range \u2026 There are pros and cons to use either prime or zoom tho \u2026 I would recommend zoom because of versatility.\n \n* Aperture: It\u2019s the opening inside a lens that let the light go through. A big aperture (or wide to be precise) will let through more light. The aperture can also be called f-stop, and is mentionned on the lens by \u201cf/xx\u201d, xx being a number. You can have lenses with fixed aperture (ex: f/2.8) or variable aperture (ex: f/3.5-5.6). The lower the number, the bigger the aperture. A wide aperture lens tend to be more expensive as light is a very important feature in photography.\n \n* Image stabilization: This is a feature on lens (and on mirrorless bodies) that appease the natural shake of your hands when taking pictures, this is very interesting feature, because if you don\u2019t have it, you are gonna have to increase the shutter speed to compensate, so less light.\n\n* Shutter count: This is the number of shots a camera can take before being subject to failure, it\u2019s some kind of approximate lifespan. Most DSLRs got between 100 000 and 150 000. It doesn\u2019t mean that it gonna stop working once this number is reached, just that it\u2019s most likely to fail than a new one. If you are buying used gear, you have to check for this. (high shutter count = lower price)\n\n* Viewfinder: It\u2019s where you put your eye to see through the lens. You also have a diopter close to it, that you can adjust to see more clearly. (so people with glasses can shoot without them), since the diopter will simulate the correction of the glasses.\n \n* Liveview: There is a button dedicated to activate that, it\u2019s so you can view through the lens on the back screen of the camera instead of the viewfinder. Certain features of your camera will change when it\u2019s in liveview (for instance, the Canon 1DX Mark II got 16fps in liveview compared to the usual 14fps).\n \n\n         Camera settings vocabulary\n\n* ISO: This is the light sensitivity. When you go up, the image get brighter, but noise increase as well. So, it\u2019s about finding the compromise. We call base ISO, the lowest your camera can go, in a lot of photo dslr, it\u2019s 100.\n \n* White balance: It\u2019s the colors of the photo, expressed with numbers. Go toward 0 and the photo get colder, more blue-ish, go toward 9999, and the photo get warmer, more reddish. It\u2019s a camera settings that you shouldn\u2019t bother too much about, it can easily be changed afterward in post process.\n \n* Shutter speed: It\u2019s the time the sensor of the camera stays open to capture the light. The longer it stays, the more light it captures, but since it doesn\u2019t stop time \u2026 if things move (enough) during the trigger, things can get blurry. So, the settings have to be different depending on what the subject is doing. Dance performance ? It has to be faster, so you can freeze the moment like this. You can see that the hair is not blurry, so the speed was appropriate. However, in this picture, Chaeyeon wasn\u2019t moving fast enough so it\u2019s ok, but Heehyeon\u2019s hand was faster, so it appears blurry. To avoid confusion, 1\u2032 is one second, 1/30 is one thirthyth of a second, and 1/400 is one four hundredth of a second,so 1/30 is longer than 1/400.\n \n* RAW: Like the name suggest, this is the pure file without any kind of alteration. A raw file will have a lot of information saved within it, so it will be easier to process later on. However, because of all the data, a raw file is heavier. I suggest you to capture Raw in any case.\n \n* Focus: It\u2019s pretty self explanatory, the focus is when you target an element so that your camera know what to shoot, and your target appears sharp. For instance, in this picture, I focused on Yoohyeon so she appears more sharp than Sua, who is more blurry. It\u2019s very important to hit your focus right, otherwise, it will ruin your pictures. In general, put your target in the middle of the screen, with experience, you can direct the focus with precision.\n \n* Focus mode: In a camera, you have different mode to what you want to capture, moving subject or still subject ? Either way, I would suggest you to choose the moving subject focus mode, called AI Servo on Canon and AF-C on Nikon (I don\u2019t know about others).\n \n* Framerate: or FPS is the frame per seconds in which you record a video. 30FPS, 60FPS, 120FPS, etc. This will impact the smoothness of a video. You need at least 24FPS so the eye can track and understand motions, lower and it will look ugly as fuck. 60FPS is a sweet spot for dance performance. Here is a comparison, the 60FPS of God dancing, and the not-60FPS video of God dancing, so yeah, the 60FPS looks smoother but not all cameras can do that.\n \n* For photos, the FPS refers to the speed you can take pictures in a chain (also called FPS continuous shooting), for instance, this dude is showing the speed of his camera. As a reference the Canon 80D got 7fps which is good.\n \n* Buffer size: This is the numbers of photos you can take before your camera slow down. (for Sony, they stopped entirely, waiting) The photos have to write themselves on the storage, and this take some times, thus this buffer size notion. It depends on the speed of your camera and the memory card used. You can shoot longer depending on the file chosen (since jpeg file weight less). Here is an example of a guy filling the buffer size on his 80D. Something along 10/15 for Raw is quite standard, higher end cameras can shoot longer.\n \n* Bitrate: This is a number that defines the flow of data when recording a video. The higher the number, the higher the data, consider this data as details. So, if the video has a high bitrate like 100 MBps (megabytes per second), the video will be more detailled, better quality. High bitrate = high storage needed.\n\n\n           Photo vocabulary\n\n* Noise: When a picture looks grainy, it\u2019s noise\u2026 This thing appears when it\u2019s lacking light in general. Example.\n \n* Sharp: We call a picture sharp when there is no blur, when we can see all details, and everything is pretty and shit. Sharp = clear. Here is a sharp photo of God.\n \n* Soft: When it\u2019s not sharp, it\u2019s soft. It\u2019s usually a bit blurry, it doesn\u2019t mean that the photo is bad but sometimes, softness can\u2019t be avoided because of lens, environment, etc. Here is an example. Soyeon is in focus (more or less\u2026), however, it\u2019s not sharp because of gear and light. Usually, when you want to reduce noise, you introduce softness, it\u2019s about a compromise, how much softness and noise you want in your picture.\n \n* Bokeh: It\u2019s the background blurr, how isolate is your subject from the background. Example. You can see that Qri is sharp but we can\u2019t distinguish the leaves behind her. The bokeh, also related to the notion of depth of field, is affected by the focal lenght, and the aperture.\n\n* Megapixels: This is the resolution of a camera. For instance, 24 megapixels (mpx) is 6000\u00d74000 resolution on a computer. (6000*4000=24M). Usually, something around 20 is more than enough to get good looking pictures. Having higher will allow you to crop better tho, but that comes to a price.\n\n\n        **[TUTORIAL] CAMERA GEARING GUIDE FOR K-POP \u2013 GEAR ADVICES AND RECOMMENDATIONS (PART 2/3)**\n\nIf you are willing to shoot photos or videos of your idols and invest in an appropriate camera gear, this guide will help you decide.\n\nFirst thing is to decide the budget you want to use, then the type of things you want to do (photo, video or both ?). Note: camera gear is really expensive.\n\nIf you want to get pics like the usual fansites, be prepared to invest quite a lot. You often see those Canon white lens ? Well, it costs that much. However, do you need this to get quality photos or videos ? Well, not necessarily, there are alternatives.\n\nI will mostly focus on full frame and APS-C cameras, as MFT and point and shoot cameras are not perfectly suited for K-Pop as you usually need range and low light capabilities, that those two are lacking.\n\nFirst of all, the brand you are choosing, I\u2019m gonna stick to three, as I consider them to be the most suitable for what we shoot.\n\n* Canon:\n * Decent camera bodies, with decent performance in photos and videos\n * Good variety of lenses\n * the most used in general, so easier to get used stuff at good price\n* Nikon:\n * Better camera bodies than Canon, better value at least\n * Lenses are not as good as the Canon counterpart in general\n * Bad for videos because of the focus\n* Sony:\n * recent mirrorless cameras has been really good, for both photos and videos\n * low variety of lens, you can\u2019t go over 200mm easily\n * Lenses are really expensive, but camera bodies are ok\n\nThose are the brands for cameras, they also make their own lenses (native lens), but there are also other brands that can make lenses for those systems, they are called third parties manufacturers. You mostly have to care about Sigma and Tamron as for now.\n\n    General tips\n\n* Used cameras: you have to look for the shutter count.  The higher the shutter count, the lower the price, obviously, but you shouldn\u2019t buy a camera that has a too high count. Under 30 000 would be pretty decent while providing a good discount on the price. If it\u2019s too high, you might have to include the cost of renewing the shutter, but it\u2019s another step and hassle. (cost varies depending on cameras)\n \n* Warranty: we called grey market, any product coming from export (usually asia). Those products are cheaper (even brand new), but if something happens, it\u2019s gonna be harder for you to claim warranty. I would suggest to buy grey market lens but stick to classic market bodies (buy the camera in an approved retailer in your country for instance). Well, the product is the same, so it\u2019s up to you, is the price gap worth it ? Personally, all my gear is grey market.\n \n* Kit lenses: in general, avoid them, I\u2019m talking about the 18-55mm you usually get with your cameras. This lens is gonna be useless for K-pop and the quality is usually bad. I would suggest you to buy a prime lens instead (50mm f/1.8 is a good one, regardless of cameras as each brand got their own affordable option). For K-pop uses, 18-55mm is not enough range in general anyway so you don\u2019t need it. Here is a photo I took using my very first set-up with a 18-55mm. (at 55mm range), and here is the zoomed version. On another hand, here is a picture I took using a Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM on a crop sensor, you can see that I\u2019m lacking a bit of range, but the quality is way better. My advise: buy a 70-200mm instead and get yourself a 35mm or 50mm for wider shoot. (as those primes are usually between 100/200\u20ac so quite affordable.)\n \n* Used lens: a lot of lenses, especially the professional ones are built like tanks so they have quite a long lifespan so it\u2019s quite easy to buy a used lens. However, what you have to check is the state of the glass, is it ok ? Check for fungus  and any defect possible, look from one end and the other, is there dust inside ? Also, try the lens if you can, especially the focus system as it can go off if there is an issue inside.\n* \nAccronyms:\n\n* Image stabilization: it got different names depending on manufacturers:\n * Canon: IS = Image stabilization\n * Nikon: VR = Vibration reduction\n * Sony: OSS = Optical steady shot\n * Sigma: OS = Optical stabilization\n * Tamron: VC = Vibration control\n* Lens format: Full frame and APS-C designed lenses got their names as well:\n * Canon: EF for full frame and EF-S for APS-C\n * Nikon: FX for full frame and DX for APS-C\n * Sony: FE for full frame and E for APS-C\n* Quality indicator: for expensive shits\n * Canon: got an \u201cL\u201d after the aperture to indicate professional oriented lens,\n * Sony: G Master serie\n * Tamron: SP for Super Performance\n * Sigma: A = art, S = sport, C = contempory ; it\u2019s the uses for which the lens was designed for\n * Nikon: I have no fucking idea, they don\u2019t have one I think\nThey are also other accronyms but they are less important I would say.\n\n            What to buy beside camera+lens ?\n\n* Batteries: If you are using a DSLR camera, I would suggest you to buy at least one additionnal battery, because if you are shooting non stop during a fansign, you will end low on battery after 2 hours (talking from experience), so just in case, have some safety measure. Also, get official batteries, the third batteries are cheaper but their lifespan is way shorter. When shooting mirrorless, you might need more because the batteries don\u2019t usually last as long as the DSLR counterparts.\n \n* Battery grip: It\u2019s an accessory that you put at the bottom of you camera that brings 2 things. One, is a slot for another battery, your camera will have 2 batteries in it, so you don\u2019t have to change it during a session. Two, is the ease to shoot vertical photos since they are additional commands on a battery grip. This is why for Dreamcatcher London, all my photos are horizontal, but for Dreamcatcher Amsterdam, I have some vertical shots as I have the grip with me. I would also suggest to get official battery grip since it\u2019s linked to the camera system, but it\u2019s expensive as fuck for what it is, it\u2019s up to you eventually. You can still shoot vertically, it\u2019s just not as convenient.\n \n* Memory cards: depending on your cameras, you might need to use SD cards (most frequent nowadays), Cfast cards or XQD. Check that your computer can read those cards, would be sad if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t forget to get an adapter then. For your memory card, you need something that can handle the storage needed, and the speed. For a lot of cameras, the SD card you want needs to have a UHS-I written on it (or U1), it\u2019s a speed norm that quite some cameras have right now. UHS-II is for high-end cameras, so just ignore as it\u2019s not that common anyway. If you\u2019re planning on shooting non-stop during an event, the memory card is gonna have to be handle more, as a reference, for a fansign of 2 hours, with a Canon 80D (which have a good speed and buffer), I have almost 6000 photos for 150GO. However, this is me and I\u2019m an insane shooter, spamming that fucking button. I would recommend 2 64GO cards or a single 128GO card, this is a good start and should be able to handle all your needs.\n \n* Flashes: Clearly not needed in almost all situations, but it might come handy in some rare situations, like airport or exterior night shooting. Do not use them during dance performance, and fansigns, it\u2019s bad etiquette and you\u2019ll probably be asked to get it off or worse, be kicked. Don\u2019t need to buy an official flash (Canon, Nikon, Sony) as they are too expensive for the uses we have, instead, get a third party one that can be as good, like any Yongnuo one. Flash should be the least of your worry anyway. An example for what flash can bring: Handong after the Amsterdam concert.\n \n* Tripod/monopod: A tripod is a stand for your camera to rest, this is an extremly convenient item and I suggest you to buy one if you can, they are especially useful in fansigns. The tripod will allow you to reduce the shake since you don\u2019t have to carry your camera anymore, and it\u2019s more \u2026 energy friendly, holding a dslr for hours is tiring, believe me. A monopod has the same purpose but it\u2019s on one leg instead, so, less stable as you can\u2019t just leave the camera there, but you\u2019re more mobile so if you have to move, it\u2019s good.\n\n        What do we need for K-Pop ?\n\nMost of K-Pop events can be either outdoor or indoor, so you should stick to the worse scenarios to base your purchase on, which is : indoor and low light. So you need something that can be used in this situation.\n\n* Aperture: f/2.8 is a good aperture in low light without an inconvenient depth of field, so this should be your go to aperture. f/1.8 or f/2 are also good options but those lenses are not as common beside the prime.\n \n* Focal lenght: 70-200mm should be your go-to lens, it\u2019s an extremly versatile focal lenght and should cover a great part of your needs. In very rare situation, where you are really close, a 35mm prime should be great to compensate or a standard zoom (24-70mm). This applies for APS-C as well, but you can find  yourself a bit tight by 70 (as it\u2019s about 110mm full frame equivalent), so a wider lens might be needed, although, in most cases, it\u2019s ok. For the Kard showcase, I was at second line, so very close and the 70-200mm on my crop sensor felt a bit tight sometimes, I couldn\u2019t get a full body shot of Somin when she was in front for instance.\n \n* Extra focal lenght: In some situations, 200mm may not be enough, for instance if your seat is far in a fansign, or during a dance performance. There are two options:\n \n * Extender: It\u2019s something you put between the camera and the lens, they usually increase the range by 1.4 or 2. However, there will be a degradation of the image quality, and if you are using a 1.4 extender, you will lose one stop of ligt (f/2.8 to f/4, f/4 to f/5.6, etc.). The focus speed will also be slower.\n * Another lens\u2026 Sigma 150-600mm , Nikon 200-500mm, Tamron 150-600mm should be the main ones unless you have thousands of euros, then go for prime telefoto lens, but it\u2019s above my knowledge (considering that a lens can go over 6000\u20ac so \u2026).\n\n* ISO performance: You are gonna need a camera that can get a maximum ISO of at least 6400, because in dark environment (concert room for instance), you\u2019re gonna reach that maximum\u2026\n \n* Video: Something that can film 1080p at 60FPS is a sweet spot, most cameras can do 1080p 30fps so it should be fine, but if you\u2019re aiming to get fancams, over photos, 60fps is needed. Unless you go 4k 30fps, but getting into 4K is more expensive.\n\n        Camera Bodies recommendations\n\nI will focus most likely on APS-C and full frame bodies, and all the price will be new and grey market, and without the kit lens. So you\u2019re gonna have to adjust the price for your country if don\u2019t want grey market (add something like 20/25%). Also, you are gonna have to do your own research, i\u2019m just leading you on a path, as they are more to just what I show there.\n\n \n\n\nCanon 60D :\n270\u20ac\nAPS-C / 18mpx / 5.3fps / 1080p 30fps / 9 focus points\n\nCanon 750D:\n430\u20ac\nAPS-C / 24mpx / 5fps / 1080p 30fps / 19 focus points\n\nCanon 800D:\n560\u20ac\nAPS-C / 24mpx / 6fps / 1080p 60fps / 45 focus points / dual pixel\n\nCanon 6D: \n830\u20ac\nFull frame / 20mpx / 4.5fps / 1080p 30fps / 9 focus points\n\nCanon 80D:\n690\u20ac\nAPS-C / 24mpx / 7fps / 1080p 60 fps / 45 focus points / dual pixel\n\nCanon 7D Mark II:\n950\u20ac\nAPS-C / 20mpx / 10fps / 1080p 60fps / 69 focus points / dual pixel\n\nCanon 6D Mark II :\n1300\u20ac\nFull frame / 26mpx / 6.5fps / 1080p 60fps / 45 focus points / dual pixel\n\nCanon 5D Mark IV:\n2400\u20ac\nFull frame / 30mpx / 7fps / 4k 30fps (cropped) / 61 focus points / dual pixel\n\nCanon 1DX Mark II:\n4300\u20ac\nFull frame / 20mpx / 14fps / 4k 60fps / 61 focus points\n \n\n\n\nNikon D3400:\n320\u20ac\nAPS-C / 24mpx / 5fps / 1080p 60fps / 11 focus points\n\nNikon D5600:\n460\u20ac\nAPS-C / 24mpx / 5fps / 1080p 60fps / 39 focus points\n\nNikon D610: \n890\u20ac\nFull frame / 24mpx / 6fps / 1080p 30fps / 39 focus points\n\nNikon D750:\n1200\u20ac\nFull frame / 24mpx / 6.5fps / 1080p 60fps / 51 focus points\n\nNikon D500:\n1350\u20ac\nAPS-C / 21mpx / 10fps / 4k 30fps (cropped) / 153 focus points\n\nNikon D810:\n1700\u20ac\nFull frame / 36mpx / 5fps / 1080p 60fps / 51 focus points\n\nNikon D850:\n2900\u20ac\nFull frame / 45mpx / 7fps and 9fps with battery grip / 4k 30fps / 153 focus points\n\n\nSony A7 III:\n2200\u20ac \u2013 retail price, not grey market as it\u2019s a very recent camera\nFull frame / 24mpx / 10fps / 4k 30fps / 693 focus points\n\nSony A7R III:\n2800\u20ac\nFull frame / 42mpx / 10fps / 4k 30fps / 399 focus points\n\nSony A9:\n3500\u20ac\nFull frame / 24mpx / 20fps / 4k 30fps / 693 focus points\n\n    Lenses recommendations\n\nIn general, a full frame lens will work on an APS-C body, (although you won\u2019t get the same range because of the crop factor), but the other way around won\u2019t work well. If it does, you will have some serious quality drop so, is it worth it ?\n\nThe lenses I recommend, all prices will be new, and grey market, so you might notice some differences, and buying a lens used isn\u2019t an issue at all: (sorted from cheaper to out of mind)\n\n* Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM:\n * 150\u20ac (Only get the STM version, the previous ones are dipshit)\n * insane value for the buck and very good range overall\n * only compatible with Canon APS-C cameras\n \n* Tamron SP 70-300 f/4-5.6 Di VC USD: \n * 260\u20ac\n * Good range and value for its price\n * In either Canon, Nikon or Sony version (+30\u20ac)\n\n* Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6 ED VR:\n * 230\u20ac\n * Good range and value, although more expensive than the Canon counterpart\n * Only for Nikon APS-C\n\n* Tamron 100-400mm f/4.5-6.3 Di VC USD: \n * 570\u20ac\n * Good range overall, with decent quality and value\n * it\u2019s lacking indoor because of the aperture but at this price point, not much possible at this range\n\n* Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 Di VC USD (also called G1 or A009): \n * 680\u20ac (Do not get the macro version, it\u2019s utter bullshit)\n * good value, good performance\n * compatible with either Canon, Nikon or Sony\n\n* Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM C:\n * 700\u20ac\n * Long telefoto lens, very good value for the range it can reach\n * It shouldn\u2019t be used for under 300mm, you should just get a 70-200mm instead\n * in either Canon or Nikon mount\n\n* Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 (A025):\n * 1000\u20ac\n * good value, performance is almost equal to the native lens\n * in either Canon or Nikon edition\n\n* Nikon 200-500 f/5.6E ED VR:\n * 1000\u20ac\n * Good value, with good focus overall\n * fixed aperture, nice on a long range telefoto lens\n\n* Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM II:\n * 1400\u20ac\n * worse value than the tamron one, but better at long range and slightly faster focus speed\n * the classic white lens you see everywhere\n\n* Sony FE 70-200 f/4 GM OSS: \n * 1400\u20ac\n * The cheap alternative for Sony xD\n * Lens is good despite the f/4\n\n* Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6L IS USM II: \n * 1500\u20ac\n * good range, ok value, image quality is not as good as the 70-200 f/2.8 but compensate with the extra range\n * because of the aperture, it kinda sucks in low light, but it should do ok in fansigns and outdoor fanmeeting\n\n* Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 ED VR II: \n * 1700\u20ac\n * Nikon native lens for this range, all the previous version are obsolete compared to the tamron version\n * worse value than the tamron one for not an actual better option but if you want proprietaire option, it\u2019s this one\n\n* Canon EF 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6L IS USM:\n * 1700\u20ac\n * It\u2019s an extremly versatile lens, but at the cost of image quality, but at least, you won\u2019t need any other lens. It\u2019s still an L lens, so quality is enough in most situation.\n * The wide end is very so-so\n\n* Sony FE 70-200mm f/2.8 GM OSS:\n * 2000\u20ac\n * not much possibilities with Sony cameras, lens is excellent though\n\n* Sony FE 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 GM OSS: \n * 2200\u20ac\n * If you want to reach past 200mm, you don\u2019t have much choice with Sony\n\n* Sigma 120-300mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM:\n * 2800\u20ac\n * Really good range, especially at f/2.8\n * really heavy and expensive, and not as sharp as the 70-200mm but image quality is still nice\n * Canon or Nikon option\n\n* Sidenote: For Sony bodies, you can use a converter to get Canon mount lenses on the Sony bodies, you don\u2019t lose much on image quality, but the issue is focus speed as it\u2019s not as reliable, also, it can varies quite a bit from a lens to another. Look for Metabones speedboosters and Sigma converter.\n\n        Tripod recommendations\n\nAnything that that suit all the below characteristic :\n\n* it can reach your eye level while being seated\n* it can withstand twice the weight of your heavier camera set up\n* is aluminium (because cheaper)\n* you shouldn\u2019t go over 150\u20ac, and a lot of good options around 100\u20ac\n\nThe manfrotto befree is quite popular, really light, good enough height, and can support 4KG, which is enough for a 70-200mm set up.\n\nFor anything standing, I would suggest a monopod, some tripod can have some leg converted as a monopod, so, why not. Also, you can just stick to a monopod, instead of a tripod, it\u2019s fine, but I personally like having the option to just leave the camera there. You can also look up for video monopod that can stand on their own but they are quite expensive for the good ones.\n\n    **[TUTORIAL] CAMERA GEARING GUIDE FOR K-POP \u2013 SETTINGS, SHOOTING, AND POST PROCESS (PART 3/3)**\n\nThe last part of the camera tutorials will be focused on settings and to use your cameras for what we need.\n\nFirst of all, go and set the camera on M mode, which is the manual mode.\n\n    Camera settings\n\n* White balance: You should just put it on auto. This is one less thing to worry about, as it can change from a scene to another quite frequently, and since it can be easily corrected in post process, it\u2019s ok.\n \n* ISO: In most cases, you should put it on auto as well, however, you can still tune it a bit. You can set a maximum ISO for the auto mode to reach, the max you set is gonna depend on situation. For the dreamcatcher concert, I set it at 8000 max in Amsterdam, because I got some shots at 10 000 in London, and it was too much. Since in a dance performance, the lights are gonna change a lot, auto iso is necessary. For more calm scene, like, in a fanmeeting or fansign, you can fix the ISO yourself for a better control of the image. However, in a fansign, from one member to another, the light can be different so keep that in mind.\n \n* Exposure composition: it\u2019s the black and white +/- symbol combo, in general, it\u2019s best to have a slightly underexposed picture, so you can go to -0.3 to -1, don\u2019t go too much. Letting it at 0 is also fine, this is not a decisive factor in image quality anyway.\n \n* Shutter Speed: You need something fast enough to freeze the moments (no blurr), and something slow enough to let enough light and limit noise. What I use right now:\n \n * 1/125 for posing idols, where the subject will freeze himself for a shot time\n * 1/200 and 1/250 for talking and reaction capture, slow paced stuff in general\n * 1/400 and 1/640 for dance performance, depending on dance, you can also change it, but for Dreamcatcher for instance, I find those two shutter speeds to be in a sweet spot. The hair are sometimes a bit soft on 1/400, this is why I\u2019m also using 1/640 depending on songs.\n\n* Aperture: Always go to the lowest value possible, it\u2019s especially true with variable aperture lens, as it change depending on the range. It can happen to forget to put it back to the lowest. One exception is that you have a really fast lens (below f/1.8) and you are close enough to the subject, you might want to tune it a bit. But considering that f/2.8 is quite the standard, it shouldn\u2019t happen much.\n \n* File: Shoot Raw in priority, and if you are lacking storage \u2026 yeah, go jpg. If you have two cards slot, one good option is to shoot Raw on main card and jpeg on second card as you have a back up just in case the main card die. However, this will add a strain on the camera so it will be slower (buffer size), so it\u2019s up to you. I personnaly set my second card on overload option as I want to keep my momentum while shooting.\n \n* Focus mode: depending on the camera, try to get the focus mode dedicated to moving subject, this will help you track the subject across your screen more accurately. Also, choose the largest possible area (highest numer of cross focus points) to focus. In mirrorless, you also have face detect and eye detect, those are good options in general. You might want to try the settings yourself to see what suits you the most.\n\n* Button configuration: In general, to get a photo on a fresh camera, you push the trigger halfway, it focuses, then, you fully push and it shoot. What I find more convenient tho is to configure one button to focus, and let the trigger to shoot pictures, regardless of the focus. You have to choose a conveniently placed button (under the thumb ideally), and that is not important in general, and configure it to AF-ON (autofocus on). On my Nikon, it\u2019s the AE-L button that I decided to switch off. Note: you also have to configure it on the battery grip if you have one and the camera settings propose this option.\n \n* Video settings: I would suggest to shoot at least at 1080p 60fps, but if you can, shoot 4K, even if it\u2019s 30fps. When shooting video, you can change the shutter speed to adapt to the record.\n \n * 25fps = 1/50 / 50fps = 1/100\n * 30fps = 1/60 / 60fps = 1/120\n* Then, the bitrate, if your memory card can handle it, choose the higher bitrate everytime. This will put a strain on your memory card, and the post process since the video will weight more, but better have good quality from the start than regretting it later.\n \n* Shooting mode: You can have different modes: single shot, quiet single shot,  continuous high speed, continious low speed, continuous quiet, delay, bulb. It can be a bi", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/8ci67i/proofread_my_tutorials/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "spot", "selectorShort": "spot", "MarkedSent": "proofread my tutorials /!/ hey guys,\n\ni wrote some tutorials for a very specific community, as it may needs some help on getting somehow into photography, even for a short period. this is something that would have helped me when i started this is why i've done it. so, if you can help me correct any kind of issues, or add/delete anything, please do. this is actually longer than i expected so ... thanks if you read it, even a bit.\n\nsome context clarification, this is a [fansign](https://youtu.be/80alcdw3fom?t=1m19s), this is a [fanmeeting](https://youtu.be/25ioux_whlg?t=5s), and well, dance performance and concert are pretty self explanatory.\n\n_____\n\n    **[tutorial] camera gearing guide for k-pop \u2013 basic notions before buying (part 1/3)**\n\nthis is the first part of different tutorials on camera gearing for k-pop related uses. i\u2019ll start by focusing on the different notions that you have to know to understand the settings and the features of a camera. this will help you decide which camera might be the one for you, and how to use it.\n\ndisclaimer: i\u2019m not a specialist, but i have done a lot of research to get my stuff, and i\u2019ve made mistakes by the past, so i\u2019m here to help you guys avoid those.\n\n    camera gear vocabulary\n\n* dslr: this term is used to point at the bulky black camera you usually see. those are the most commons i would say, and you usually can detect them by the distinct sounds they make when taking a picture. we can also call a camera, a body.\n \n* mirrorless: a camera is considered mirrorless when it got \u2026 no mirror. this is the thing that makes the sound and take the picture in a dslr. in a mirrorless system, everything is dealt with electronics. they are smaller in general, feel less tough, but image quality wise, no major difference with dslrs.\n \n* full frame: regardless of body type, a camera is also distinguished by its sensor. the full frame type got the biggest sensor for the slr fragment. full frame sensors are usually seen in high end cameras.\n \n* aps-c: this kind of camera got a smaller sensor than a full frame one. a coefficient is usually used to get the full frame equivalent (x1.6 for canon and x1.5 for nikon and sony, meaning a full frame sensor is 1.6 bigger than the canon aps-c one). most of entry level and mid-level cameras are using aps-c sensors. the kind of sensors will have mainly impacts on two things:\n \n * light: there will be more luminosity gathered in a full frame camera. more light = better picture. for instance, a lens that has a f-stop of f/2.8, will have an equivalent of f/4 on an aps-c body. (2.8 * 1.6 = 4.5). using the same lens will have different results depending on the camera used, solely based on sensor size.\n * range: at the same distance, when looking at something, the aps-c user will get a tighten view. it means, that if the full frame user wants to get the view of the aps-c user, he\u2019s gonna have to move forward quite a bit. this is why people are reffering to different range on aps-c sometimes, for instance, a 70-200mm lens is gonna have an equivalent of 112-320mm for aps-c user. however, all the lenses range are based on full frame, even the ones only compatible for aps-c.\n\n* mft: for micro four third, or 4/3, is another type of sensor which is twice smaller than one of a full frame, so the crop factor (ratio) is x2. it\u2019s a sensor usually seen in mirrorless cameras. i will not talk much about those because they are lacking in low light which is needed for k-pop in general.\n \n* kitlens: this white thing on the picture, is a lens. this is what you need to attach to the body so it can capture photos. the quality of a photo will depend on the lens first, then on the camera. this is why, if you have to invest in one thing, it\u2019s the lens.\n\n* focal lenght: this is the range of a lens basically. the higher the number, the closer you can look at something without moving. as a point of comparison, the human eye got a range of around 42mm.\n\n* zoom lens: when a lens got a variety of focal lenght, it\u2019s a zoom lens, it means that it can go from one range to another.\n \n* prime lens: or fixed range, is to determine a lens that can\u2019t change its range \u2026 there are pros and cons to use either prime or zoom tho \u2026 i would recommend zoom because of versatility.\n \n* aperture: it\u2019s the opening inside a lens that let the light go through. a big aperture (or wide to be precise) will let through more light. the aperture can also be called f-stop, and is mentionned on the lens by \u201cf/xx\u201d, xx being a number. you can have lenses with fixed aperture (ex: f/2.8) or variable aperture (ex: f/3.5-5.6). the lower the number, the bigger the aperture. a wide aperture lens tend to be more expensive as light is a very important feature in photography.\n \n* image stabilization: this is a feature on lens (and on mirrorless bodies) that appease the natural shake of your hands when taking pictures, this is very interesting feature, because if you don\u2019t have it, you are gonna have to increase the shutter speed to compensate, so less light.\n\n* shutter count: this is the number of shots a camera can take before being subject to failure, it\u2019s some kind of approximate lifespan. most dslrs got between 100 000 and 150 000. it doesn\u2019t mean that it gonna stop working once this number is reached, just that it\u2019s most likely to fail than a new one. if you are buying used gear, you have to check for this. (high shutter count = lower price)\n\n* viewfinder: it\u2019s where you put your eye to see through the lens. you also have a diopter close to it, that you can adjust to see more clearly. (so people with glasses can shoot without them), since the diopter will simulate the correction of the glasses.\n \n* liveview: there is a button dedicated to activate that, it\u2019s so you can view through the lens on the back screen of the camera instead of the viewfinder. certain features of your camera will change when it\u2019s in liveview (for instance, the canon 1dx mark ii got 16fps in liveview compared to the usual 14fps).\n \n\n         camera settings vocabulary\n\n* iso: this is the light sensitivity. when you go up, the image get brighter, but noise increase as well. so, it\u2019s about finding the compromise. we call base iso, the lowest your camera can go, in a lot of photo dslr, it\u2019s 100.\n \n* white balance: it\u2019s the colors of the photo, expressed with numbers. go toward 0 and the photo get colder, more blue-ish, go toward 9999, and the photo get warmer, more reddish. it\u2019s a camera settings that you shouldn\u2019t bother too much about, it can easily be changed afterward in post process.\n \n* shutter speed: it\u2019s the time the sensor of the camera stays open to capture the light. the longer it stays, the more light it captures, but since it doesn\u2019t stop time \u2026 if things move (enough) during the trigger, things can get blurry. so, the settings have to be different depending on what the subject is doing. dance performance ? it has to be faster, so you can freeze the moment like this. you can see that the hair is not blurry, so the speed was appropriate. however, in this picture, chaeyeon wasn\u2019t moving fast enough so it\u2019s ok, but heehyeon\u2019s hand was faster, so it appears blurry. to avoid confusion, 1\u2032 is one second, 1/30 is one thirthyth of a second, and 1/400 is one four hundredth of a second,so 1/30 is longer than 1/400.\n \n* raw: like the name suggest, this is the pure file without any kind of alteration. a raw file will have a lot of information saved within it, so it will be easier to process later on. however, because of all the data, a raw file is heavier. i suggest you to capture raw in any case.\n \n* focus: it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, the focus is when you target an element so that your camera know what to shoot, and your target appears sharp. for instance, in this picture, i focused on yoohyeon so she appears more sharp than sua, who is more blurry. it\u2019s very important to hit your focus right, otherwise, it will ruin your pictures. in general, put your target in the middle of the screen, with experience, you can direct the focus with precision.\n \n* focus mode: in a camera, you have different mode to what you want to capture, moving subject or still subject ? either way, i would suggest you to choose the moving subject focus mode, called ai servo on canon and af-c on nikon (i don\u2019t know about others).\n \n* framerate: or fps is the frame per seconds in which you record a video. 30fps, 60fps, 120fps, etc. this will impact the smoothness of a video. you need at least 24fps so the eye can track and understand motions, lower and it will look ugly as fuck. 60fps is a sweet -----> spot !!!  for dance performance. here is a comparison, the 60fps of god dancing, and the not-60fps video of god dancing, so yeah, the 60fps looks smoother but not all cameras can do that.\n \n* for photos, the fps refers to the speed you can take pictures in a chain (also called fps continuous shooting), for instance, this dude is showing the speed of his camera. as a reference the canon 80d got 7fps which is good.\n \n* buffer size: this is the numbers of photos you can take before your camera slow down. (for sony, they stopped entirely, waiting) the photos have to write themselves on the storage, and this take some times, thus this buffer size notion. it depends on the speed of your camera and the memory card used. you can shoot longer depending on the file chosen (since jpeg file weight less). here is an example of a guy filling the buffer size on his 80d. something along 10/15 for raw is quite standard, higher end cameras can shoot longer.\n \n* bitrate: this is a number that defines the flow of data when recording a video. the higher the number, the higher the data, consider this data as details. so, if the video has a high bitrate like 100 mbps (megabytes per second), the video will be more detailled, better quality. high bitrate = high storage needed.\n\n\n           photo vocabulary\n\n* noise: when a picture looks grainy, it\u2019s noise\u2026 this thing appears when it\u2019s lacking light in general. example.\n \n* sharp: we call a picture sharp when there is no blur, when we can see all details, and everything is pretty and shit. sharp = clear. here is a sharp photo of god.\n \n* soft: when it\u2019s not sharp, it\u2019s soft. it\u2019s usually a bit blurry, it doesn\u2019t mean that the photo is bad but sometimes, softness can\u2019t be avoided because of lens, environment, etc. here is an example. soyeon is in focus (more or less\u2026), however, it\u2019s not sharp because of gear and light. usually, when you want to reduce noise, you introduce softness, it\u2019s about a compromise, how much softness and noise you want in your picture.\n \n* bokeh: it\u2019s the background blurr, how isolate is your subject from the background. example. you can see that qri is sharp but we can\u2019t distinguish the leaves behind her. the bokeh, also related to the notion of depth of field, is affected by the focal lenght, and the aperture.\n\n* megapixels: this is the resolution of a camera. for instance, 24 megapixels (mpx) is 6000\u00d74000 resolution on a computer. (6000*4000=24m). usually, something around 20 is more than enough to get good looking pictures. having higher will allow you to crop better tho, but that comes to a price.\n\n\n        **[tutorial] camera gearing guide for k-pop \u2013 gear advices and recommendations (part 2/3)**\n\nif you are willing to shoot photos or videos of your idols and invest in an appropriate camera gear, this guide will help you decide.\n\nfirst thing is to decide the budget you want to use, then the type of things you want to do (photo, video or both ?). note: camera gear is really expensive.\n\nif you want to get pics like the usual fansites, be prepared to invest quite a lot. you often see those canon white lens ? well, it costs that much. however, do you need this to get quality photos or videos ? well, not necessarily, there are alternatives.\n\ni will mostly focus on full frame and aps-c cameras, as mft and point and shoot cameras are not perfectly suited for k-pop as you usually need range and low light capabilities, that those two are lacking.\n\nfirst of all, the brand you are choosing, i\u2019m gonna stick to three, as i consider them to be the most suitable for what we shoot.\n\n* canon:\n * decent camera bodies, with decent performance in photos and videos\n * good variety of lenses\n * the most used in general, so easier to get used stuff at good price\n* nikon:\n * better camera bodies than canon, better value at least\n * lenses are not as good as the canon counterpart in general\n * bad for videos because of the focus\n* sony:\n * recent mirrorless cameras has been really good, for both photos and videos\n * low variety of lens, you can\u2019t go over 200mm easily\n * lenses are really expensive, but camera bodies are ok\n\nthose are the brands for cameras, they also make their own lenses (native lens), but there are also other brands that can make lenses for those systems, they are called third parties manufacturers. you mostly have to care about sigma and tamron as for now.\n\n    general tips\n\n* used cameras: you have to look for the shutter count.  the higher the shutter count, the lower the price, obviously, but you shouldn\u2019t buy a camera that has a too high count. under 30 000 would be pretty decent while providing a good discount on the price. if it\u2019s too high, you might have to include the cost of renewing the shutter, but it\u2019s another step and hassle. (cost varies depending on cameras)\n \n* warranty: we called grey market, any product coming from export (usually asia). those products are cheaper (even brand new), but if something happens, it\u2019s gonna be harder for you to claim warranty. i would suggest to buy grey market lens but stick to classic market bodies (buy the camera in an approved retailer in your country for instance). well, the product is the same, so it\u2019s up to you, is the price gap worth it ? personally, all my gear is grey market.\n \n* kit lenses: in general, avoid them, i\u2019m talking about the 18-55mm you usually get with your cameras. this lens is gonna be useless for k-pop and the quality is usually bad. i would suggest you to buy a prime lens instead (50mm f/1.8 is a good one, regardless of cameras as each brand got their own affordable option). for k-pop uses, 18-55mm is not enough range in general anyway so you don\u2019t need it. here is a photo i took using my very first set-up with a 18-55mm. (at 55mm range), and here is the zoomed version. on another hand, here is a picture i took using a canon 50mm f/1.8 stm on a crop sensor, you can see that i\u2019m lacking a bit of range, but the quality is way better. my advise: buy a 70-200mm instead and get yourself a 35mm or 50mm for wider shoot. (as those primes are usually between 100/200\u20ac so quite affordable.)\n \n* used lens: a lot of lenses, especially the professional ones are built like tanks so they have quite a long lifespan so it\u2019s quite easy to buy a used lens. however, what you have to check is the state of the glass, is it ok ? check for fungus  and any defect possible, look from one end and the other, is there dust inside ? also, try the lens if you can, especially the focus system as it can go off if there is an issue inside.\n* \naccronyms:\n\n* image stabilization: it got different names depending on manufacturers:\n * canon: is = image stabilization\n * nikon: vr = vibration reduction\n * sony: oss = optical steady shot\n * sigma: os = optical stabilization\n * tamron: vc = vibration control\n* lens format: full frame and aps-c designed lenses got their names as well:\n * canon: ef for full frame and ef-s for aps-c\n * nikon: fx for full frame and dx for aps-c\n * sony: fe for full frame and e for aps-c\n* quality indicator: for expensive shits\n * canon: got an \u201cl\u201d after the aperture to indicate professional oriented lens,\n * sony: g master serie\n * tamron: sp for super performance\n * sigma: a = art, s = sport, c = contempory ; it\u2019s the uses for which the lens was designed for\n * nikon: i have no fucking idea, they don\u2019t have one i think\nthey are also other accronyms but they are less important i would say.\n\n            what to buy beside camera+lens ?\n\n* batteries: if you are using a dslr camera, i would suggest you to buy at least one additionnal battery, because if you are shooting non stop during a fansign, you will end low on battery after 2 hours (talking from experience), so just in case, have some safety measure. also, get official batteries, the third batteries are cheaper but their lifespan is way shorter. when shooting mirrorless, you might need more because the batteries don\u2019t usually last as long as the dslr counterparts.\n \n* battery grip: it\u2019s an accessory that you put at the bottom of you camera that brings 2 things. one, is a slot for another battery, your camera will have 2 batteries in it, so you don\u2019t have to change it during a session. two, is the ease to shoot vertical photos since they are additional commands on a battery grip. this is why for dreamcatcher london, all my photos are horizontal, but for dreamcatcher amsterdam, i have some vertical shots as i have the grip with me. i would also suggest to get official battery grip since it\u2019s linked to the camera system, but it\u2019s expensive as fuck for what it is, it\u2019s up to you eventually. you can still shoot vertically, it\u2019s just not as convenient.\n \n* memory cards: depending on your cameras, you might need to use sd cards (most frequent nowadays), cfast cards or xqd. check that your computer can read those cards, would be sad if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t forget to get an adapter then. for your memory card, you need something that can handle the storage needed, and the speed. for a lot of cameras, the sd card you want needs to have a uhs-i written on it (or u1), it\u2019s a speed norm that quite some cameras have right now. uhs-ii is for high-end cameras, so just ignore as it\u2019s not that common anyway. if you\u2019re planning on shooting non-stop during an event, the memory card is gonna have to be handle more, as a reference, for a fansign of 2 hours, with a canon 80d (which have a good speed and buffer), i have almost 6000 photos for 150go. however, this is me and i\u2019m an insane shooter, spamming that fucking button. i would recommend 2 64go cards or a single 128go card, this is a good start and should be able to handle all your needs.\n \n* flashes: clearly not needed in almost all situations, but it might come handy in some rare situations, like airport or exterior night shooting. do not use them during dance performance, and fansigns, it\u2019s bad etiquette and you\u2019ll probably be asked to get it off or worse, be kicked. don\u2019t need to buy an official flash (canon, nikon, sony) as they are too expensive for the uses we have, instead, get a third party one that can be as good, like any yongnuo one. flash should be the least of your worry anyway. an example for what flash can bring: handong after the amsterdam concert.\n \n* tripod/monopod: a tripod is a stand for your camera to rest, this is an extremly convenient item and i suggest you to buy one if you can, they are especially useful in fansigns. the tripod will allow you to reduce the shake since you don\u2019t have to carry your camera anymore, and it\u2019s more \u2026 energy friendly, holding a dslr for hours is tiring, believe me. a monopod has the same purpose but it\u2019s on one leg instead, so, less stable as you can\u2019t just leave the camera there, but you\u2019re more mobile so if you have to move, it\u2019s good.\n\n        what do we need for k-pop ?\n\nmost of k-pop events can be either outdoor or indoor, so you should stick to the worse scenarios to base your purchase on, which is : indoor and low light. so you need something that can be used in this situation.\n\n* aperture: f/2.8 is a good aperture in low light without an inconvenient depth of field, so this should be your go to aperture. f/1.8 or f/2 are also good options but those lenses are not as common beside the prime.\n \n* focal lenght: 70-200mm should be your go-to lens, it\u2019s an extremly versatile focal lenght and should cover a great part of your needs. in very rare situation, where you are really close, a 35mm prime should be great to compensate or a standard zoom (24-70mm). this applies for aps-c as well, but you can find  yourself a bit tight by 70 (as it\u2019s about 110mm full frame equivalent), so a wider lens might be needed, although, in most cases, it\u2019s ok. for the kard showcase, i was at second line, so very close and the 70-200mm on my crop sensor felt a bit tight sometimes, i couldn\u2019t get a full body shot of somin when she was in front for instance.\n \n* extra focal lenght: in some situations, 200mm may not be enough, for instance if your seat is far in a fansign, or during a dance performance. there are two options:\n \n * extender: it\u2019s something you put between the camera and the lens, they usually increase the range by 1.4 or 2. however, there will be a degradation of the image quality, and if you are using a 1.4 extender, you will lose one stop of ligt (f/2.8 to f/4, f/4 to f/5.6, etc.). the focus speed will also be slower.\n * another lens\u2026 sigma 150-600mm , nikon 200-500mm, tamron 150-600mm should be the main ones unless you have thousands of euros, then go for prime telefoto lens, but it\u2019s above my knowledge (considering that a lens can go over 6000\u20ac so \u2026).\n\n* iso performance: you are gonna need a camera that can get a maximum iso of at least 6400, because in dark environment (concert room for instance), you\u2019re gonna reach that maximum\u2026\n \n* video: something that can film 1080p at 60fps is a sweet spot, most cameras can do 1080p 30fps so it should be fine, but if you\u2019re aiming to get fancams, over photos, 60fps is needed. unless you go 4k 30fps, but getting into 4k is more expensive.\n\n        camera bodies recommendations\n\ni will focus most likely on aps-c and full frame bodies, and all the price will be new and grey market, and without the kit lens. so you\u2019re gonna have to adjust the price for your country if don\u2019t want grey market (add something like 20/25%). also, you are gonna have to do your own research, i\u2019m just leading you on a path, as they are more to just what i show there.\n\n \n\n\ncanon 60d

won\u2019t work well. if it does, you will have some serious quality drop so, is it worth it ?\n\nthe lenses i recommend, all prices will be new, and grey market, so you might notice some differences, and buying a lens used isn\u2019t an issue at all: (sorted from cheaper to out of mind)\n\n* canon ef-s 55-250mm f/4-5.6 is stm:\n * 150\u20ac (only get the stm version, the previous ones are

a long range telefoto lens\n\n* canon ef 70-200mm f/2.8l is usm ii:\n * 1400\u20ac\n * worse value than the tamron one, but better at long range and slightly faster focus speed\n * the classic white lens you see everywhere\n\n* sony fe 70-200 f/4 gm oss: \n * 1400\u20ac\n * the cheap alternative for sony xd\n * lens is good despite the f/4\n\n* canon ef 100-400 f/4.5-5.6l is usm ii: \n *

worse value than the tamron one for not an actual better option but if you want proprietaire option, it\u2019s this one\n\n* canon ef 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6l is usm:\n * 1700\u20ac\n * it\u2019s an extremly versatile lens, but at the cost of image quality, but at least, you won\u2019t need any other lens. it\u2019s still an l lens, so quality is enough in most situation.\n * the wide end is very

as sharp as the 70-200mm but image quality is still nice\n * canon or nikon option\n\n* sidenote: for sony bodies, you can use a converter to get canon mount lenses on the sony bodies, you don\u2019t lose much on image quality, but the issue is focus speed as it\u2019s not as reliable, also, it can varies quite a bit from a lens to another. look for metabones speedboosters and sigma converter.\n\n        tripod recommendations\n\nanything that that suit all the below characteristic :\n\n* it can reach your eye level while being seated\n* it can withstand twice the weight of your heavier camera set up\n* is aluminium (because cheaper)\n* you shouldn\u2019t go over 150\u20ac, and a lot of good options around 100\u20ac\n\nthe manfrotto befree is quite popular, really light, good enough height, and can support 4kg, which is enough for a 70-200mm set up.\n\nfor anything standing, i would suggest a monopod, some tripod can have some leg converted as a monopod, so, why not. also, you can just stick to a monopod, instead of a tripod, it\u2019s fine, but i personally like having the option to just leave the camera there. you can also look up for video monopod that can stand on their own but they are quite expensive for the good ones.\n\n    **[tutorial] camera gearing guide for k-pop \u2013 settings, shooting, and post process (part 3/3)**\n\nthe last part of the camera tutorials will be focused on settings and to use your cameras for what we need.\n\nfirst of all, go and set the camera on m mode, which is the manual mode.\n\n    camera settings\n\n* white balance: you should just put it on auto. this is one less thing to worry about, as it can change from a scene to another quite frequently, and since it can be easily corrected in post process, it\u2019s ok.\n \n* iso: in most cases, you should put it on auto as well, however, you can still tune it a bit. you can set a maximum iso for the auto mode to reach, the max you set is gonna depend on situation. for the dreamcatcher concert, i set it at 8000 max in amsterdam, because i got some shots at 10 000 in london, and it was too much. since in a dance performance, the lights are gonna change a lot, auto iso is necessary. for more calm scene, like, in a fanmeeting or fansign, you can fix the iso yourself for a better control of the image. however, in a fansign, from one member to another, the light can be different so keep that in mind.\n \n* exposure composition: it\u2019s the black and white +/- symbol combo, in general, it\u2019s best to have a slightly underexposed picture, so you can go to -0.3 to -1, don\u2019t go too much. letting it at 0 is also fine, this is not a decisive factor in image quality anyway.\n \n* shutter speed: you need something fast enough to freeze the moments (no blurr), and something slow enough to let enough light and limit noise. what i use right now:\n \n * 1/125 for posing idols, where the subject will freeze himself for a shot time\n * 1/200 and 1/250 for talking and reaction capture, slow paced stuff in general\n * 1/400 and 1/640 for dance performance, depending on dance, you can also change it, but for dreamcatcher for instance, i find those two shutter speeds to be in a sweet spot. the hair are sometimes a bit soft on 1/400, this is why i\u2019m also using 1/640 depending on songs.\n\n* aperture: always go to the lowest value possible, it\u2019s especially true with variable aperture lens, as it change depending on the range. it can happen to forget to put it back to the lowest. one exception is that you have a really fast lens (below f/1.8) and you are close enough to the subject, you might want to tune it a bit. but considering that f/2.8 is quite the standard, it shouldn\u2019t happen much.\n \n* file: shoot raw in priority, and if you are lacking storage \u2026 yeah, go jpg. if you have two cards slot, one good option is to shoot raw on main card and jpeg on second card as you have a back up just in case the main card die. however, this will add a strain on the camera so it will be slower (buffer size), so it\u2019s up to you. i personnaly set my second card on overload option as i want to keep my momentum while shooting.\n \n* focus mode: depending on the camera, try to get the focus mode dedicated to moving subject, this will help you track the subject across your screen more accurately. also, choose the largest possible area (highest numer of cross focus points) to focus. in mirrorless, you also have face detect and eye detect, those are good options in general. you might want to try the settings yourself to see what suits you the most.\n\n* button configuration: in general, to get a photo on a fresh camera, you push the trigger halfway, it focuses, then, you fully push and it shoot. what i find more convenient tho is to configure one button to focus, and let the trigger to shoot pictures, regardless of the focus. you have to choose a conveniently placed button (under the thumb ideally), and that is not important in general, and configure it to af-on (autofocus on). on my nikon, it\u2019s the ae-l button that i decided to switch off. note: you also have to configure it on the battery grip if you have one and the camera settings propose this option.\n \n* video settings: i would suggest to shoot at least at 1080p 60fps, but if you can, shoot 4k, even if it\u2019s 30fps. when shooting video, you can change the shutter speed to adapt to the record.\n \n * 25fps = 1/50 / 50fps = 1/100\n * 30fps = 1/60 / 60fps = 1/120\n* then, the bitrate, if your memory card can handle it, choose the higher bitrate everytime. this will put a strain on your memory card, and the post process since the video will weight more, but better have good quality from the start than regretting it later.\n \n* shooting mode: you can have different modes: single shot, quiet single shot,  continuous high speed, continious low speed, continuous quiet, delay, bulb. it can be a bi", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 14488,

I have a well made tripod I know how to use. I will scout the area during the daytime\n\nThe problem is I cannot stay in the park overnight because everything is booked. I must stay at a place near the park. The park is closed from 10pm-6am. I don't know if I must leave the park by 10pm or if I can stay afterwards; I must check on that. On Oct. 12, moonset is at 10pm. On Oct. 13, it's at 10:45pm.\n\nWhere in the park are some interesting places to capture the fall colors with other interesting elements? I know that landscape shots require a good foreground and background. Where is a good spot for the Milky Way shots? Is the Milky Way visible in Mid October? What are some good websites or apps that can help me with all of this?

I dabble. I'm not the best at it. My talents tend to lean elsewhere, but I like to go out and shoot street a bit to relax because there's so little pressure. For the most part, when I'm doing street photography I'm not worried about capturing a perfect shot that's going to get me another client. I'm just shooting. So, that out of the way let me dive into the meat of this. \n\nThere are valid complaints to be had. A lot of street photography that gets pushed, simply, isn't good. Street photography in general is more about capturing a certain moment and exploring a community more than being technically spot on. While I appreciate that, it also leads to a bunch of people selling themselves as street shooters when in reality they're just snapshot takers. \n\nOne thing I do disagree with though is a certain sentiment and that's the idea that people should not have the right to take a person's picture in public without permission. \n\nClearly, every country has different laws. But, in my case, I'm discussing the United States. I'm sorry for anyone else, but maybe with this post I can attempt to tell you why the laws forbidding this in your country are wrong and why people in the United States should fight to make sure we never have them here. \n\nHere's the obvious point: these are public places. You have no expectation of privacy in a public place. That doesn't mean people are allowed to harass you or assault you. But in terms of \"I have a right not to have my picture taken\" simply, no you don't, because you're in public. \n\nNow, branching off of that point there are several topics that usually come up and get thrown at photographers: \n\n1. Treat others as you would like to be treated. \n\n2. The internet is big and scary. \n\n3. You're a creeper. \n\n4. The right to be forgotten\n\n5. You gain nothing by not asking permission. \n\n6. The world gains nothing from this \"art.\" \n\n**Treat others as you want to be treated** \n\nBelieve it or not, when I'm doing street photography, I usually do try to ask people for permission to shoot them simply because I'm usually not the run and gun type of photographer. I tend to hang around a spot and try different angles and if there's a couple people that I'm hovering around they're going to get uncomfortable if I'm using my little Fuji (oddly enough, if I show up with my Nikon D5 and a big lens, no one usually gives a single care about me shooting because they simply presume I'm with a newspaper or something). Uncomfortable people make for bad photos and possible confrontations and I just want to avoid that, so I'll say \"Hey, I'm doing some street photos for fun, do you mind?\" \n\nYes? Ok. Cool. \n\nNo? Ok, see you later. \n\nI fully believe in the idea of treating people as I would want to be treated. I have no problem with someone taking photos of me in public. I don't do things in public that I don't want other people to see. I do those things in private. \n\n**The internet is big and scary** \n\nIt is. But, so is the world. One of the biggest complaints I hear about street photographers is that they're essentially offering up strangers to the deep dark and scary internet to ravage and destroy. \n\nIt is not a photographer's job to mitigate the risk of other people who chose to step out into the world. [I wrote an entire blog piece over this point awhile back](http://bobbyellisphotos.net/blog-1/2016/10/3/just-ask-first-the-debate-of-consent-and-photography). \n\nAs I say in that post, public space is an arena of spectacle and no one is forcing you to go into it. Especially in today's world where you can literally have your groceries delivered to your door. \n\nNot having your picture on the internet does not stop the pervert on the street from seeing you in a skirt and going home with the memory. \n\nNot getting your picture taken eating a hotdog at a festival during a workday does not protect you from the possibility that your boss may be there and see that you lied when you called in sick. \n\nNot having your picture taken does not stop kids from laughing at your stupid screen printed shirt when you walk by and them talking about it on Twitter. \n\nHell, even giving permission to have your photo taken and published doesn't stop some bored person from grabbing that picture and turning you into some weird creature with photoshop and posting you on their DeviantArt page. \n\nPut simply, I don't put stock in this argument because it ignores all the dangers of the real world and substitutes them with other dangers. \n\nThe internet is big and scary, but so is the whole world. \n\nAlso, I have yet to see anyone make the argument that we shouldn't share the tweets of someone who might have made a bad racist joke. \n\nHow is that relevant?

Even if you have every single photo subject sign a waiver and give you permission, there's no way of knowing what a photographer is going to do when they get their pictures back to the privacy of their own home. For all we know, the old lady taking family portraits could be doing terrible things in the privacy of her home with those pictures. I just don't find it a good excuse to go off on street photographers. \n\n**The right to be forgotten**\n\nNow, there are going to be a lot of people out there who probably disagree wholeheartedly with me on this point, but I don't believe in the \"right\" to be forgotten. Mostly because I think it leads to a slippery slope of misuse. \n\nThis is a really broad topic, and one that could make a giant post all on its own.

Great. No worries. \n\nBut, why do I shoot without asking in the first place? \n\nBecause, sometimes there are just moments that happen that don't let you stop the person and give a speech about what you're doing. \n\nThere are seconds in time that pass and don't come back. \n\nTo use a few of my own shots (not that they're great): \n\n[Random fireworks on the street.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/137533523@N04/28097590535/in/dateposted-public/)\n\n[Street artists.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/137533523@N04/26290204802/in/dateposted-public/) \n\n[A special ray of sun.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/137533523@N04/34620452045/in/dateposted-public/) \n\n[A quick glance.](https://www.instagram.com/p/_ipB7lM1zC/) \n\nSometimes, things just happen and taking the time to stop the person to ask them permission would break that magic. \n\nThe fact is that street photography helps give us a window into the everyday lives of normal people and communities.

[i wrote an entire blog piece over this point awhile back](http://bobbyellisphotos.net/blog-1/2016/10/3/just-ask-first-the-debate-of-consent-and-photography). \n\nas i say in that post, public space is an arena of spectacle and no one is forcing you to go into it. especially in today's world where you can literally have your groceries delivered to your door. \n\nnot having your picture on the internet does not stop the pervert on the street from seeing you in a skirt and going home with the memory. \n\nnot getting your picture taken eating a hotdog at a festival during a workday does not protect you from the possibility that your boss may be there and see that you lied when you called in sick. \n\nnot having your picture taken does not stop kids from laughing at your stupid screen printed shirt when you walk by and them talking about it on twitter. \n\nhell, even giving permission to have your photo taken and published doesn't stop some bored person from grabbing that picture and turning you into some weird creature with photoshop and posting you on their deviantart page. \n\nput simply, i don't put stock in this argument because it ignores all the dangers of the real world and substitutes them with other dangers. \n\nthe internet is big and scary, but so is the whole world. \n\nalso, i have yet to see anyone make the argument that we shouldn't share the tweets of someone who might have made a bad racist joke. \n\nhow is that relevant? they're putting those tweets up in a public place where anyone can see and share them. \n\nit's kind of like how when you go outside, anyone can see you and tell others. \n\n**you're a creeper**\n\nhere's what i have to say on this subject. \n\nthere's no freaking way of knowing. even if you have every single photo subject sign a waiver and give you permission, there's no way of knowing what a photographer is going to do when they get their pictures back to the privacy of their own home. for all we know, the old lady taking family portraits could be doing terrible things in the privacy of her home with those pictures. i just don't find it a good excuse to go off on street photographers. \n\n**the right to be forgotten**\n\nnow, there are going to be a lot of people out there who probably disagree wholeheartedly with me on this point, but i don't believe in the \"right\" to be forgotten. mostly because i think it leads to a slippery slope of misuse. \n\nthis is a really broad topic, and one that could make a giant post all on its own. rather than dive into that, i'm going to post a link to an oxford debate on the subject. the people discussing it there are much more knowledgeable and articulated than me so i don't see the point in trying to butcher their discussion for my needs. \n\n[please, feel free to give it a listen and come to your own conclusions.](https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/us-should-adopt-right-be-forgotten-online) \n\n**you gain nothing from not asking permission/this isn't art**\n\ni'm combining these two because i feel like they pretty much fall under the same umbrella. \n\ni don't enjoy this, so it must not be good. \n\ncoming from a journalistic background, 90 percent of the time, if i photograph someone, even without permission, i'm going to ask their name afterwards which is pretty much me saying \"can i get your consent?\" \n\nsometimes people say they don't want a picture taken of them, in which case i don't use the photo, or they say they just don't want their name attributed to it. great. no worries. \n\nbut, why do i shoot without asking in the first place?

I'm only posing this question to see what people think. I'm not exactly for something like a license to take professional pictures as I don't believe we should license every little thing and involve government entities or fees just to take pictures... but I have been thinking about it a lot lately as I look around and feel overwhelmed by the saturation of people with cameras out there as well as some crackdowns/restrictions on photo\\-taking opportunities.\n\nOne point that comes to mind is there are an abundance of entry\\-level to amateurish photographers out there who have this misplaced burst of confidence after purchasing a camera or getting a few likes on some Facebook post. They then think they can suddenly operate a wedding photo business and will charge $200, putting actual wedding shooters in a bad spot. I just think it's funny that many of us will hire a licensed plumber to fix a toilet, but don't entirely consider a photographer's credibility if the price is right. And I know we all gotta start somewhere so having a license off the bat doesn't help those who want to build their portfolio, so it could cause an uproar.\n\nAnother point, and one I am more for, is licensing photographers who want to shoot in places at odd hours. For example, here in New Jersey, state parks close at dusk, and one of these parks offers some awesome Milky Way photo opportunities in the late winter. Unfortunately, you must lie and say you're a fisherman, who are able gain night access, or write to obtain an expensive, onetime permit just to do it. A license would alleviate a lot of confusion and separate legit photographers from those who are up to no good. \n\nI understand a license would cause a lot of other problems like creating a challenge for amateurs to prove their worth in photography if they want to be taken seriously. Also who would be the gatekeeper to access this license and what would a photographer need to do to qualify for it? I know this would limit hobbyists who do not want to be professionals from throwing their hat in the ring and I know this could limit exposure to only a select few.

Just head down to TL;DR at bottom**\n\nHello world. I've had a DSLR with kit lens for the past 6 years and surprise surprise, I've hardly touched it as it just sat there in dust. However, last year my friend asked me to take pictures of his engagement. I made it very clear I was not a professional in any way. But since we had to drive 8 hours to surprise her, I was the only option.  I decided to rent a pro lens thanks to the wondleful advice on this sub.\n\nThe auto pictures came out much better. (I didn't realize exposure compensation was -3 the entire time.) Most of the iPhone pictures her brothers took were way better. I was a little discouraged and returned the lens and continued to not touch the camera for another year. \n\nFast forward to this year and i finally have a stable work schedule, much cheaper and safer apartment, disposable income, and most importantly, I'm getting treatment on my lifelong struggle with dibilitating mental illness/PTSD. Many times I thought I'd have to sell my DSLR for a couple hundred dollars to get through the month, but for some reason I refused to get rid of it. \n\n I've been learning about photography more and more though i don't know what triggered it. I had that itch. The same one I get every time I come across a beautiful photo. I decided to act on it and bring my camera with me every weekend up to Maine when I visit my SO. Mostly just messing around and experimenting with various settings and just focusing on having pictures with correct exposure and focus. YouTube tutorials on light balance, ISO,  shutter speed, aperature and auto focus saved me. \n\nFast forward to last month it turns out my SO has an audition with a well known local theatre! She mentioned that she needed to get new headshots done since hers are 5+ years old. I half joked that I would do it, but then I really thought about all I learned and decided this would be my first attempt to get back at Photography. I made it perfectly clear that I wanted to shoot her as a personal growth project and if she needed better pictures, she should hire a professional since a good headshot is absolutely critical in her line of work and no feeling will be hurt. \n\nFor two weeks leading up to the shoot, I studied the basic foundations of photography the best I could every opportunity of free time I got. I couldn't sleep I was so excited about thinking of the shots I would want to take. What I want my style to be like. What kind of pictures I like and don'r like. I felt like I've dipped my foot into the photography community (Lurking  here included) and I loved every second of it. \n\nResearch told me I should decide on getting an upgrade at my lowly kit lens. I decided I wanted something sharp with some stabilization and decently low f stop for creamy bokeh. I decided that my first lens I bought would be a portrait/macro lens which should really get the kinds of shots I'm looking for. \n\nThat means i needed an upgrade. I bit the bullet and bought a used [Tamron 90mm lens](https://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Tamron/Tamron-SP-90mm-F28-Di-MACRO-11-VC-USD-Nikon-mounted-on-Nikon-D5200__850)  to go on my Nikon D5100 for under $500. Yes this lens on a cropped sensor results in an actual focal length of 135mm and 4.2 f-stop which makes low light pictures and tight spaces nearly impossible. However, I'd rather use this lens for a long time and buy an older model Nikon full frame (d600 or 610?) than purchase a lens that would only be ideal for a crop body. \n\nShot for an hour and took about 400 pictures! Actually filled up my memory card and had to quickly delete some because golden hour was running out. The fact that my SO is a former model was a huge help since she knew how to pose herself and do things with her face since I hardly had time to research posing. For the first time, a couple of the images I saw on that LCD screen really took my breath away. I was doing it! \n\n\nSince that shoot, I've been taking pictures on some level every day, but now I'm in that awkward spot between complete beginner and advanced photographer.  I'd like to experiment in headshots, portraits, macro and sports since my roommates coach their local men's league baseball teams. Ideally my next lens would unlock the potential for local band photography. \n\n\n\n**The Gear**\n\n[Nikon d5100 with Tamron 90mm ](https://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Tamron/Tamron-SP-90mm-F28-Di-MACRO-11-VC-USD-Nikon-mounted-on-Nikon-D5200__850) \n\n\nI've already ordered a [light stand kit from Newegg for $30](https://m.newegg.com/products/9SIA5KR1YR6528) and [flash kit with two VK750 II i-ttl speedlites with trigger, 2 receivers, 2 hard diffusers, and 2 soft diffusers for $124](neewer pro i-ttl flashdeluxe kit for nikon dslr d7100 d7000 d5300 d5200 d5100 d5000 d3200 d3100 d3300 d90 d800 d700 d300 d300s d610, d600, d4 d3s d3x d3 d200 n90s f5 f6 f100 f90 f90x d4s d slr camera- includes: 2 Neewer Auto-Focus Flashes + Wireless Trigger(1 Transmitter, 2 Receivers) +N1-Cord &amp; N3-Cord Cables + 2 Hard &amp; 2 Soft Flash Diffusers + 2 Lens Cap Holders https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1IO2V6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_KpHxBbD129484)\n\n\n\nTLDR: local professional photographer offers 1 hour lessons either on location or my place or his.

Our most common use of the camera is bringing it with us on vacations, and hiking. Even our vacations are heavy on hiking. We often use the 24-70 2.4L lens as the main carry.\n\nI think I am optimizing for: Weight/size, IQ, and dynamic range.\n\nI think weight/size makes sense &amp; is clear, because of vacations &amp; hiking. Awfully nice if we can drop a gram or two.\n\nWhen we finish our photos, we love to do photo books &amp; print large canvases for our home. So I think maintaining the image quality of the 6D would be a minimal bar. It'd be a nice bonus if any quality improved (for the larger canvases in particular).\n\nFinally, dynamic range. Since we're hiking &amp; taking photos (rather than taking photos &amp; hiking), we often end up at beautiful spots at mid-day. We often have blown out highlights (or darks), because the lighting isn't optimal. My thought is that dynamic range might slightly expand the number of photos we could pull darks/lights out of, which otherwise would be too ugly to use ;)\n\nThe above make sense?\n\nIf the above makes sense, I was primarily deciding between the Canon EOS R (to keep the same lens system), and the Sony A7iii. I also considered the Sony A7Riii, but 1) I think the extra pixels aren't necessarily needed for our printing needs, and 2) I've heard a few things about DR &amp; autofocus &amp; battery life that make me think the A7iii (If I don't need the pixels) might be better.

(especially for Odonata) /!/ I never do this, and if it doesn't fit someone can remove it, but here goes my attempt to be social with reddit.\n\nI'm a naturalist first and a very amateur hobbyist nature photographer as a result of that. I love photography, but I don't shoot humans, or even human structures very often. I'm usually holding a crouch (to my knees protest) or down on hands and knees shooting insects and spiders, detailed plant pornography (flower parts), or other small stuff. I've learned a lot this summer as I dove back into it, so I'm hoping to share and maybe receive a few tips on improving in this kind of photography.\n\nDragonflies and damselflies are among my favourite subjects, and it's very much that time of year, so here are a few things I picked up while obsessively shooting them recently.\n\nA ring flash is a great investment all around, but I've found that with skittish damselflies if I can get one shot off without them retreating, they will often be a bit dazzled and stay put for subsequent shots. This is key, because if they're dazzled you can move side to side, and sometimes even start to loom over them for a top down shot without spooking them.\n\nI always try to approach Odonata species from the side, and never from above. In addition to that, I've found I can get much better results if I can approach them without changing the shape of my body profile. The way I do this is to start by kneeling in the potential spot until I find a suitable subject, and then moving one knee at a time by a few inches, kind of just shifting towards the subject. I'm not sure how to articulate it, but if you try it I think you'll understand. The point is to present the shape of your head and shoulders to the subject consistently, and without lateral movement. If I change shape (in profile or silhouette), move too much to a side, or increase in size to them too quickly (by moving in for the shot) they tend to take off.\n\nI've learned the value of sitting and waiting. I've also learned to let my body shift very slightly with the breeze and surrounding plants. Barely more movement than breathing, and it becomes instinctive after awhile. It sometimes seems like bugs are a bit less skittish this way, but more importantly it helps me relax and get better shots when something does show up.\n\nThere's also the mood of the subject. Dragonflies and damselflies have a ton of personality, and I've met individuals that were downright quirky. Trying to get a shot of the wrong damselfly will only lead to frustration. Some things cannot be forced, and until my sneak skill improves, I've learned to disregard some gorgeous insects as unshootable due to their current mood. If you sit and wait, chances are the one that lands will have something in its mouth. If not, it will be wanting to rest in the heat. Either way, it wants to be there and your presence isn't disturbing it. This makes it much easier than trying to creep up on them.\n\nAnd I think lastly since this is already long, I've found that deer flies and mosquitoes do in fact have a use on this planet. You heard that right. Deer flies for dragonflies, and mosquitoes for damselflies. If I spot an area rich in dragonflies, I'll detour to the nearest field to pick up deer flies. With them buzzing around my hat, I go visit the dragonflies. It's such a cool sound when one buzzes your ear to snap up a deer fly.\n\nThe important thing is, when they catch prey they generally land to eat. If I can find a position with accessible plants for perching nearby, sometimes they will grab a fly and land more or less where I can shoot. They're chill because they have a meal, so if I can get that first shot off (with the flash), I can sometimes get something nice.\n\nHere are a few of my [recent shots](https://imgur.com/a/c8QgwRf) that I enjoy, just so you guys know I'm not talking out of my ovipositor (if I had one).

When you first start with street photography, you will find yourself keeping your distance before you really dive into the crowd, and a smartphone is actually really good for both. For instance, you might be on a public transport, like the tram, metro or bus and want to shoot something inside that vehicle; no one will take notice of someone on the phone if you don't do the most complex body excercises to get a shot. You could also act like you're just browsing or whatever people do these days on their smartphones. Remember: the best camera is the one you have with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I don't have a lot of money to spent but want good image quality (the 500$ tier / obviously cheaper is also possible)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you are looking for is a 'point-and-shoot'-camera. There are lots of those, they are mostly on the wider side (\\~28mm), but they have good image quality, some even do RAW, they are small, portable and don't draw that much attention.  \nThe best point and shoot I can recommend right now is the Fujifilm XF10, which is \\~450$. It's APS-C, 24MP, equivalent to 28mm, does ISO 100 to 51200 and has an apperture range from 2.8 to 16. It can be controlled fully manually if one wishes to, has contrast and phasee detect AF and works 0\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 Celsius / 32\u00b0 to 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit and tolerates 10 to 80% humidity.  \nIt has actually everything you could want if you don't need a faster apperture and are fine with being limited to a single focal length. Keep in mind close up portraits will have distortion. For your instagram, it will be fine, as 24MP is more than enough pixeles to allow you to crop a lot. And it does RAW. It has lots of stuff for its price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The 1000$ tier (from here on keep in mind lens prices are not included / you would want a 28mm, 35mm, 40mm or 50mm - read up on what you would want at the bottom)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSony a6000, a6300, Fujifilm X-T20, Fujifilm X-E3, Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III (well that's an easy to remember camera name)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The 1500$ tier**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFujifilm X-Pro2, Fujifilm X-T3, Sony a6500, Sony A7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Full Frame tier (above 2000$)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSony a7 III, because size matters. In our case, smaller is better; and the a7 III is small and really REALLY capable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The 'Money doesn't matter' tier**  \n\n\nLeica M10P, Fujifilm GFX 50R (remember we are talking street so you kind of want 'compact' cameras - the Fuji is a brick, but small for a medium format)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lenses**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally, glas is more important than your cameras body. If you have the best camera but a terrible lens, you will get terrible image quality in terms of sharpness and distortion (alos cromatic abberation and so on...). There are over 50 available lenses for Sony, ranging from 100 to multiple thousand dollars. You will find a suitable lens for street that is affordable in this lineup. Fujis lenses are more expensive and they are metal only on the outside - 23mm (which is 35mm equivalent) and 35mm (that's 50mm) are at around 350 to 500, depending where you live.

Look for breaks in those shadows where the light hits the entire wall. Shoot people as they walk in, out or just in the middle of that light breach. That's the really basic street shot. Depending on your focal length, you might want to look up architectur photography, as with wider lenses you will want to put your subjects in relation to mostly architecture. You want recurring shapes and/or colors, interesting shadows. If you go from there, it's all learning by doing. Also reflections of big glas window buildungs onto an overshadowed road work well - basically, look for where shadow and light do interesting things together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this is of help to someone out there, for most photo people it's common knowledge, but maybe YOU are the person who doesn't dare to ask and took something away from this.\n\nBe safe out there, I hope this doesn't read like an advertisement.\n\nOh, and: there are no rules in photography.

It was a really great night, and so I waited patiently for the event photographer I hired for the night to send our photos through.\n\nI received the photos earlier this week, and was disappointed with what I saw. Many of the portrait photos of the guests are extremely unflattering (shooting from a low angle looking up, causing double chins, cutting off feet, or too much floor, some have been included with guests\u2019 eyes closed, or where they are clearly not ready and pulling funny expressions etc) or have been taken with the doors to the bathrooms right next to it but hasn\u2019t cropped it out (an easy fix by me but shouldn\u2019t be necessary). In addition to that, and probably the most frustrating thing is that most of the photos to some degree or another, are blurred, some much worse than others, but basically none are totally sharp and clear. She has also edited many of the nicest photos into black and white, but not given the colour option also. \n\nI can almost get past all that. But, when my partner and I were looking through the photos together, he was looking forward to one photo in particular, of his group of friends. One had travelled interstate, one from another country to be there on the night, and it was rare for the whole group to be all together, so getting a photo together was pretty crucial. As we looked through the photos though.. no group photo of his friends was there, even though it was definitely taken. \n\nI have contacted the photographer thanking them for their services, but clarifying where the group photo was, and also wondering if it was possible to receive coloured versions of the black and white photos, as some of those are the nicest shots from the night (I didn\u2019t mention the blurriness or bad angles and I also didn\u2019t do the very very bad thing of asking for ALL photos). Her response sounded very negative, there was no apology, instead blaming a \u201cvery challenging mix of lighting\u201d so she edited them to black and white. She said the group photo of the friends was missing as it has some \u201cheavy shadowing due to where they were standing and she was not able to get them to move to the side and stand still long enough to achieve an outcome she would be happy with\u201d. \n\nIs this an acceptable response from someone who claims to be a professional and offers their services as an event photographer? The situation with the group photo.. I find that ridiculous. Isn\u2019t that her role as a photographer to coordinate people in a way so the moments can be captured? My partner had photos taken with others in the exact same spot prior to the group photo which were included, and he was not made aware of there being any issues of where they were standing. In terms of what she said about the challenging lighting, she was using a DSLR, that a friend at the party (who has studied photography and has qualifications so I trust her judgement) mentioned was a very expensive camera. This same friend also expressed much confusion when I showed her the photos of the night, about why her ISO would be so high, why the shots aren\u2019t focused on the subjects, why wasn\u2019t she checking the shots were acceptable throughout the night, etc. The photographer didn\u2019t use a flash and claimed on the night she didn\u2019t like to use it as it turns people\u2019s faces much too white and bright, so I trusted she would still be able to capture acceptable photos without one.\n\nEssentially, it\u2019s evident that it\u2019s the case of\nsomeone buying an expensive camera and claiming to be a professional without the knowledge or experience to back it up.

It\u2019s tiring at times but looking back I think it\u2019s worth it.\n\nWhy do it in the first place?\nBecause I wanted to see how far I can go with being persistent in something small. And I wanted to see if it\u2019ll help improve my photography skills. And of course, I\u2019m into photography!\n\nSkill improvement\n- Better ability to spot beauty from the ordinary: Before this project, it was quite easy to just procrastinate on photo taking with excuses like  \u201cmy camera is too heavy\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m too busy\u201d, \u201cthe everyday surroundings are too dull\u201d, \u201cgood spots are too far away\u201d, etc. You get the idea. But after the project, I\u2019ve realized that by forcing yourself to take a good photo everyday, it really changes how you approach photography and how you view your everyday surroundings. It\u2019s simply not true that you need to go to certain awesome spots to get good photos. You could get it anywhere with any camera, as long as your mind is trained sufficiently in seeking for beauty.\n- Less is more: what I\u2019ve realized is that photography is really an art of subtraction. It\u2019s about subtracting distracting/unnecessary elements from the frame which causes visual disharmony, aka ugliness.

And that easily led to procrastination. But after engaging in this project, it\u2019s simply impossible to make every photo equally perfect. Thus I\u2019ve learnt to accept flaws, and how to improve the flaws using post processing tools like VSCO. It really helps in boosting my creative confidence.\n\nPromotion:\n- On IG, tags only helped me to go so far, before reaching my bottleneck. I went from 200 to 400 followers simply by using tags.

I don\u2019t know. \n- There\u2019re so many other techniques I\u2019ve read online about following/unfollowing others, placing the same comments on everyone to fake interest, etc., but it\u2019s frankly too much effort for me, as I\u2019m just an enthusiast at this stage. \n- At first I cared a lot.

In 2017, the brand and intellectual property of the Polaroid corporation were acquired by the largest shareholder of the Impossible Project, which had originally started out by producing new instant films for Polaroid cameras and was renamed Polaroid Originals in September 2017. Thus, Polaroid's masterpiece, the instant camera, is still with us.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cqs2j1lycsi11.png\n\nThis is the camera that make instantaneous printouts to hold, clip and paste. This conveniently compact camera fits in your pocket and requires no messy inks or expensive toners. Users don't need to fiddle with a flash or focus the lens; just\u00a0look through the pop-up viewfinder and click and out pops an adorable 2\"x 3\"sticky-backed picture ready to share with friends and family. Zink Zero Ink technology also helps save you a ton of money while keeping your memories alive. The 10-megapixel sensor captures millions of colors and tons of detail, while unique picture modes offer a variety of tones and filters to suit your mood. You can even add a 32-GB microSD card to save shots for social media or additional printing. However, the photo quality is not as good as that of a decent phone camera.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n**Instax Square SQ6**\n\nThis is a square format as a new addition to the instax series of instant camera lineup, allows users to enjoy on-the-spot photo printing. It is equipped with various features: with auto exposure control, the camera detects the ambient brightness and adjusts to provide the optimum shutter speed and flash light intensity, even in low light conditions. Three color filters that fit over the flash in orange, purple and green are included to add a pop of color to the images. Additionally, the camera can be set to a selfie mode which automatically adjusts focus and brightness. There is also a self-shot mirror attached to the side of the lens allowing you to check the shooting range.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8xhlfjb0dsi11.png\n\nBesides, SQ6 offers three unique modes, you can press the Mode button on the back of the camera\u00a0which you can choose between: the double exposure mode allows two photos to be overlapped on a single film when the shutter button is pressed twice; the macro mode allows users to capture beautiful close-up images of subjects up to a minimum of 30cm and the landscape mode can be used to capture long-range impressive scenic photos.\n\n**LG PC389S**\n\nThe LG Pocket Photo PC389S Instant Camera comes with a built-in printer. It uses dye-sublimation printing technology to output vibrant, high-quality prints onto 2.5 x 3.7\" adhesive-backed paper in around 45 seconds. The PC389S shoots photos with pixel perfection as well.\u00a0Each image encapsulates five million pixels of crisp detail to give a clear image with a radiant and full color spectrum.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5qbrhhh1dsi11.png\n\nLG's Pocket Photo App, available for iOS and Android, allows for image corrections to be made in addition to adding custom filters, decorations, and frames to your final photos.

The SP-2 has also a completely new design, featuring a silver or gold body with a sleek white casing and an internal rechargeable battery.\u00a0\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/snevjpj2dsi11.png\n\nYou can easily connect your phone to the printer via Wi-Fi and share access to your library of images with the free Instax Share app, which you can then use to do some minor editing and add a filter or a custom border. Thanks to a new laser exposure system, the new SP-2 's high-resolution 320 dpi print will be ready in just 10 seconds. So not only does it print faster, the pictures are a lot better as well. As for image files, the printer supports JPEG and PNG formats.\n\n**HP Sprocket 100**\n\nThe HP Sprocket is tiny and has a tiny output as well: the paper tray holds just 10 sheets, and the machine can only produce wallet-size, 2 x 3\" photos. This is because it uses the zero-ink technology, which uses heat-activated paper instead of ink or dye sublimation. Zink doesn't produce the most detailed prints and some of the colors appeared washed out. However, the look of these filtered colors may appeal to you.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fzd59sq3dsi11.png\n\nFor a novelty printer, printing off social media photos has never been easier from your smartphone. Connect your social media accounts to the free-to-download HP Sprocket App and instantly turn those photos into colorful prints.

It took about nine days. I worked on this when I had the time, but I'm finally done.\n\nHere is the commented imgur gallery of the work. It's shocking don't judge. I basically spent 2000-2006 traveling and 2 computers died, 3 hard drives crapped out, I kept backing stuff up, I got a desktop and downloaded everything, then saved it all on the same drive, exported my iPhoto library on two drives then combined the two drives.\n\nSo. There were 122,000 + photos with about 38,000 duplicates, which I only found out after I purchased Duplicate Detective for $4,99 on the App Store, because I'm on a Mac.\n\nDuplicate Detective worked for HOURS.
