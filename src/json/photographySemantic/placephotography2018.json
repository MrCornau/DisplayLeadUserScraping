Written by Isabelle Francq](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-88-6965-537-1)\n\nSebastio Salgado is, in my opinion, one of the greatest long-term social and humanitarian documentary photographers of our time. His projects often spanned several years in order to complete, and took him around the globe. They are often aimed at the human condition; from workers and labour, human migrations due to shifting geopolitical circumstances, to the struggle of people trying to find a place in the world to call home. His large scale photo projects are deeply moving, describing often the fragility of human life when faced with the violence we subject one another to, yet also our unending determination to overcome hardships and struggle - to endure against all odds.\n\n\nThis book is written by another great journalist, Isabelle Francq, who sat down with Salgado and recorded a long conversation detailing his life. It's read from Salagado's perspective, and provides wonderful insight to what drove the man to go to such lengths in order to bring his images and awareness to the world.\n\n\nHis photographs, including the black and white style, are the greatest inspiration for my photography. I am almost entirely unable to perform the type of work and documentary photography that Salgado has performed his entire life, yet I will always admire it.
