I just had my camera stolen and I wish I had ingested my media more often. /!/ This just happened a couple hours ago and I am still upset. I'm abroad traveling in my homeland and I take photos and videos for a \"growing\" fan base on YouTube and Instagram.

When we had gotten back, somone had broken in and stole my Canon T3i Rebel, Kit lens, 50mm f/1.8 prime lens, Rode Directional microphone, and camera stabilizer.  The gear must have totaled at least $1000 which might not be a lot for many but it is a crushing for an amature student.\n\nHowever, I can replace all my gear but I cannot replace the pictures and footage that was stored on my SD cards.

You never knew when you will break, lose, or have your gear stolen.\n\nEdit:\n\nYou guys have been very kind and have also given some great advice. I'll compile the tips here.\n\n* Car theft is very common everywhere. Do not leave your camera in the car unattended if you can help it.\n* On the off chance that you HAVE to leave it in a vehicle, stow it somewhere difficult to access. Stick it in the trunk, where no one is any the wiser that its there.\n* At the very least, put your memory card in your pocket.\n* BACKUP your photos, Backup your backups, and then back it up once more. Laptop, Hard drive, USB Stick, and the Cloud.\n* Memory is cheap, buy a lot of it\n* Wi-Fi cameras or cards can let you backup your photos quickly and automatically to your phone or tablet which may save you.\n\nLooking back, if I had taken some of this advice today then I would be in a much better spot.

This is basically around how I organise and plan my on-location shoots so that I can work to a location\u2019s strengths and ensure a successful shoot, as well as some example locations that are publicly accessible around my hometown, Sydney. This advice isn't for large commercial teams or projects - those will usually need permits. But if you\u2019re shooting light for creative/portfolio development, this advice may be right up your alley.\n\n\nI have to be quite flexible with the location for my shoots. I select a location based on one or more of the following factors: Shoot Style, Time of Day &amp; Geographical Area.\n\n\n**Shoot Style**\n\nThe style of shoot can be your biggest factor when selecting a location. This can include shooting for swim, street, activewear, or simply knowing you have to shoot at a particular location by request. If you\u2019re lucky though, you have creative control to influence this in some way. For example, swimwear may look just as good at a garden, beach house or pool and doesn\u2019t require a beach in sight. The more creative you are with your locations, the more interesting and novel your shoots could be.\n\n\nRecognise the strengths of different location types and adjust your shoot to take advantage of them. Keep a shortlist of locations that have worked for you so you\u2019re not starting from scratch for every shoot, which can be hard. I save my locations on Google Maps so I can review them when looking at the area I might look to shoot in. This is a godsend for me.\n\n\n**Time of Day**\n\nThis to me is the factor with the biggest impact on the look of your photos. When you don\u2019t have time to scout locations (and I don\u2019t), you can instead rely on a couple of great tools: Google Maps and [Suncalc](http://suncalc.net/). Suncalc overlays itself on Google Maps and shows you the arc of the sun throughout any day. It will give you a pretty good idea of where the sun will be, and based on the type of location you can use this to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for your aesthetic.\n\n\nFor example, shooting a late afternoon session on an east-facing beach will probably see you plunged into darkness well before sunset as the buildings cast a shadow over the whole beach. Using suncalc can instead help you find locations that might be facing more towards the sun and therefore get you more time to shoot (I use Vaucluse a lot for late afternoon shoots). Personally my favourite times of day are during sunrise and sunset so that I can get more interesting natural light punching through the shot, but that's just my style. When it comes to shooting inland, streetview and community-submitted photos are also your friend because buildings and elevation can limit the type of light you\u2019ll have and viewing the street imagery will help you see what you\u2019re in for.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a case to be made about shooting indoors - if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a place offered. I\u2019ve done a number of shoots in apartments and used the furnishings and decorations to modify the light and create some really great scenes. \n\n\nIf I\u2019m shooting when the sun is high in the sky, I look for man-made structures that can give me more interesting backgrounds, but can also shield myself and the model from the sun - or even act as a reflector to provide more even light. Fortunately the more limited you are the more creative you have to be. If you're struggling to find structures to help you, instead adjust poses to make use of the light. Embrace the harsh lighting! Focus instead on the leading lines, the shadows and the overall mood of the day that you and your model have control of.\n\n\n**Geographical Area**\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to address the location types available to you. If you live on the coast, you may have access to heaps of great beaches. If you live inland, not so much - but perhaps you can find a lake, lagoon, or pool if you need water. If you live in mountains and pick your time of day appropriately, you\u2019ll get some stunning images. I am fortunate to live in Sydney and have access to some of the greatest beach locations, but you\u2019ll find a lot of my work is shot all over Sydney or parkland a few hours out. Sometimes I just shoot down an alley. Check out your local tennis/basketball courts and book a slot when it\u2019s not busy. Use the colours and lines to your advantage.\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think you\u2019re limited by only having access to public spaces for shoots. But then I remember how I wouldn\u2019t have come up with a lot of the lighting, backdrops and poses without being challenged in the first place. Think critically about your surroundings - what types of public spaces are there? What about alleyways, or interesting homes? Rooftops, backyards, even carparks can all allow you to be creative and produce something amazing. Locations that I\u2019ve struggled with the most have yielded some of my favourite photos due to the unusual angles, lighting and backdrops that resulted from it.\n\n\n\n**TLDR:** Use Google Maps and [Suncalc](http://suncalc.net/).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/7ptpdu/making_locations_work_for_you/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "google maps", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "making locations work for you /!/ i wrote this on my website a few months ago, and thought it might be worth reposting here if it helps some new starters in portrait photography. this is basically around how i organise and plan my on-location shoots so that i can work to a location\u2019s strengths and ensure a successful shoot, as well as some example locations that are publicly accessible around my hometown, sydney. this advice isn't for large commercial teams or projects - those will usually need permits. but if you\u2019re shooting light for creative/portfolio development, this advice may be right up your alley.\n\n\ni have to be quite flexible with the location for my shoots. i select a location based on one or more of the following factors: shoot style, time of day &amp; geographical area.\n\n\n**shoot style**\n\nthe style of shoot can be your biggest factor when selecting a location. this can include shooting for swim, street, activewear, or simply knowing you have to shoot at a particular location by request. if you\u2019re lucky though, you have creative control to influence this in some way. for example, swimwear may look just as good at a garden, beach house or pool and doesn\u2019t require a beach in sight. the more creative you are with your locations, the more interesting and novel your shoots could be.\n\n\nrecognise the strengths of different location types and adjust your shoot to take advantage of them. keep a shortlist of locations that have worked for you so you\u2019re not starting from scratch for every shoot, which can be hard. i save my locations on -----> google !!!

  \nam i wrong in assuming that a light with poor cri could still have the correct overall colour tone?   \n", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 36429, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 290529, "autor": "didykong", "date": 1540573277000, "content": "Official : Lightroom map view no longer available on perpetual licenses by the end of November 2018 /!/ Adobe has [annonced](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/map-view-no-longer-supported.html) the end of map view for perpetual licenses of Lightroom.\n\n* Lightroom 4 and 5 : The map module has been discontinued.\n* Lightroom CC 2015.x / Lightroom 6.x : Map view will be discontinued starting on November 30, 2018\n* Lightroom Classic CC 7.x : upgrade to Lightroom Classic 8.0 to be able to use map view from November 30, 2018\n\n**Reason**\n\n\"A change in Map calls has been made.\"\n\n This is probably linked to the Google Map API price rise in July 2018.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9rmjmk/official_lightroom_map_view_no_longer_available/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "official : lightroom -----> map !!!  view no longer available on perpetual licenses by the end of november 2018 /!/ adobe has [annonced](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/map-view-no-longer-supported.html) the end of map view for perpetual licenses of lightroom.\n\n* lightroom 4 and 5 : the map module has been discontinued.\n* lightroom cc 2015.x / lightroom 6.x : map view will be discontinued starting on november 30, 2018\n* lightroom classic cc 7.x : upgrade to lightroom classic 8.0 to be able to use map view from november 30, 2018\n\n**reason**\n\n\"a change in map calls has been made.\"\n\n this is probably linked to the google map api price rise in july 2018.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 37056, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 290797, "autor": "Shoryouken", "date": 1542108488000, "content": "What inspired me to become a photographer PLUS a map of photography locations I visited in Iceland 3 years ago /!/  \n\nHello guys.\n\nI started writing my photography blog about my past trips.  \nSome of you might enjoy it and there is a useful map I created in 2016.  \nLet me know what you think and if you found this useful.\n\n[Our Icelandic Adventure](https://www.pristine-view.com/blog/2018/11/11/so-it-begins)\n\nOr if you do not want to read my Blog entry just click on:\n\n[Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1UdWUzOnxH_0KJ_XScOt8qZlNls4&amp;ll=64.74170616305199%2C-18.86649125000008&amp;z=7)\n\nHope ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9wo9qr/what_inspired_me_to_become_a_photographer_plus_a/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "what inspired me to become a photographer plus a -----> map !!!  of photography locations i visited in iceland 3 years ago /!/  \n\nhello guys.\n\ni started writing my photography blog about my past trips.  \nsome of you might enjoy it and there is a useful map i created in 2016.  \nlet me know what you think and if you found this useful.\n\n[our icelandic adventure](https://www.pristine-view.com/blog/2018/11/11/so-it-begins)\n\nor if you do not want to read my blog entry just click on:\n\n[map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1udwuzonxh_0kj_xscot8qzlnls4&amp;ll=64.74170616305199%2c-18.86649125000008&amp;z=7)\n\nhope ", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 37328, "year": "2018"}], "name": "mapphotography2018"}
