Prior to the shoot I did a LOT of research, and this sub has been a great help. \n\nI'm now here to return the favor. I am going to share my entire experience and also answer any questions you may have if you are curious about what I did. I'm obviously by no means a seasoned professional, but seeing as I just finished my first paid shoot, I wanted to give details while it's still fresh in my mind.\n\nSome background--I am a food/product photographer. I've always shot for fun, but last month I decided to turn it into a side gig. I started an IG account and started to tag all the restaurants I go to and taken their pictures at. I did not have a website or a portfolio, but my IG was a representation of my work.\n\nI approached a local brunch and catering spot about a week after I started my IG and asked if they were interested in meeting me to discuss shooting for their menu. They said yes. I IMMEDIATELY STARTED RESEARCHING.\n\nI had a lot of doubt about how much to charge, what I need to do, etc. I was very honest with her during my meeting and told her that I do not have any clients yet. After getting an idea of what she was looking for and what her budget is (always ask them what their budget is). She said her budget was limited and she was willing to pay in check/gift card. I told her I'd get back to her by the end of the day with a quote.\n\nNow, keep in mind...I have hardly any work to show for and I wanted to build my portfolio and gain experience and clientele. \n\nI quoted her the following: 2.5 hour shoot (2 hours during business time and 30 minutes at an evening catering event, because she wanted a couple of catered shots), 20-25 photos. My fee was $100 check and $100 in gift card. She accepted my offer.\n\nI've since finished the shoot, got paid (I got paid the day of the shoot) and I've delivered the photos. I ended up giving her 26 photos. Same day of the shoot, I gave her a couple of sneak peaks. That being said, here are my takeaways from this first shoot.\n\nPros:\n\n*She was amazing to work with and very easy going\n*She gave me complete creative freedom, I can shoot whatever I wanted.\n*Thank God for multiple SD cards and batteries. I shot about 400 shots in 2 hours.\n*I'm able to use a variety of shots in my portfolio\n\nCons:\n\n*She didn't have a shot list, so it was difficult to gauge what she may want\n*BIGGEST CON: Because the place is a small business, they can't shut down and make the food for me take shots of. I shot what was ordered by the guests and I had to shoot fast. I'm talking like 10-20 seconds to shoot it and then the waiter/waitress will take it to the customer. I think in the future, I will have to discuss this in advance in terms of what the restaurants are expecting in terms of quality. Now that being said, the pro of this is that she gave me the freedom to shoot whatever and however, so she's not looking for anything specific. \n*With that, I also could not touch the food or re-plate the food/style the food. So I shot it as it came out.\n\nOverall--I didn't get a variety of the dishes that I had hoped, because people ordered a lot of the same things. I am VERY happy with the result with the given situation (if I do say so myself). It was very challenging and time flew by because I was so busy.\n\nSo, that's my experience with my first paid gig.

I spend a lot of time (sometimes because these places changed quite a bit, I was looking for that [nice roof](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1WSVO1gz3s/) and couldn't figure out where it is :) ) walking around the city to find the places from old photos and try to match them as close as possible - angles, focal distance etc.\n\nAnd the best part about this - I'm not just taking photos of before/afters for this collection, while walking around the city I found a lot of great places and took some interesting photos.

First off I wanna say that I'm new here and I did see that there is an official questions thread, but after seeing some other questions and discussions posted to the main page I feel okay putting this here instead. I'd be happy to send it over to that thread if I need to.\n\nFor some background, I'm 19 years old and I've been interested in photography for about as long as I can remember. I'd like to think I'm more skilled than the average amateur. No, I don't have any social media directly showcasing my work, I don't really have a following or my own \"style,\" and sometimes I'll go for months without picking up my camera. ( Though a lot of that is for reasons outside of my control, which I'll explain in a bit.) I've dabbled in wildlife, landscapes, and a recent interest in urban exploration. I have a lot of head knowledge even if I can't always put it into practice with my limited equipment and opportunities. I'm plenty familiar with manual mode, lightroom, etc. Trouble is I feel like I've run out of things to do.\n\nSo today I made a sort of spur of the moment decision that I want to contact a local photographer (who I've never met or interacted with) and ask if I could tag along with her to gain some new experiences. I was hoping for some advice on what I should say when I initially contact her. I need a little input because I'm not great at meeting new people. I come on either too strong or too flat. I know that a simple rejection is the worst thing that could happen and that I've got nothing to lose, but I also want to increase my chances of getting the opportunity.\n\nShe does mostly wedding and senior portraits which I have absolutely no history with and that's why I want to pursue it. You see, one of the things that is out of my control is my controlling parents (that I still live with.) I was homeschooled and I don't really have any friends that I could practice with and I can't exactly \\*go\\* anywhere to explore new landscapes and interesting places. After seven years doing the same thing over and over again, I feel like my creativity is running dry. I've always wanted to be able to pick up my camera and head out with a group of friends and take photos for the fun of it- whether candid or directed. And I've never once been able to do that.\n\nTruth be told, it's really time that I get myself into gear and start thinking about my future anyway. I have a limited time left that I'll be able to live with my parents (long story.) I actually like my boring, entry level job but it'll be hard to make a living off of it. I haven't pursued college because of disapproving parents/no other support system. Besides, photography is the only route that's ever felt \"right\" for me. I think this sort of thing would be a great chance for me to explore what I can do and reinvigorate the love I know is still there. The excitement I felt upon purchasing my first dslr.\n\nSo like... What do I even say to her? The only relevant equipment I have is a canon rebel sl1 and its kit lens. I know it isn't much but at least it's something. I've really got no knowledge of lighting gear but I really tend to favor outdoor, naturally lit scenes anyway (which is mostly what this photographer does.) Some people are crazy good at shooting portraits outside in harsh light and it blows my mind- I wanna be able to do that. Should I mention my \"gear\" right away? I'll link her to my instagram page (the only social media platform I use) which is mostly photography but also a smattering of personal photos. Probably not very impressive (I'd be happy to share with anyone that's interested- shoot me a dm or leave a comment and I'll sent it your way. I'd rather not post it here.) Of course I'll offer to meet her in person first. I'm probably overthinking this but that's what I'm good at.\n\nThanks for the help!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/dje32q/im_an_amateur_and_i_want_shadow_a_professional/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "i'm an amateur and i want shadow a professional- hoping for some advice. /!/  \n\nhey everyone. first off i wanna say that i'm new here and i did see that there is an official questions thread, but after seeing some other questions and discussions posted to the main page i feel okay putting this here instead. i'd be happy to send it over to that thread if i need to.\n\nfor some background, i'm 19 years old and i've been interested in photography for about as long as i can remember. i'd like to think i'm more skilled than the average amateur. no, i don't have any social media directly showcasing my work, i don't really have a following or my own \"style,\" and sometimes i'll go for months without picking up my camera.

One of the pieces of advice I kept reading over and over was to just get Lightroom. I now think this is terrible advice for a lot of hobbyists. Worse, in a strange sort of Stockholm syndrome, contrary opinions are shouted down. With the recent price hike, I'm hoping there's now more appetite for discussion.\n\n***\n\n# Good reasons to get Lightroom\n\n* You're a professional and have to ingest, sort, and batch edit hundreds or thousands of photos every week. You need a professional level DAM.\n* You have invested into the system. You have spent considerable time and energy learning the workflow, such that the costs of switching are considerable. Your library and edits are locked into this system.\n* You're a beginner, you have the money, and you'd rather make learning easy. Most tutorials and workshops are in LR. (Note, however, that the skills are mostly pretty transferable across software.)\n* You think the software is so superior that it justifies its enormous price tag.\n\n***\n\n# Bad reasons to get Lightroom\n\n* **\"It's cheap! PS and LR used to cost $1000 and now it's a lot less.\"**\n\n Yes, Adobe products used to cost hundreds of dollars and now it's more affordable. In 2019 dollars, MS Word used to cost $800, the Netscape browser cost $80, the Atari 2600 cost almost $900, etc. As you can see, this is insane reasoning for any other software category. The historical price of Space Invaders isn't that relevant to judging game prices today. A lot of free software released now would be worth thousands in the past. We don't live in the past; we live in a world where you can buy a lot of high-quality Adobe alternatives for about $50 each.\n\n* **\"It's cheap! In a hobby where people spend hundreds on lenses, it's crazy people care about $10/$20 a month!\"**\n\n This is just a non-sequitur. I'd rather have $10/mo than not. And it's also a bit insensitive to the many aspiring photographers who are in poorer countries or who are just broke. The US dollar trades very highly against other currencies. Besides, monthly costs are misleading...\n\n* **\"It's cheap! It's only $10/$20 a month!\"**\n\n Cost-per-month thinking is often misleading and sometimes downright financially illiterate. It's what car dealerships use to trick you into buying cars you wouldn't normally buy. Instead, it makes more sense to compare the cost of LR over the lifetime use of other software, for example over 4 years. (If you think that's unfair, use 3 or 5 years or whatever.)\n\n\n**4-year cost**\n\n| LR/C1 @ $10/mo | LR @ $20/mo | Affinity | Luminar | Pixelmator pro | PhotoMechanic | ACDSee |\n|:--|:--|:--| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 480 | 960 | 50 | 70 | 40 | 140 | 60 |\n\n\n As you can see, LR is not just a little bit more expensive. It's insane. Not to mention the fact that most of the other software goes on sale frequently. I haven't even mentioned the open source stuff for free. Check out digikam, rawtherapee or darktable. These are somewhat worse in the UX department, but are often just as powerful.\n\n* **\"Some people can't afford the upfront cost of other software, but can afford a low monthly fee.\"**\n\n If you're just starting out, you can save up money for 5 or 6 months and use free trials of different software. Put the money away that you would've spent on LR. That way, by the end of 6 months, you have some idea of what to buy and the money to buy it.\n\n\n***\n\n# Living without the library management of LR for $0\n\nIf you're just starting out, or just shoot on weekends, or don't shoot hundreds of photos a week, then you don't need Lightroom. (You also don't need it if you're a pro, obviously, but it's more reasonable.) But if you're like me, library management is the main reason to be reluctant to leave LR. I want to offer a simple alternative way to manage your library. With all the money you save on subscriptions, you can move on to more advanced systems later if you want.\n\n## 1. Folder structure\n\nMake a folder system in your computer or external drive with the following hierarchy: Year, Month, Event\n\n&gt; photo library\n&gt;&gt; 2019 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 04 April\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Easter with kids\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beach picnic\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 05 May\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Photo walk May 23\n\nRandom photos that don't belong in an event can be put in a folder named with the day (e.g. \"May 12\" or \"05 12\" or \"12\") or just left loose in the month folder. If you take street photography everyday, you can also make a \"street photography\" folder to gather all those together for the month. Don't worry, if you ever want to see all your photos in chronological order instead of as events, digikam or any management software will let you do that.\n\n## 2. Rename photos\n\nYou can use [digikam](https://www.digikam.org), a free open-source library manager, to import and batch rename files. Select all the photos in a given folder and then go to the menu: Item&gt;Rename. \n\nDigikam will use the EXIF data (the meta-data stored in the photo) to rename the files. Here's one suggestion: [date:\"yyyy-MM-dd\"]\\_[dir]\\_###[e]\n\nThis will produce a file that looks like this: *2019-04-20_Beach Picnic_001*\n\nIn other words: the date, the name of the directory, and the number of the photo in the order it was taken. Add another \\# if you have more than 999 photos in a folder.\n\n## 3. Sort and edit\n\nYou can use digikam to delete and rate photos. (It's a bit slow at this on mac, but honestly it's a pretty complete system.) If you're not taking hundreds of photos at a time, you can also sort using your file manager. The other free alternative is Adobe Bridge. Honestly, I hate adobe for hijacking my system resources even when the software isn't in use, but I hear Bridge has an excellent UX.\n\n***\n\nThe good thing about this system is that there's no lock-in. You can get any management app in the future, if you want, and your file structure will be totally preserved. You're also free to edit your images using any editor, since your editor is independent from library management.\n\nI'm *not* saying everyone should follow my advice. LR is totally great for lots of people. My claim is that the blanket advice to just get LR is terrible for many hobbyists. Now that I quit, I regret the two years of subscription I paid ($240) and the fact that my edits are held ransom. As software continues to get cheaper, and Adobe paradoxically maintains or increases their crazy price, the math will keep getting worse and worse.\n\nA lot of you will also say that this has been talked about to death. I disagree. Once upon a time, I was a beginner looking at this sub and found very little in-depth discussion on Lightroom alternatives. [The sub wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index), though excellent, is also brief on the topic. I'm writing the post I wish I had read when I started.

This scam is targeting photographers who are small/new on instagram, desperate for engagement and may not know better, especially when an account looks legitimate.\n\nThere is a large landscape photography account on Instagram called @earthescope (100k followers) and they also have a 177k following on Twitter. They repost high-quality photos and I believe they do actually have a lot of legit followers and engagement (rather than fake shell bots), as well as people who tag #earthescope in the hopes of being featured.\n\nThe Earthescope account looks legit as a landscape repost account, but on the side they use shell accounts such as jeff\\_visuals\\_, matt\\_visuals\\_, antro\\_visuals, bertchris\\_visuals (and I'm sure more) to reach out to and specifically target photographers with low following (lets say under 500 followers, I don't know the exact number). They post something on their feed like \"Wow, great picture! Do follow @earthescope and use #earthescope to get featured\" or \"Great photo, follow #earthescope and DM us for feature!\".\n\nIf you DM them (I will note when they originally contacted me, they used their earthescope main account to solicit, but have since swapped to using shell \"name\\_visuals\" side accounts), they will offer to feature your post as a package on their story/feed/twitter for a price. For me this was $29, but I know others who got scammed paid $20. If you're a very new Instagram account that has perhaps dabbled a little with Instagram's built in promotions, you might have realized that $30 with Instagram's advertisements does not get you very far, so if you're interested in growing your presence on Instagram, this is where spending $30 to have a photo posted on a large account may seem like a fun thing to try, especially since if you check their feed, they DO (rarely) post photos from accounts with few followers (probably to make their scam appear legit).\n\nHere is where the due diligence fail comes in: they do ask you to pay PP Friends &amp; Family (obvious scam warning), BUT, you are new to this (since they specifically target small accounts) AND if you look at their feed, they DO very occasionally feature small accounts in either their story or feed, so you think perhaps this is normal when dealing with a large feature account. Also I did search \"earthescope scam\" before I paid and could not find any red flags at the time, though I imagine that anyone who has been scammed and posted publicly on their feed has their comment deleted/blocked so there is no good place to even warn future victims who may be trying to do their due diligence.\n\nAnyway, earthescope takes your money, then they stop responding and obviously never do a feature post for most people.  I will note they do things like post a story only to pacify you and never post the standalone post they promised, but for the most part they take the money and cease communications.  There is no good way to report this sort of scam to Instagram, and there are no grounds for getting the money back in Paypal. $30 is not a lot to some, so many victims just give up and continue to let earthescope operate their scam and grow their Instagram presence by reposting popular photographers while scamming new accounts for $30 a pop.  I know there are redditors (I have seen some of earthescope's photos posted by the original photographers on reddit, though perhaps in [/r/earthporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn)) who's photos are getting reposted by earthescope and are inadvertently helping to perpetuate this scam. \n\nI am in contact with at least 3 other Instagram users others who have been scammed that I found in the past day, I'm sure there are more.
