Don't quote me on the propriety of that last description.  \n\nAt any rate, I wanted to give a PSA here for photographers and related artists concerning contracts, boundaries, etc. Not everyone will need all of the below, but I think it's useful general advice. It's a great deal of my own experience, combined with some Dave Ramsey, combined with some of the things I've read on here.\n\nFirst, always have a written contract, whether electronic or paper. Adage: *Good fences make good neighbors.* Well, good contracts make good business. Always? No. But nothing at all is ever \"always,\" except perhaps Murphy's Law of Photography: If you don't have a contract, the things that go wrong will be directly related to the lack of contract.\n\nThe things a written contract should cover include:\n\n1. Your business' official name (\"Jay's Photography\"), official address, the client's (or clients') name, the client's official address, point-of-contact, etc. An indication that the contract cannot be modified except by express, written, changes from the official POC. \n2. An indication of how you will charge for any given matter (by time, flat fee, editing, etc.), when payment is due, etc.\n3. *What will be done, and when.* You are a photographer - you want others to appreciate your work, and will have a tendency to bend to make someone feel special or fufilled. However, it is *neither cutthroat nor mean* to define upfront the nature of the work, such as when, where, who, etc., and *stick to that absent a change placed in writing.* \n4. An indication of the ownership of the electronic and printed materials. Is the person to own the images outright, will they own only the prints they order, will they decide on the top 50 images for the flat fee, etc. Consider here also whether you need a release to use any X number of images on your website, whether you will give the person free X images in exchange for the use of images for advertising, etc.\n5. The timeline regarding returning edited images or prints to the client.\n6. Disclaimer of any liability for things beyond your control, for equipment failure, or failure of the client to meet requirements.\n7. Definitions of breach of contract due to failure to pay or failure to keep the reservation. \n8. Expenses expected, to be incurred, and a \"incidental\" clause.\n9. State in which any matter to be resolved, particularly if working outside the state.\n10. State's law to be used in interpretation (such as \"State of Indiana\").\n11. A non-waiver clause.\n\nSecond, related to the contract, do *not change anything in it willy-nilly*. Meaning, if the bride calls and asks you to arrive 1/2 hour early on the day of, tell her you're going to send her an email with the additional time charges, and then DO send her an email that states, in part, something like, \"If you fail to object by one hour before the arrival time, the charge for the extra 1/2 hour of photography is X.\"\n\nThird, and relatedly, do not go \"off the cuff\" and waive agreed things. If you agreed to do four hours photos for X price, do not drop the price to Y when requested to do so. It opens you up to disagreements as to what was agreed to and when.  If it's a friend and you get a \"come on, now\" thing, tell them you will discuss at a later date, but cannot agree in the spur of the moment to change the amount. Later on, you can gift part of the cost if you want, but that should be a *separate matter*, not part of the contract. \n\nIn order words, don't do anything not covered in writing. Contingencies arise, yes, which may sometimes require off the cuff changes. But if you do that, recognize that you've open a door to all sorts of \"he said / she said\" issues which may eventually come back to bite you. *Hold the line.*\n\nFinally, remember that it is not bad to have a written contract. If people are uncomfortable with having things in writing, you have to consider whether you will work with them at all. Remember that some shoots (e.g., weddings) have at least 5,000 involved in decision making. If you don't get it in writing, someone will make changes, then someone else will make changes (saying they worked with the first person), and then someone else will contradict.\n\nMy two cents.
