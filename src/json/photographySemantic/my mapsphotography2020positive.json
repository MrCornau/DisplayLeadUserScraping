I'm sure that this is an oft-discussed issue - I worry that this is the equivalent to starting an oil thread on a motorcycle forum... But I also think that I can't be the only person stuck on this.\n\nFor context, I'm strictly a hobby photographer, and will stay that way. All of the photos I take and share are related to friends &amp; family, or my hobbies.\n\nI use Backblaze for online backup of my raw images, Lightroom catalog, and exported post-processed images, so this isn't really about backup. I also use a combination of Google Photos, Flickr, and Facebook to share those post-processed images. It basically breaks down to: Facebook for sharing stuff of my family &amp; friends where it's appropriate; Google Photos to share stuff with very specific people (like photos of my kids with friends' kids on a playdate - I'll send an album link to a Google Photos album to the parents but not post their kids on FB); and Flickr for hobby-related stuff that I want to easily share on online forums (I like the BBCode and multiple-sizes support built in to Flickr).\n\nBut I'd like to have a single point of access for review and sharing of everything I've completed processing &amp; exported.\n\nWhat I'd really like to do seems simple:\n\n1. Automatically upload everything in my top-level Exports folder to online storage that's accessible by Web and mobile app. By default those photos should not be visible to the public. Google Backup &amp; Sync and the Flickr Uploadr both do this (although I've had infuriating unexplained failures with Flickr Uploadr).\n2. Maintain the information from the folder structure within that Exports folder (like tags or albums). Flickr does this, Google Photos (amazingly) does not.\n3. Integrate with Chromecast and Apple TV for showing photos from a given album or tag in a slideshow *from my Android device*. Google Photos works very well with Chromecast, and apparently has some absolute shit screen mirroring support for Apple TV. Flickr just ignores this basic feature, it's been languishing on a wishlist for years now. Chromecast is more important than Apple TV, because that's what my Mom and I both use, but my godson's parents use Apple TV, so it would be nice to have a solution for that, too.\n\nI don't mind paying for a solution to this. It is absolutely shocking to me that Google just totally discards the folder info when uploading, and equally surprising that Flickr can't cast slideshows. These three requirements seem so basic as to be effectively universal.\n\nHunting around a bit, I found that SmugMug has the notion of folders, and the 3rd-party PicBackMan will do auto-upload to SmugMug (and other services) and preserve the folder structure from the source, and make those backed-up folders private by default. So, that covers items 1 and 2. I'm not clear about 3. My attempts to find out about the features of the SmugMug Android app have been kind of depressing.\n\nCan the SmugMug Android app cast to a Chromecast device? Can it make a slideshow from a selected folder? If so, that might be my choice.\n\nDoes anyone have an automated solution that covers the above 3 requirements?
