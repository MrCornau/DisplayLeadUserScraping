We've been around since 2006, but registered 501c3 since 2009.  We are the original organization to do such a program and as far as I know, are the only 501c3 like us to have our by-laws, forms, everything reviewed by the DoD (in 2009).  OpLove (for short) is a network of professional photographers that support military families during deployments and upon homecomings thru photography.  We capture their sweet welcome homes at the site of arrival, tears, and hugs at their departure or before their deployment.  The organization then prints the images for the clients and sends them overseas free of charge for morale boosting.  If the session was a homecoming, we give the client 15 digital files to download.\n\nOur organization also offers a yearly scholarship and we have a program that supports fallen military with printed canvases immediately shipped to the service/memorial sites called the Sgt. Soto Memorial Fund.\n\nI, myself, am a military spouse and have been shooting professionally since 2005, even thru 3 cross country moves.\n\nWe are REALLY in need of supporting photographers.  In 2009 we had 2000 photographers worldwide.  We are down to 33 active.  Our organization and members have donated over $2million dollars worth of services and prints with the help of our sponsoring lab H&amp;H Color.  We hope to open our services up to DoD Civilians and Retired Veterans this year and eventually would like to support 1st responders.  \n\nI cannot do this until we have more support for our current photographers.  Most are turning away sessions because they are already booked and they need help covering families going thru deployments.  Photographers are able to upsell to their clients after the OpLove obligation has been met, and many of the clients come back to them later for additional services.\n\nIf you are a photographer of any level and want to give back to people who give us everything, please consider joining OpLove or telling your photographer friends!  We request a $25 yearly membership due to help pay for the printing and operational needs of the organization which is a tax write-off.  Photographers are also able to write-off their OpLove specific service/session fees as a donation.  Photographers are placed on a networked map.  We print for you, ship for you, host for you...

I do travel a lot in Japan, there are thousands of spots I have visited and thousands more I didn't, but plan to. Those spots are very different in style, and my visits totally depend on the season.

I was only made for myself though, a bit too quickly, wasn't working nicely on mobile, so recently I decided to work on something much better and more modern that could appeal to more users. That's how Ikuzo was born. It's here: [https://ikuzo.app](https://ikuzo.app). It's totally free for now, but I will need to figure this out at some later point as the infrastructure costs me quite some money every month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not coming here to find clients; I prefer to give free accounts (and currently, you can do that, even without asking me) and discuss this solution, and others.

I would love to work with many of you and make it like a great tool for everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not hesitate to contact me here, and also, I think it would be interesting to know what your current solutions are, and how you handle all your photography spots on a daily basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/aef6s9/how_to_createmanage_ones_own_private_spots_map/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "google maps", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "how to create/manage one's own private spots map for photography and travels? /!/ hello everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni am coming with this question because i am really interested in the answers, but also because i came with my own. i have been using -----> google !!!  -----> maps !!!  (and -----> google !!!  my -----> maps !!! ) for years, but it has too many shortcomings. i do travel a lot in japan, there are thousands of spots i have visited and thousands more i didn't, but plan to. those spots are very different in style, and my visits totally depend on the season. the number of spots i have is so overwhelming that i can't possibly take a few days to plan all my next trips for the year; i need a map system that gives me what i am (might) be looking for at any time.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nto help myself, i created a map editor system based on wordpress a few years ago, and photography friends also got interested and started using it. i was only made for myself though, a bit too quickly, wasn't working nicely on mobile, so recently i decided to work on something much better and more modern that could appeal to more users. that's how ikuzo was born. it's here: [https://ikuzo.app](https://ikuzo.app). it's totally free for now, but i will need to figure this out at some later point as the infrastructure costs me quite some money every month.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni am not coming here to find clients; i prefer to give free accounts (and currently, you can do that, even without asking me) and discuss this solution, and others. of course, i would really love to have your feedback, and how this could be even more useful to you as photographers. i would love to work with many of you and make it like a great tool for everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ndo not hesitate to contact me here, and also, i think it would be interesting to know what your current solutions are, and how you handle all your photography spots on a daily basis.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthanks for reading :)", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 82720, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 336995, "autor": "Tweetystraw", "date": 1561236387000, "content": "Shooting full moon/Supermoon shots /!/ I shoot full moon and super moon rises as a hobby, and wanted to pass along a couple of techniques.
