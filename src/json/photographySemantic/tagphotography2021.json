But I also want to protect my privacy. If you send photos by email, they are permanently stored on mail servers except if you delete your mail and ask your friends to also delete the mail after viewing the photos. This is not possible, and sharing on cloud, I don't trust the provider ! And I don't want my friends to post my photos on social networks.\n\nSo I decided to develop a mobile application for sharing photos. \n\nThat is said, I would like to present you a new exciting application I have developed to let users share their photos and videos without storing them on a any cloud server.\n\nSharing is secure and end-to-end encrypted between mobile terminals, and is done only from device to device (P2P) without any intermediate server. Only your friends have a copy of your photos and videos, but they cannot access them to save elsewhere (screenshot is also disabled). \n\nYou can install the application on Google Play\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orange.labs.poltreder\n\nThanks for your comments or any issue report.\n\nAll the functionalities in detail:\n\u2022 Poltreder lets you manage and share all the photos and videos available in the library of your mobile device (i.e. taken with the mobile camera).\n\u2022 Organize your photos and videos into collections. A collection is a simple tag (see it as a folder) to group your photos and videos. You can then share the collection with your friends. This allows you to control who can view which photos or videos of your camera library.\n\u2022 Your photos and videos are not saved in any cloud server, but directly transferred towards the devices of your friends. Sharing with Poltreder is fully secure and encrypted.\n\u2022 Whenever you delete a photo or video from a collection, it still exists in your device, but it is automatically removed from the devices of your friends. Similarly, when deleting photos and videos permanently from your device library, they are also removed from any collection which contains them, and mostly, as well as from the devices of your friends with whom you have shared them.\n\u2022 If you decide to remove a friend from accessing a collection, the collection (incl. all the photos and videos) will be also deleted from your friend's device.\n\u2022 If you delete a friend, all the collections, including photos and videos, you shared with your friend will be removed from his/her device, and in turn, all the photos and videos shared by your friend will be also removed from your device.\n\u2022 No need to create an account to use Poltreder. We just ask you to choose a username and an avatar: this only allows your friends to identify you easily! Account creation is done locally on your device using a process of invitations by email to link accounts between them for sharing photos and videos.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/pyudgg/android_application_to_securely_share_your_photos/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "android application to securely share your photos and videos with your friends without storing on any intermediate server. /!/ hello,\n\ni love taking photos with my mobile, then proudly share the most beautiful photos with my friends or family. but i also want to protect my privacy. if you send photos by email, they are permanently stored on mail servers except if you delete your mail and ask your friends to also delete the mail after viewing the photos. this is not possible, and sharing on cloud, i don't trust the provider ! and i don't want my friends to post my photos on social networks.\n\nso i decided to develop a mobile application for sharing photos. \n\nthat is said, i would like to present you a new exciting application i have developed to let users share their photos and videos without storing them on a any cloud server.\n\nsharing is secure and end-to-end encrypted between mobile terminals, and is done only from device to device (p2p) without any intermediate server. only your friends have a copy of your photos and videos, but they cannot access them to save elsewhere (screenshot is also disabled). \n\nyou can install the application on google play\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orange.labs.poltreder\n\nthanks for your comments or any issue report.\n\nall the functionalities in detail:\n\u2022 poltreder lets you manage and share all the photos and videos available in the library of your mobile device (i.e. taken with the mobile camera).\n\u2022 organize your photos and videos into collections. a collection is a simple -----> tag !!!

If so, does that mean I should also use RGB for everything so I know my images will match what most people are seeing?

I even have one rider, that also owns a rental business, looking to purchase commercial licenses for some of them, which obviously I'm charging a premium for.\n\nI guess my point is that every opportunity I've ever gotten in my professional photo career has been because I took the initiative and made them happen. My main photo gig came about when I reached out to the head photographer and asked to tag along, not even knowing beforehand that he was looking for new people to hire.
