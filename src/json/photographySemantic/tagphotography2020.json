One main reason is, sadly, that photography communities get really toxic. Especially during specs talks, when those who consider cameras as just a pure \u201cstill\u201d photography tool, and look down upon people who want \u201cgimmicks\u201d like videos. Or towards \u201c*less worthy*\u201d smartphones snappers.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to have this behavior in a videogame forum, because of the age range, But IMO, older photographers should behave more respectfully and welcome anyone to enjoy the \u201cart\u201d of photography, including advances and change in usage and new trends.\n\nIMO, a person \u201csnapping\u201d tons of photos on their phone doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a genuine love for photography, and that some of their shots aren\u2019t taken with great care and love that any photographer would do.\n\nSo instead of shunning them, why not be more welcoming and teaching techniques. After all, the known mantra is \u201cgear doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, no?\n\n.\n\nAnyway, I am using the recent announce of the Canon R5/6, with some arguments that I see repeated every camera generation in the past years, to provide some counter arguments:\n\n1. \u201c**I don\u2019t use X feature, so no one should need it**\u201d\n\nWhen people complain about the lack of a certain feature, it means the camera isn\u2019t good enough to answer for their needs, as in, it won\u2019t sell as good.\n\nIf sales are low, companies have less money to invest in next versions and enhance their R&amp;D, leading to outdated specs, or the company going bankrupt completely (here in Japan, most old companies and camera shops completely disappeared, even Canon/Nikon are in the red, and rumored to not withstand couple other years before leaving the photo business and focus on other fields like the medical one).\n\nSo please, be open minded that other people\u2019s needs, that if answered, not only won\u2019t harm you, but would make everyone happy when sales follow.\n\n2. \u201c**Who needs video? This is a still camera**\u201d\n\nThis comes back often. And the answer is simple: Since smartphones came to the market, DSLR lost more than 86% of their market (2009~2019), while compacts lost nearly 90%. Meanwhile, the smartphones audience increased tremendously, with the feature number one being the camera in both photo and video mode. At the same time, vLogging and photos/videos apps exploded in popularity. We\u2019ve even seen a new market for action cameras.\n\nSo, I guess there are people who need videos, and, outside of those choosing low budget phones, they might have been on DSLR if companies understood user needs and did better marketing.\n\n3. \u201c**4K uncropped/8K/better codecs/etc.?, A camera is made for stills, buy the cinema version if you want better videos**\u201d\n\nI understand that for some people just being able to shoot photos is enough, the same as for some people phones should just be able to do call. But times change, technology advances and people\u2019s need evolve.\n\nFirst, the audience for a non-studio, professional video camera is extremely small. It\u2019s too expensive for even serious enthusiasts, and it\u2019s too underwhelming for large studios who need a support for all the production pipeline.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t make sense to \u201cprotect\u201d a small audience cinema line by making a potentially larger selling camera unattractive.\n\nSecond, we shouldn\u2019t ignore the market these cameras are competing in: for years, almost all sub 500$ smartphones shoot stabilized 4K 60p in HDR without any major problem, while taking excellent photos, especially when we include the new **computational photography** to enhance quality, resolution and even some effects (portrait modes, etc).\n\nWe also have the new action cameras, that for 500$ish price tag offer video capture in 360\u00b0 stabilized 4K+ at high framerate and extreme weather.\n\nSo, when we have a new generation of flagship DSLR, lasting few years before the next upgrade, that\u2019s over 3000$ body only ... people are (IMHO) entitled to at least criticize the lack of these, especially for a device that does only photos/videos, and that should be future proof as people aren\u2019t changing cameras yearly.\n\n4. \u201c**Bluetooth, GPS, etc. are just gimmicks, no use to be present on a camera**\u201d\n\nAgain, if we see the market the cameras are competing against, smartphones offer the extreme high advantage of **connectivity**, and being able to edit photos and share them **instantly** with everyone (over the internet, or just wirelessly in a social setting).\n\nCameras, while they\u2019re maybe not ergonomic to embed, say, an Android OS, with apps on camera. They should at least have enough connectivity to share quickly with multiple devices.\n\nJust looking at action cameras, power banks, people with multiple phones, etc. some people would be willing to transport multiple devices, even buying a cheaper phone and a good camera if the workflow was better.\n\n.\n\nThese are the major points I wanted to address without my post becoming a rant article. Please share your thoughts.\n\nTo summarize, the points of view I\u2019d like some people to consider are:\n\n- Don\u2019t forget the market the cameras are competing against when you see rants. If the price tag is multiple times other platforms, specs should follow or even be better.\n\n- Other users aren\u2019t the enemy. In fact, if more people are satisfied and come back to the camera market, it will survive and thrive.

this is a still camera**\u201d\n\nthis comes back often. and the answer is simple: since smartphones came to the market, dslr lost more than 86% of their market (2009~2019), while compacts lost nearly 90%. meanwhile, the smartphones audience increased tremendously, with the feature number one being the camera in both photo and video mode. at the same time, vlogging and photos/videos apps exploded in popularity. we\u2019ve even seen a new market for action cameras.\n\nso, i guess there are people who need videos, and, outside of those choosing low budget phones, they might have been on dslr if companies understood user needs and did better marketing.\n\n3. \u201c**4k uncropped/8k/better codecs/etc.?, a camera is made for stills, buy the cinema version if you want better videos**\u201d\n\ni understand that for some people just being able to shoot photos is enough, the same as for some people phones should just be able to do call. but times change, technology advances and people\u2019s need evolve.\n\nfirst, the audience for a non-studio, professional video camera is extremely small. it\u2019s too expensive for even serious enthusiasts, and it\u2019s too underwhelming for large studios who need a support for all the production pipeline.\n\nso it doesn\u2019t make sense to \u201cprotect\u201d a small audience cinema line by making a potentially larger selling camera unattractive.\n\nsecond, we shouldn\u2019t ignore the market these cameras are competing in: for years, almost all sub 500$ smartphones shoot stabilized 4k 60p in hdr without any major problem, while taking excellent photos, especially when we include the new **computational photography** to enhance quality, resolution and even some effects (portrait modes, etc).\n\nwe also have the new action cameras, that for 500$ish price -----> tag !!!  offer video capture in 360\u00b0 stabilized 4k+ at high framerate and extreme weather.\n\nso, when we have a new generation of flagship dslr, lasting few years before the next upgrade, that\u2019s over 3000$ body only ... people are (imho) entitled to at least criticize the lack of these, especially for a device that does only photos/videos, and that should be future proof as people aren\u2019t changing cameras yearly.\n\n4. \u201c**bluetooth, gps, etc. are just gimmicks, no use to be present on a camera**\u201d\n\nagain, if we see the market the cameras are competing against, smartphones offer the extreme high advantage of **connectivity**, and being able to edit photos and share them **instantly** with everyone (over the internet, or just wirelessly in a social setting).\n\ncameras, while they\u2019re maybe not ergonomic to embed, say, an android os, with apps on camera. they should at least have enough connectivity to share quickly with multiple devices.\n\njust looking at action cameras, power banks, people with multiple phones, etc. some people would be willing to transport multiple devices, even buying a cheaper phone and a good camera if the workflow was better.\n\n.\n\nthese are the major points i wanted to address without my post becoming a rant article. please share your thoughts.\n\nto summarize, the points of view i\u2019d like some people to consider are:\n\n- don\u2019t forget the market the cameras are competing against when you see rants. if the price tag is multiple times other platforms, specs should follow or even be better.\n\n- other users aren\u2019t the enemy. in fact, if more people are satisfied and come back to the camera market, it will survive and thrive. else, it will be doomed and disappear soon.\n\n- let\u2019s not berate and demean people who don\u2019t use specific gear by classifying them as less worthy. all the younger generation starts with smartphones nowadays, and they\u2019ll move to cameras when they reach the limit of their gear. but they\u2019ll be alienated if faced with toxicity and demeaning.\n\nthank you for reading, and sorry for the long text.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 70171, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 69046, "autor": "ThatsYourHomeBall", "date": 1594112421000, "content": "Is there anything as good as Google Photos Facial Recognition AI to replace it with?

Databases\n\nI don't like databases in such software very much, when they are storing the results of the workflow and can be corrupted. RawTherapy is based on sidecar files, which I prefer. Anyway, Capture One and Darktable are based on file based databases. When someone wants to store raw images and the results on a NAS, he has to live with it. \n\nPart of the idea for my project was to store the database file on the NAS, which isn't that easy. \n\n### 2. Speed comparison while working on an image\n\nBoth software packages are using OpenCL so that graphics card are accelerating the processing. I have two NVidia 1080ti in my system. My guess is, neither Darktable nor Capture One is using both of them. \n\nI don't care that much about the processing time when exporting images for presentation, but I care about the processing speed when working on images. \n\nHere was Darktable the clear winner. The images of the Z7 with uncompressed pixel data are quite large and it took Capture One 1s-3s before the image became visible again after a zoom or a new processing step. Darktable need less than one second. My guess is something between 0.2s to 0.5s\n\nThe import of images in Darktable is faster as well, but this not of importance to me. \n\nThe result is dependent on OpenCL and I didn't care about CPU only processing. \n\n### 3. Processing\n\nDarktable is basically made for a workflow without any presets. My settings give an initially flat image. Capture One puts out an saturated image when loading the image the first time. \n\nCapture One's  processing tools are easy to use and focused on color manipulation and there are no doubts, it makes a fast workflow possible. Darktable's features are more focused on a lot of professional tools which are partially redundant, to suit the needs of different photographers. The Filmic tool to compress dynamics of an image for web or print is really great. Darktable has it all, but demands a lot of work to get used to the masses of tools. The results are comparable, but Capture One is clearly easier to handle in the first days. \n\n### 4. Masking\n\nHere is where Darktable is glorious. While Capture one is based on a pixel based mask, Darktable is offering parametric and drawn masks for channels. A parametric mask makes it much easier to get a good mask for sky or water in just seconds. \n\nWhile Capture One is offering layers to combine various masks, Darktable is working with tool instances, which means a tool like Contrast has to be instantiated by clicking a button and then used with a new mask.  In the history the new instantiated tool becomes a new name. Both layering workflows are quite comparable. \n\nBoth software packages have blending modifiers. \n\n### 5. Denoising\n\nCapture One denoising tool is similar to that of Lightroom. It's easy to use. When wrong used halos or washed out details are included. \n\nThe same can be said about Darktable, but Darktable has profiled denoising (camera dependent denoising) which delivers almost perfect results with out changing too much. Halos or washed out details are not that easy to achieve. I prefer Darktables denoising. \n\n### 6. Lens correction\n\nThose who are buying brand new lenses can't use Darktable or they have to provide images for the developement of lens parameters in the lensfun library. It takes up to 1 one year before a lens is arriving in Darktable via lenfun. I don't have the buildings to provide such images and had to wait over 6 months before the 24mm-70mm/2.8 Z mount lens arrived in Darktable. \n\nOther than that, the lens correction is working very well, even with older lenses like the 180mm/2.8 F mount lens, with a lot of chromatic aberations. \n\n### 7. Storing Workflow Parameters\n\nDarktable as well as Capture One is storing history in a database as well in a sidecar file, which is quite important in the case the database is getting lost. Both software packages store the database in a more ore less hidden space.\n\n### 8. Tagging\n\nDarktable is providing hierarchical tagging. So it's possible to tag an image with Location-&gt;City-&gt;London. \n\n### 9. Choice\n\nMy favorite became Darktable because of the processing speed in the workflow. Here is Capture One in a disadvantage.\n\n### 10. Storing images on a NAS\n\nI build myself a NAS (64GB ram, Ryzen CPU) with a ZFS Z2 raid and 10Gb Ethernet network on the base of Open Media Vault, which is based on Debian. My choice for such a solution was driven by being able to run docker containers with load. Since I'm used to work with Debian systems, I don't wanted FreeNas which is BSD based. \n\nThe used database engine is SQLITE, which is on the network quite dependent on the used file system. Using the usual SMB (Windows) based file sharing isn't working well over network for the database. I had to use NFS. Open Media Vault makes it quite easy configure shares. I moved images as well as the database to the NAS and replaced the files and directories with softlinks pointing to the NAS. This allows to change the NAS while the stored paths in the database are remaining the same. \n\nAnother way to solve the problem of changing paths to an image directory is simply to change a row in the database, with a Firefox addon. It was my solution to adapt to a changed image directory. \n\nThe raid system is a lot faster than a SATA SSD with 600mb/s and even the access of the database on the NAS doesn't delay the system. Importing images is faster than ever. I need for the import of of 30 images on the light table not more than 1s. \n\nMy UPS was connected to the NAS . In the case of a power outage  the system is powering down automatically. \n\n### 11. Caveats\n\n- I'm using Linux on my personal PC because it's faster. But using Windows shouldn't be a problem as well. But in any case mounting the shares of the NAS statically into the PC can be a challenge for some. \n\n- A NAS is not a backup and backup is expensive\n\n- A UPS is needed otherwise ZFS is going to be destroyed when a power outage occurs. \n\n- My case for the NAS is not that good. There is nothing on the market supporting cooling of hard disks with low noise fans. I had to close ventilation holes with tape to force air over the hard disks. If you have a special room for a noisy server get one from EBay. The 8 hard disks are producing more than 100W of heat, which is quite a heating source for my room. \n\n### 12. Conclusion \n\nI'm quite satisfied with the solution especially Darktable. The speed is fantastic. I've never experience such a fast system before. \n\nA substitution of the NAS with a NVME SSD is possible, but image data hase to be stored somewhere and I produced this summer over 150GB of raw image data. The NVME solution is not cheaper. \n\nA graphics card with 6GB RAM should be sufficient to accelerate Darktable.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/hzx51b/using_darktable_to_develop_nikon_z7_raw_images/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "tagging", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "using darktable to develop nikon z7 raw images stored on a nas with 10gb network /!/ this is a relative short documentation on the search whether to use capture one or darktable on nas stored raw images of a z7\n\nthe question of using capture one or using darktable is not that easy since both software packages have focus on different features and are both are using a database. \n\n### 1. databases\n\ni don't like databases in such software very much, when they are storing the results of the workflow and can be corrupted. rawtherapy is based on sidecar files, which i prefer. anyway, capture one and darktable are based on file based databases. when someone wants to store raw images and the results on a nas, he has to live with it. \n\npart of the idea for my project was to store the database file on the nas, which isn't that easy. \n\n### 2. speed comparison while working on an image\n\nboth software packages are using opencl so that graphics card are accelerating the processing. i have two nvidia 1080ti in my system. my guess is, neither darktable nor capture one is using both of them. \n\ni don't care that much about the processing time when exporting images for presentation, but i care about the processing speed when working on images. \n\nhere was darktable the clear winner. the images of the z7 with uncompressed pixel data are quite large and it took capture one 1s-3s before the image became visible again after a zoom or a new processing step. darktable need less than one second. my guess is something between 0.2s to 0.5s\n\nthe import of images in darktable is faster as well, but this not of importance to me. \n\nthe result is dependent on opencl and i didn't care about cpu only processing. \n\n### 3. processing\n\ndarktable is basically made for a workflow without any presets. my settings give an initially flat image. capture one puts out an saturated image when loading the image the first time. \n\ncapture one's  processing tools are easy to use and focused on color manipulation and there are no doubts, it makes a fast workflow possible. darktable's features are more focused on a lot of professional tools which are partially redundant, to suit the needs of different photographers. the filmic tool to compress dynamics of an image for web or print is really great. darktable has it all, but demands a lot of work to get used to the masses of tools. the results are comparable, but capture one is clearly easier to handle in the first days. \n\n### 4. masking\n\nhere is where darktable is glorious. while capture one is based on a pixel based mask, darktable is offering parametric and drawn masks for channels. a parametric mask makes it much easier to get a good mask for sky or water in just seconds. \n\nwhile capture one is offering layers to combine various masks, darktable is working with tool instances, which means a tool like contrast has to be instantiated by clicking a button and then used with a new mask.  in the history the new instantiated tool becomes a new name. both layering workflows are quite comparable. \n\nboth software packages have blending modifiers. \n\n### 5. denoising\n\ncapture one denoising tool is similar to that of lightroom. it's easy to use. when wrong used halos or washed out details are included. \n\nthe same can be said about darktable, but darktable has profiled denoising (camera dependent denoising) which delivers almost perfect results with out changing too much. halos or washed out details are not that easy to achieve. i prefer darktables denoising. \n\n### 6. lens correction\n\nthose who are buying brand new lenses can't use darktable or they have to provide images for the developement of lens parameters in the lensfun library. it takes up to 1 one year before a lens is arriving in darktable via lenfun. i don't have the buildings to provide such images and had to wait over 6 months before the 24mm-70mm/2.8 z mount lens arrived in darktable. \n\nother than that, the lens correction is working very well, even with older lenses like the 180mm/2.8 f mount lens, with a lot of chromatic aberations. \n\n### 7. storing workflow parameters\n\ndarktable as well as capture one is storing history in a database as well in a sidecar file, which is quite important in the case the database is getting lost. both software packages store the database in a more ore less hidden space.\n\n### 8. -----> tagging !!!

It has been going pretty well and I've been so happy to see my work get appreciated so much! Earlier today, I got an offer from a page that wanted to collaborate with me. I take quite a lot of photos of my dog, because she's really cute and I can use her as a model whenever, and a brand that makes clothes and accessories for dogs wanted to collaborate with me. The idea was to send me a free item from their store, for me to take a photo of my dog playing wifh it/ wearing it and they'd post it on their page and on their site, crediting me. I'd also get an affiliate link that offers my fans a good discount code (35%) and I get 10% of any purchase using that code.\n\nThat all sounded amazing, until they told me more.

This is a guide I wrote to analog feature accounts on Instagram. I know there are a lot of useless hashtags out there, and I wanted to highlight some feature accounts that might be a good start for film photographers who are interesting in finding inspiring work and sharing their own with the IG community. \n\nThis list is in no way meant to be exhaustive, as that would be impossible, but for those of you who are starting out with film photography and wondering how to share your work, there are a number of accounts that have their own hashtags, and mostly feature photos that are tagged with those hashtags. There are so many of these accounts that it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell them apart, so part of why I wanted to write this is to help demystify their differences.\n\nSome of these accounts are legitimate print outlets, though some of them just exist on Instagram. Some of them \u2013 particularly the larger accounts \u2013 may not rely on hashtags for discovering work at all, even though it seems like they do. Your mileage may vary, and to be honest, it\u2019s sometimes a popularity contest, especially with accounts that have more than 200k followers. But other photographers may follow these hashtags and discover your work as a result.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of crossover with these accounts. You\u2019ll see certain photos and photographers that are featured on multiple accounts, which is I guess the film photography version of going viral. You know the kind of photos I\u2019m talking about \u2013 the kind that are peppered throughout Instagram\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section, or the ones that hit the top of [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/). The kind that win contests. The ones that make you wish that you too were a master of nailing exposure and stumbling across (or creating) scenes that take your breath away.\n\nAnyways, here\u2019s a rough guide to curated feature accounts, sorted by the size of their follower-base. Instagram pages are linked. As a disclaimer, I think that curation is more important than popularity, and some of the smaller ones are run by people who are more involved in the analog community. Most of them are focused on film photography, but they\u2019re not all exclusively analog. Some featured photos just have a film \u201cvibe\u201d or aesthetic, which may annoy some people here. Lastly, these are just my opinions. This is a subjective guide. I'm not an expert -- I'm just a fan.\n\nOne thing I want to say is that you should **NEVER PAY FOR FEATURES**. I know it's tempting, everybody wants to get their work seen, but these accounts are popular because of other people's work. If anything, they should pay YOU for the use of your photography. I haven't mentioned certain accounts here because of this.\n\nAnyways...\n\n**\\~ \\~ A LIST OF FILM PHOTOGRAPHY FEATURE ACCOUNTS \\~ \\~**\n\n[**Somewhere Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/somewheremagazine/) **(#somewheremagazine) (861k followers)**\n\nSomewhere Magazine is one of the larger accounts out there. There\u2019s a nice mixture of cinematic scenes and more abstract lens-based art on this page, and it lives up to its claim of being a \u201cmood board\u201d.\n\n[**Film Wave**](https://www.instagram.com/film.wave/) **(#filmwave) (275k)**\n\nThis account has a tendency to post photos that are in some ways related to the act of analog photography in a meta kind of way. You\u2019ll find analog self portraits, photos of cameras, etc. on here. There\u2019s obviously more to their curation than that, as it is a large account with a large fanbase, but if you have a beautifully shot gear pic, this might be the account for you to tag.\n\n[**Nowhere Diary**](https://www.instagram.com/nowherediary/) **(#nowherediary) (257k)**\n\nLots of night scenes and foggy, moody photography. Lots of beautiful, empty scenes with no people in them, though some photos do feature people. What I like about this account is their tendency to pair some of their posts with lengthy written blurbs about photography. They have a series of Nowhere Diary Legend posts where they introduce their audience to famous photographers, which is a cool way to find out about significant photographers if you\u2019re new to photography and/or less plugged in to the historical side of things.\n\n[**Film Photographic**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotographic/) **(#filmphotographic) (204k)**\n\nOne of the founders and curators is Jason Lee, which is cool. Also a gallery and book publisher. There\u2019s an emphasis on more rural scenes here and landscapes. Many of the photos are people-less, which I like. I\u2019m not sure how active it is, but it\u2019s maybe worth checking out.\n\n[**If You Leave**](https://www.instagram.com/ifyouleavestagram/) **(#ifyouleave) (152k)**\n\nBig M O O D. Cinematic pics out the wazoo. Even the name is dramatic. This account has been around since 2009, before certain film cameras started costing more than cars. I like their curation.\n\n[**Film Photo Mag**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotomag/) **(#filmphotomag) (137k)**\n\nThere seems to be an emphasis on grainy photos on this page, some of which are underexposed (but who cares!). Moody stuff. Lots of cities, lots of silhouettes. That kind of thing.\n\n[**Tainted Magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/taintedmag/) **(#taintedmag) (9k)**\n\nLots of fine art portraiture, sometimes of famous people. The curation seems to favor innovative poses and composition that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a fancy MFA program. Think Ryan McGinley, or someone whose work is more abstract than that. The photos here look like they could be in NY Mag or the NYT magazine. Or a museum, really.\n\n[**Film Shooters Collective**](https://www.instagram.com/filmshooterscollective/) **(#heyfsc) (80k)**\n\nThis account has been around for quite some time, and you\u2019ll notice that some of their curation highlights photos that embrace the imperfections of film. By this, I mean photos shot on expired film, or photos with light leaks. If you like double exposures, this might be a good hashtag for you to use.\n\n[**Photo Filmy**](https://www.instagram.com/photo.filmy/) **(#photofilmy) (74k)**\n\nThere tends to be a focus on geometrically-pleasing images here. Lots of beautiful old buildings, some Americana-influenced stuff. There\u2019s an interesting mix of curation here, and a number of the photos are densely layered.\n\n[**Ain't\u2013Bad**](https://www.instagram.com/aintbad/) **(#aintbad) (70k)**\n\nThis is less of a feature account and more of a real-assed magazine/publisher. There\u2019s more of an emphasis here on body of work (photo essays, photo books) than singles, which I really like because a cohesive body of work is what eventually sets you apart from the kind of photographers who just take pretty pictures.\n\n*NOTE: I found out after writing this that there are some* ***serious underlying issues with Ain\u2019t Bad***\\*, which you can find out about on Instagram. Notably, they have failed to support people of color and lack diversity in their programming. There are also accusations of sexual assault that have been brought up against people involved with Ain\u2019t Bad. It\u2019s\\* ***really*** *disappointing and disheartening to read about because I\u2019ve found some great photographers through their site. Consider not using this hashtag.*\n\n[**Back 2 the Base**](https://www.instagram.com/back2thebase/) **(#back2thebase) (44k)**\n\nA mixture of Ian Howorth-esque emptiness, portraiture, and street photography. Quite artsy. I like their logo.\n\n[**Drive By Film**](https://www.instagram.com/drivebyfilm/) **(#drivebyfilm) (31k)**\n\nSpoiler alert: there are a lot of beautiful cars on this account\u2019s page, along with some gas stations, and a little bit of night work. It seems to be very focused on American scenes, though to be fair, so are many other accounts.\n\n[**Restore from Backup**](https://www.instagram.com/restorefrombackup/) **(#restorefrombackup) (31k)**\n\nI\u2019m biased in my love for this account because they\u2019ve shared my photography on multiple occasions (and more than other feature accounts have), but they place a really high value on community-building, and in that way it\u2019s like a mixture of [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/) and [r/analogcommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/analogcommunity/). From what I can tell it\u2019s run by good people who don\u2019t have a superiority complex about photography. They also do a nice job of showcasing work from smaller accounts.\n\n[**Burbs on Film**](https://www.instagram.com/burbsonfilm/) **(#burbsonfilm) (26k)**\n\nThere are plenty of photos of suburbs on this page, but they\u2019re not exclusively shot in suburban settings. A number of these photographs subvert traditional stereotypes of the United States, though some are pretty straightforward in their scope. Lots of these photos feel like they\u2019re from another era.\n\n[**Make Me See Mag**](https://www.instagram.com/makemeseemag/) **(#makemeseemag) (24k)**\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed with the photos that this account features is that they mostly feature photographs that have a dynamic subject that your eye zeroes in on immediately.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ghqhgn/a_guide_to_film_photography_feature_accounts_on/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "tagged", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "a guide to film photography feature accounts on instagram (originally posted on analog community) /!/ hey r/photography! this is a guide i wrote to analog feature accounts on instagram. i know there are a lot of useless hashtags out there, and i wanted to highlight some feature accounts that might be a good start for film photographers who are interesting in finding inspiring work and sharing their own with the ig community. \n\nthis list is in no way meant to be exhaustive, as that would be impossible, but for those of you who are starting out with film photography and wondering how to share your work, there are a number of accounts that have their own hashtags, and mostly feature photos that are -----> tagged !!!  with those hashtags. there are so many of these accounts that it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell them apart, so part of why i wanted to write this is to help demystify their differences.\n\nsome of these accounts are legitimate print outlets, though some of them just exist on instagram. some of them \u2013 particularly the larger accounts \u2013 may not rely on hashtags for discovering work at all, even though it seems like they do. your mileage may vary, and to be honest, it\u2019s sometimes a popularity contest, especially with accounts that have more than 200k followers. but other photographers may follow these hashtags and discover your work as a result.\n\nthere\u2019s a lot of crossover with these accounts. you\u2019ll see certain photos and photographers that are featured on multiple accounts, which is i guess the film photography version of going viral. you know the kind of photos i\u2019m talking about \u2013 the kind that are peppered throughout instagram\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section, or the ones that hit the top of [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/). the kind that win contests. the ones that make you wish that you too were a master of nailing exposure and stumbling across (or creating) scenes that take your breath away.\n\nanyways, here\u2019s a rough guide to curated feature accounts, sorted by the size of their follower-base. instagram pages are linked. as a disclaimer, i think that curation is more important than popularity, and some of the smaller ones are run by people who are more involved in the analog community. most of them are focused on film photography, but they\u2019re not all exclusively analog. some featured photos just have a film \u201cvibe\u201d or aesthetic, which may annoy some people here. lastly, these are just my opinions. this is a subjective guide. i'm not an expert -- i'm just a fan.\n\none thing i want to say is that you should **never pay for features**. i know it's tempting, everybody wants to get their work seen, but these accounts are popular because of other people's work. if anything, they should pay you for the use of your photography. i haven't mentioned certain accounts here because of this.\n\nanyways...\n\n**\\~ \\~ a list of film photography feature accounts \\~ \\~**\n\n[**somewhere magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/somewheremagazine/) **(#somewheremagazine) (861k followers)**\n\nsomewhere magazine is one of the larger accounts out there. there\u2019s a nice mixture of cinematic scenes and more abstract lens-based art on this page, and it lives up to its claim of being a \u201cmood board\u201d.\n\n[**film wave**](https://www.instagram.com/film.wave/) **(#filmwave) (275k)**\n\nthis account has a tendency to post photos that are in some ways related to the act of analog photography in a meta kind of way. you\u2019ll find analog self portraits, photos of cameras, etc. on here. there\u2019s obviously more to their curation than that, as it is a large account with a large fanbase, but if you have a beautifully shot gear pic, this might be the account for you to tag.\n\n[**nowhere diary**](https://www.instagram.com/nowherediary/) **(#nowherediary) (257k)**\n\nlots of night scenes and foggy, moody photography. lots of beautiful, empty scenes with no people in them, though some photos do feature people. what i like about this account is their tendency to pair some of their posts with lengthy written blurbs about photography. they have a series of nowhere diary legend posts where they introduce their audience to famous photographers, which is a cool way to find out about significant photographers if you\u2019re new to photography and/or less plugged in to the historical side of things.\n\n[**film photographic**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotographic/) **(#filmphotographic) (204k)**\n\none of the founders and curators is jason lee, which is cool. also a gallery and book publisher. there\u2019s an emphasis on more rural scenes here and landscapes. many of the photos are people-less, which i like. i\u2019m not sure how active it is, but it\u2019s maybe worth checking out.\n\n[**if you leave**](https://www.instagram.com/ifyouleavestagram/) **(#ifyouleave) (152k)**\n\nbig m o o d. cinematic pics out the wazoo. even the name is dramatic. this account has been around since 2009, before certain film cameras started costing more than cars. i like their curation.\n\n[**film photo mag**](https://www.instagram.com/filmphotomag/) **(#filmphotomag) (137k)**\n\nthere seems to be an emphasis on grainy photos on this page, some of which are underexposed (but who cares!). moody stuff. lots of cities, lots of silhouettes. that kind of thing.\n\n[**tainted magazine**](https://www.instagram.com/taintedmag/) **(#taintedmag) (9k)**\n\nlots of fine art portraiture, sometimes of famous people. the curation seems to favor innovative poses and composition that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a fancy mfa program. think ryan mcginley, or someone whose work is more abstract than that. the photos here look like they could be in ny mag or the nyt magazine. or a museum, really.\n\n[**film shooters collective**](https://www.instagram.com/filmshooterscollective/) **(#heyfsc) (80k)**\n\nthis account has been around for quite some time, and you\u2019ll notice that some of their curation highlights photos that embrace the imperfections of film. by this, i mean photos shot on expired film, or photos with light leaks. if you like double exposures, this might be a good hashtag for you to use.\n\n[**photo filmy**](https://www.instagram.com/photo.filmy/) **(#photofilmy) (74k)**\n\nthere tends to be a focus on geometrically-pleasing images here. lots of beautiful old buildings, some americana-influenced stuff. there\u2019s an interesting mix of curation here, and a number of the photos are densely layered.\n\n[**ain't\u2013bad**](https://www.instagram.com/aintbad/) **(#aintbad) (70k)**\n\nthis is less of a feature account and more of a real-assed magazine/publisher. there\u2019s more of an emphasis here on body of work (photo essays, photo books) than singles, which i really like because a cohesive body of work is what eventually sets you apart from the kind of photographers who just take pretty pictures.\n\n*note: i found out after writing this that there are some* ***serious underlying issues with ain\u2019t bad***\\*, which you can find out about on instagram. notably, they have failed to support people of color and lack diversity in their programming. there are also accusations of sexual assault that have been brought up against people involved with ain\u2019t bad. it\u2019s\\* ***really*** *disappointing and disheartening to read about because i\u2019ve found some great photographers through their site. consider not using this hashtag.*\n\n[**back 2 the base**](https://www.instagram.com/back2thebase/) **(#back2thebase) (44k)**\n\na mixture of ian howorth-esque emptiness, portraiture, and street photography. quite artsy. i like their logo.\n\n[**drive by film**](https://www.instagram.com/drivebyfilm/) **(#drivebyfilm) (31k)**\n\nspoiler alert: there are a lot of beautiful cars on this account\u2019s page, along with some gas stations, and a little bit of night work. it seems to be very focused on american scenes, though to be fair, so are many other accounts.\n\n[**restore from backup**](https://www.instagram.com/restorefrombackup/) **(#restorefrombackup) (31k)**\n\ni\u2019m biased in my love for this account because they\u2019ve shared my photography on multiple occasions (and more than other feature accounts have), but they place a really high value on community-building, and in that way it\u2019s like a mixture of [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/) and [r/analogcommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/analogcommunity/). from what i can tell it\u2019s run by good people who don\u2019t have a superiority complex about photography. they also do a nice job of showcasing work from smaller accounts.\n\n[**burbs on film**](https://www.instagram.com/burbsonfilm/) **(#burbsonfilm) (26k)**\n\nthere are plenty of photos of suburbs on this page, but they\u2019re not exclusively shot in suburban settings. a number of these photographs subvert traditional stereotypes of the united states, though some are pretty straightforward in their scope. lots of these photos feel like they\u2019re from another era.\n\n[**make me see mag**](https://www.instagram.com/makemeseemag/) **(#makemeseemag) (24k)**\n\nwhat i\u2019ve noticed with the photos that this account features is that they mostly feature photographs that have a dynamic subject that your eye zeroes in on immediately. there\u2019s a little bit of flash photography thrown into the mix, which is nice. the curation is pretty varied and some of the photos are shot in quite innovative ways. it\u2019s a great account that deserves a larger following.\n\n[**the film stead**](https://www.instagram.com/thefilmstead/) **(#thefilmstead) (11k)**\n\nsoothing, beautiful photography with a focus on architecture and landscapes. in a world where so many photographs are moody and dark, it\u2019s nice to see photos that have a happier, more positive vibe.\n\n\\-----\n\n**accounts with less than 10k followers that might be worth your time:**\n\n[**every day rural

advice/guidance. \n\nBackground:  \nI've been photographing for roughly 10 years on and off and have six years working in Marketing roles with big and small companies throughout Silicon Valley. In the last year, I really got into videography after helping my dad with recipe and cooking videos (he sells high-end kitchen supply products) that we later published on social to drive brand awareness. I managed all of my dad's social from creating the content to publishing to reporting for both paid and organic. Long story short, since shelter-in-place, we pivoted to Facebook Live and have averaged 15k\\~ in sales monthly. We're doing live cooking videos 2x a week, an hour each, and doing giveaways/mass texting our client list to get people to join. \n\nWhy:  \nI'll like to combine everything I love: photography, videography, social, marketing, and helping small businesses and make a business out of it. \n\nService:  \nI want to help small businesses increase their brand awareness by creating social content for them and managing their social channels. I would go and shoot at their place 1-2x a month eg: coffee shop, restaurant, etc, and build out an organic social content strategy that consists of scheduling posts and managing their reporting  - they can also go into paid if that's something they may want too. The way people are communicating and engaging is through social so it's important for brands to have an authentic identity online driven by high-quality and engaging content. Through this content, you increase brand awareness and stay top of mind; build a connection with your customer, and gain trust. \n\nStarting:   \nI need to build out a portfolio with imagery/video smaller businesses can find relevant and see themselves having for their own business. I did mention I've been photographing on/off for 10 years but I feel that imagery doesn't align as I did mostly portraits and street so I'm not sure if it's something I want to show as my portfolio. In order to build relationships with smaller businesses and build out a relevant portfolio, I'll like to start off by offering free images/video for social and asking to just be credited via a tagged post so their followers can hear about me. This will also allow me to have content to publish on my own social and showcase my work + build out my portfolio. \n\nHow will I find people?  \n I plan to start off by DMing local businesses giving them a short background of what I'm looking to do and if they would be interested in what I'm offering for FREE. I would also highlight the benefits of what I'm doing. I definitely see this working but in the case that it doesn't, I'll have to run paid social ads locally.\n\nHow much to charge:  \nI'll like to come up with some sort of package that includes \\~10 posts a month consisting of 8-12 pictures and 2 videos (1 long (1min\\~) and 1 short form (15-30s), reporting, and consultancy. Unless we measure conversions via a coupon, unfortunately, branding is not quantifiable and as a result, I'm not sure if smaller businesses will see a benefit to my service - resulting in devaluing the work I'm doing. \n\nFor those interested, my equipment:  \nCamera: XT4  \nlens: XF 16-55 2.8   \ngimbal: Ronin S-C \n\nThank you for reading.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/h8eppr/following_my_passion_and_starting_a_media_company/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "tagged", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "following my passion and starting a media company /!/ hi guys,\n\ni'm looking to start a local media company for small businesses and i'm seeking advice/guidance. \n\nbackground:  \ni've been photographing for roughly 10 years on and off and have six years working in marketing roles with big and small companies throughout silicon valley. in the last year, i really got into videography after helping my dad with recipe and cooking videos (he sells high-end kitchen supply products) that we later published on social to drive brand awareness. i managed all of my dad's social from creating the content to publishing to reporting for both paid and organic. long story short, since shelter-in-place, we pivoted to facebook live and have averaged 15k\\~ in sales monthly. we're doing live cooking videos 2x a week, an hour each, and doing giveaways/mass texting our client list to get people to join. \n\nwhy:  \ni'll like to combine everything i love: photography, videography, social, marketing, and helping small businesses and make a business out of it. \n\nservice:  \ni want to help small businesses increase their brand awareness by creating social content for them and managing their social channels. i would go and shoot at their place 1-2x a month eg: coffee shop, restaurant, etc, and build out an organic social content strategy that consists of scheduling posts and managing their reporting  - they can also go into paid if that's something they may want too. the way people are communicating and engaging is through social so it's important for brands to have an authentic identity online driven by high-quality and engaging content. through this content, you increase brand awareness and stay top of mind; build a connection with your customer, and gain trust. \n\nstarting:   \ni need to build out a portfolio with imagery/video smaller businesses can find relevant and see themselves having for their own business. i did mention i've been photographing on/off for 10 years but i feel that imagery doesn't align as i did mostly portraits and street so i'm not sure if it's something i want to show as my portfolio. in order to build relationships with smaller businesses and build out a relevant portfolio, i'll like to start off by offering free images/video for social and asking to just be credited via a -----> tagged !!!  post so their followers can hear about me. this will also allow me to have content to publish on my own social and showcase my work + build out my portfolio. \n\nhow will i find people?  \n i plan to start off by dming local businesses giving them a short background of what i'm looking to do and if they would be interested in what i'm offering for free. i would also highlight the benefits of what i'm doing. i definitely see this working but in the case that it doesn't, i'll have to run paid social ads locally.\n\nhow much to charge:  \ni'll like to come up with some sort of package that includes \\~10 posts a month consisting of 8-12 pictures and 2 videos (1 long (1min\\~) and 1 short form (15-30s), reporting, and consultancy. unless we measure conversions via a coupon, unfortunately, branding is not quantifiable and as a result, i'm not sure if smaller businesses will see a benefit to my service - resulting in devaluing the work i'm doing. \n\nfor those interested, my equipment:  \ncamera: xt4  \nlens: xf 16-55 2.8   \ngimbal: ronin s-c \n\nthank you for reading.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 80725, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 79133, "autor": "NoeticIntelligence", "date": 1594600217000, "content": "What is a tool that you use to classify your photographs?

I'm sure that this is an oft-discussed issue - I worry that this is the equivalent to starting an oil thread on a motorcycle forum... But I also think that I can't be the only person stuck on this.\n\nFor context, I'm strictly a hobby photographer, and will stay that way. All of the photos I take and share are related to friends &amp; family, or my hobbies.\n\nI use Backblaze for online backup of my raw images, Lightroom catalog, and exported post-processed images, so this isn't really about backup. I also use a combination of Google Photos, Flickr, and Facebook to share those post-processed images. It basically breaks down to: Facebook for sharing stuff of my family &amp; friends where it's appropriate; Google Photos to share stuff with very specific people (like photos of my kids with friends' kids on a playdate - I'll send an album link to a Google Photos album to the parents but not post their kids on FB); and Flickr for hobby-related stuff that I want to easily share on online forums (I like the BBCode and multiple-sizes support built in to Flickr).\n\nBut I'd like to have a single point of access for review and sharing of everything I've completed processing &amp; exported.\n\nWhat I'd really like to do seems simple:\n\n1. Automatically upload everything in my top-level Exports folder to online storage that's accessible by Web and mobile app. By default those photos should not be visible to the public. Google Backup &amp; Sync and the Flickr Uploadr both do this (although I've had infuriating unexplained failures with Flickr Uploadr).\n2. Maintain the information from the folder structure within that Exports folder (like tags or albums). Flickr does this, Google Photos (amazingly) does not.\n3. Integrate with Chromecast and Apple TV for showing photos from a given album or tag in a slideshow *from my Android device*. Google Photos works very well with Chromecast, and apparently has some absolute shit screen mirroring support for Apple TV. Flickr just ignores this basic feature, it's been languishing on a wishlist for years now. Chromecast is more important than Apple TV, because that's what my Mom and I both use, but my godson's parents use Apple TV, so it would be nice to have a solution for that, too.\n\nI don't mind paying for a solution to this. It is absolutely shocking to me that Google just totally discards the folder info when uploading, and equally surprising that Flickr can't cast slideshows. These three requirements seem so basic as to be effectively universal.\n\nHunting around a bit, I found that SmugMug has the notion of folders, and the 3rd-party PicBackMan will do auto-upload to SmugMug (and other services) and preserve the folder structure from the source, and make those backed-up folders private by default. So, that covers items 1 and 2. I'm not clear about 3. My attempts to find out about the features of the SmugMug Android app have been kind of depressing.\n\nCan the SmugMug Android app cast to a Chromecast device? Can it make a slideshow from a selected folder? If so, that might be my choice.\n\nDoes anyone have an automated solution that covers the above 3 requirements?
