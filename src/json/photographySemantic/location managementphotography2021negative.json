Essentially renting the studio from ourselves, paying from our individual businesses. \n\nMy partner thinks that since we\u2019re each paying rent to run the studio and that we shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything additional to use the space for client projects. \n\nWhere I run into an issue is when we have an opportunity to rent the studio out to a paying customer but it\u2019s already booked with a shoot that my partner is doing for a client and therefore the studio is not making any income and we lose the gig. Essentially I\u2019m paying 50% of the rent for my partner to use the studio and we lose money. \n\nHis argument is that we make money doing client work there and \u201cwhy should we pay to shoot there when we\u2019re already paying rent?\u201d\n\nMy response is, \u201cjust add on a studio fee into the shoot and pay the business.\u201d \n\nWhat do you think? What is the best way to approach this situation? We\u2019re a brand new studio and we\u2019re still ironing out our business practices and I\u2019d like to start things off on the right foot.
