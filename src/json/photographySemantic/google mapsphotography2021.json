But for me, it does not have to be free.\n\nLet me explain my use case first. Right now I have 2 pools of photos/videos:\n\n1. Google Photos, which contains JPEG snapshots and videos taken by smartphones. There isn't an easy way of seeing how much data I have exactly on Google Photos, but my estimate is that I have between 1 and 2 TB in my Google Photos. Google also estimates that 2TB will last me approximately 2 years, so this pool is growing fast.\n2. Local external drive backed up to Backblaze, which contains raw photos and videos taken by \"real\" cameras. Here I have just over 1TB of stuff, and this pool is also growing fast.\n\nAnd here are some of the considerations I have for choosing an alternative.\n\n1. Since Google says my existing stuff in Google Photos will not count towards my storage, the ability of migrating from Google Photos isn't exactly a priority but would be nice to have. If it's not easy to migrate, the new solution will simply get new photos after the switch, and I'm okay with that.\n2. The new solution should have good exporting capabilities. This was one of my original concerns of Google Photos, but I decided to bite the bullet since it was free. And fortunately right now, Google seems to be honoring the free storage for existing photos. Nonetheless, I want the ability to easily migrate away from the service.\n3. The new solution should offer unlimited, or close to unlimited storage. I already have about 2TB of data today and it's only going to grow. All the xx GB/month solutions I've taken a look at are going to be way too expensive.\n4. The new solution should have good mobile support, i.e. I can view the photos/videos from a smartphone. This is actually my biggest complaint about my current Backblaze based solution.\n5. Since I'm looking at an alternative anyway, I think it would be neat to have a solution for both of my photo pools. This is not a requirement. The main reason is that currently both of my photo pools are growing rather rapidly. The first pool is scalable but Google is changing that. The second pool is simply not very scalable, and it will hit its limit sooner or later.\n6. It would be nice to have some \"family sharing\" capabilities. This is mainly for the first pool. A lot of it is just family snapshots, so if I can easily let family members contribute to it, it's definitely a bonus.\n\nAnd here are some of the alternatives I've taken a look at, and here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about things.\n\n1. Cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. are simply not an option, because they will either be capped at 2TB, or ridiculously expensive for the amount of storage I need. I also looked at some Nextcloud providers and they all seem very expensive, and the storage is nowhere near unlimited.\n2. Amazon Photos does not seem to offer good exporting options. Also, it only offers 5GB of space for video, which is kind of a deal breaker. Other than that, it seems like a pretty compelling option. It offers good family sharing support, and it supports raw files, and Amazon Prime offers other perks. Because of the lack of video storage, I don't think this is an option for me.\n3. SmugMug looks pretty promising. From what I've seen, it doesn't really offer good family sharing. Also in terms of exporting, I only see 2 options, which are in-browser downloads, and a 3rd party app based on Adobe Air, which you can no longer get. I wonder how good the in-browser exporting is. Also, their website explicitly mentions \"unlimited uploading\". Does that mean downloading is somehow limited? Am I just overthinking? Overall I think SmugMug checks a lot of the boxes. From what I've seen, people seem to be using SmugMug to make photography websites, and that's not what I'm looking for. I just want a good storage solution. Is it a good fit even though I won't be using their flagship feature?\n\nSo what do you guys think? Do you have answers to some of the questions I have above? Do you have other suggestions?
