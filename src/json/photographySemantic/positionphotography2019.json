This post wont be talking about firearms as I feel there are more important things to talk about. i hope that you all personally share some tips that you have or things you have noticed that you feel would be helpful for other photographers.\n\nI'm not very good with words when it comes to writing but i think my points are simple and easy to digest.\n\nThe Risks and How to Manage Them :\n\n**Valuable items**\n\nI think its important for us as photographers to understand that our hobby/job puts us in a position that draws unwanted attention to us. Being in possession of valuable items is something that is going to draw attention to even you regardless of where you are.\n\nEven someone who doesn't know any names of any camera companies could spot your 70-200f2.8 and know that the camera is valuable. Your large backpack that you pulled your camera out of most certainly will indicate to potential thieves that you have even more than you currently have in your hand.\n\nThe best way to reduce the risk associated with possessing cameras is by reducing the appearance of you camera and making yourself look less desirable.\n\n**Lack of Situational Awareness**\n\nWhen you are looking through the viewfinder or staring at the monitor it is very easy to get completely absorbed for long periods of time into what you are doing. It is important to work on maintaining your awareness of your surroundings.\n\nIt is very easy to spot when someone is not paying attention to their surroundings and this is something that many thieves and assailants look for when picking a target. Maintaining a level of awareness makes you a less vulnerable target.\n\nIn addition to making you less likely to fall victim to someone else it also helps keep you safe from yourself. Where I usually find myself taking pictures there are usually tripping hazards or other things that i would be better off avoiding.\n\nAVOID TUNNEL VISION. This will help you stay safe and maybe help you find a better composition. I use a both eyes open technique when not actively taking a picture. By keeping my non shooting eye open for much of my time I am able to increase my peripheral vision and up my general awareness.\n\nPeople who are aware are less likely to be targeted and more capable of reacting to a situation where they are targeted.\n\n**Location**\n\nDoing what we do leads to us eventually being in places or scenarios that are less than ideal. Whether you are in an impoverished neighborhood, a rural countryside, or out somewhere at night you will find yourself somewhere less than ideal when it comes to safety.\n\nIn RURAL areas like forests and on hikes i try to make sure i have packed for the proper weather, have a first aid kit, bear spray, sunscreen and bug spray, and that I stay hydrated/fed. The threats of rural areas can usually be mitigated by proper first aid and water supply. For those of you in bear country, I recommend that you have proper bear spray as it is more reliable at stopping bears than guns on average.\n\nIn urban environments its important to pay attention to the two legged threats. I have had some very close calls with people living on the streets in California and have learned that its usually best to not engage with someone who tries to grab your attention or latch on to you. Every time that I have acknowledged or engaged with someone who tried hard to demand my attention it has been a much more dangerous situation than the times when I ignore and don't allow them to latch on to me. I understand that the way I am talking about some members of the homeless community is most likely not politically correct. These is just how I have learned to shorten and avoid the unwanted interaction.\n\n**Night Time**\n\ncarry a flashlight for the night is dark and full of terrors.\n\nSeriously the size of some very capable flashlights are so easy to carry you wont know it is there. personally i carry a small OLight that is super cheap, very bright, and is rechargeable much like an apple watch.\n\nhaving a flashlight will give you more information of your surroundings and make you appear as less of a target to potential threats.\n\nYour phone doesn't count as a main light source in my book. They are most likely to die at the same hours that you need a flashlight. Phone lights aren't very bright and don't cast light as far. Having a light is a great tool and you will find yourself using it much more often the longer you carry one.\n\n[Link to flashlight](https://olightworld.com/led-flashlights/all-flashlights/olight-s1-mini-baton)\n\nMiscellaneous Discussion:\n\nmany non lethal forms of self defense like pepper spray, tasers, and flashlights can be useful tools for keeping yourself safe. I recommend that everyone have some form of defensive tool that is non lethal regardless of if you choose to carry a gun or a knife. Having more tools allows you to solve more problems. Only carry something that you are willing to practice with and mentally prepared to use.\n\ni almost always have some sort of booboo kit in my car. band aids, first aid cream, and some basic medicine can make a day much more enjoyable. i also typically have with me a basic \"trauma kit\" but that is more of a topic of its own that I'm not qualified to teach.\n\nA book that I recommend that everyone read is The Gift of Fear. Excellent book that discusses all aspects of spotting dangerous signs and threat signals. The techniques in the book have helped me feel more secure and confident in my daily life since i feel more in control of my surroundings.

However, a common anxiety is whether or not they are sufficiently powerful to overpower the sun, even when paired in an AD-B2.\n\nI've gone ahead and tested a pair of AD200s in Sunlight to see how it actually holds up. Here are the results: https://imgur.com/a/a3Kgq7D\n\nIn summary, yes... The AD200 can in fact overpower the sun. And they can do so relatively comfortably.\n\nThe setup uses the Godox AD-B2 in a Godox 60x60cm softbox. A pair of standard AD200s, and bare-bulb heads. The camera was a Sony A7RIII with the 50mm \u01921.4 ZA, with the Flashpoint R2 Pro II (not that the camera, trigger, or lens matter.)\n\nBecause of the relatively large size of the soft-box, I chose not to use a diffuser. The bulbs are not shielded, so this projects more light on the subject than it would otherwise.\n\nWith this setup, the scene was exposed at ISO 100, \u019211, 1/250\", with the face of the soft-box positioned about 1m away from the subject. The strobe exposed the scene about 3 stops above ambient. A grey card metered at \u01928, 1/250\", ISO 100 in the same spot (slightly below Sunny 16.)\n\nThese results also suggest that a single light can be used, given the right shooting conditions and modifiers. I plan to test with some other modifiers later.\n\nIMO, this is very useful for anyone debating the choice between a pair of AD200s, the AD400, or an AD600.\n\nYou still may want the AD600 for the most demanding uses; shooting lots of photographs in direct sunlight, or shooting large subjects. Subjects who do nothing but overpower the sun will probably want an AD600 or AD400.\n\nHowever, I suspect that most photographers will find a pair of AD200s more than sufficient for this use case. And the major benefit of this approach is that you can split the strobes up for multi-point lighting.

The only way to survive with an healthy and integrated life balance in today society is through acquiring money (which ironically, the stress and worries related to money often scorn our health and \u00a0life balance). The amount of money needed will depend on the values and views of those around you I suppose.  \n\n\nWhat I disagree in this view is about money being the means of every human relation. It's the meaning for social integration at certain level but not the meaning of human interaction. Humans, as any alive organism, strive for survival and according to [Antonio Damasio](https://www.antoniodamasio.com/) such survival is measured by the organism balance. We have the perception of balance through emotion (visible or invisible somatic action and movements in reaction to something that provoked them), meaning that we perceive what causes us joy or irritability (and anything in between) and react according to it. In short, we build emotional defenses against what causes us distress and emotional attachment to what cause us joy in order to maintain a balance for life preservation and perpetuation. Simple living organisms such as insects, mono-cellular and even bacteria don't have consciousness of their emotions (which is not the same as feelings). Only animals who have feelings (mental images) can feel what they emote, which require a more developed nervous system. As Antonio Damasio simplify in a short quote, *\"emotions play in the theater of the body. Feelings play in the theater of the mind\".*  \n\n\nWe can then conclude that the meaning of human interaction is Joy. Even if the job we work with is not joyful, we do it for the payment, normally through monetary earning. Money which bring us a joyful feeling, not because of the money itself but because of the joyful things (and people) we can obtain through it. And the most joyful thing one can have is to contemplate oneself as the cause of joy of others according to Lordon.  \n\n\n*\"Since this \\[joy\\] is renewed as man considers his virtues, or his power of acting, everyone is anxious to tell his own deeds, and show off his powers, both of body and mind.\"* \\-\u00a0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lordon,\u00a0[Willing Slaves of Capital: Spinoza and Marx on Desire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18112211-willing-slaves-of-capital).  \n\n\nDuring my early adulthood I was often taking the buses in front of the building I used to live. As normally, at least for me, I had always been ignored. Not disrespected but ignored. At least until I started attending a flight attendant course that imposed on me the demand of a very formal looking and behavior. When I left home for the first time wearing suit and tie, in a such elegant and status symbol outfit,\u00a0was when I noticed I had people attention, servitude and privileged treatment. Bus drivers welcoming with \"good morning sir\", shop attendants looking forwards to serve me first and women who usually would avoid contact and interaction with me were now smiley and approachable. I was the same poor guy as before only that I was in a fancy clothes going to, and returning from, a fancy neighborhood. The talk about the social prejudice in Brazilian society back then was still a kind of taboo among many people (despite today's obviousness), but it was a clear fact I deduced from my experience. Such experience made me feel good about myself, but I could not just ignore the fact that people was treating me based on a believe they have about me that wasn't true, based on my clothes symbolism. A believe on my power of acting, my power of causing others joy, biological and social harmony satisfaction, which they wish to acquire through me.  \n\n\nIn 2008 I arrived in Ireland where I met great photographers and models who, thanks to them, I could learn from, build my portfolio with and get some jobs as photographer through. Over all, excluding some exceptions, we were not looking for money or status in a direct way but have fun, have joy. Models, makeup artists and photographers\u00a0among other creators\u00a0were happy to be part of projects for the creativity and joy sake, that consequently helped us in further opportunities in our respective industries. Enjoying and respecting each other work without snobbish attitude, aloofness or competition about who has the privilege to be the joy provider to others but agreeing that we share joy among us, making we all feeling in harmony working with each other, a biological (consequently emotional) and social harmony balance, all offering and acquiring the power of acting from each other, without the monetary gate keeping. Money? it always could be negotiated according to what we could afford. I was paying my bills working in a convenience store which was fine. My time in Ireland was the most joyful and prolific in my life, all that required little money but only trust. I found models searching among university students and I met many people through street photography.  \n\n\nMoney is the value that gives us the power of acting, but we must not forget that the monetary value is not in the money itself but in the power of creation, of acting. This is the joy we are after and to truly obtain such joy it requires trust. Otherwise, the joy of monetary power monopoly\u00a0creates envy and segregation, consequently social stress. [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger) says that the happiness of being envied is called glamour.  \n\n\n\"Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance. It depends precisely upon *not sharing your experience with those who envy you.* You are observed with interest but you do not observe with interest - if you do, you will become less enviable. In this respect the envied are like bureaucrats; the more impersonal they are, the greater the illusion (for themselves and for others) of their power. The power of the glamorous resides in their supposed happiness: the power of the bureaucrat in his supposed authority.\u201d\u00a0\u2015\u00a0John Berger,\u00a0[Ways of Seeing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing)  \n\n\nI arrived in Germany with the expectation to continuous the photography life style I had in Ireland but I was wrong about it. Making contacts became rare, everybody is looking for money even though they don't need it. Being able to offer joy through my work became not enough, because people are not interested in sharing joy but in monopolize it through monetary status, using the money status as gate keeping, as trust symbol. Even among models and creators who look for no payment collaborative work, they often are looking for photographers who show to have fancy tools, a dedicated studio in a fix address. It doesn't matter to them the result and the joy of the activity unless it can be provided through monetary status, as the access to a monopolized joy which they can justify their aloofness and segregation.  \n\n\nIt also results on a social fear, a distrust on people who look for joy sharing without segregation, suspicious of them as if they have second intentions, the intention to steal something from you maintained through\u00a0the monetary gate keeping. Them seen as segregated\u00a0from the privilege of your monopolistic joy, the ones who lack acting power and consequently have not much to provide as a joy, therefore desperate to take it from you.  \n\n\nModels and photographers seem to compete on their self importance, on who is the joy provider to the other, instead of enjoying it as a joy exchange though helping each other for a same result goal. People are not approachable because of the distrust that strangers\u00a0attempt of interaction has either monetary or sexual (joyful) goal or is a mad person. The other human interaction attempt can only be about dubious intention of climbing and preserve the intrinsic joy of being the joy provider in a monopolistic status kept through monetary (and sexual) border.  \n\n\nI think the key is empathy and understanding of what really matters, what we are striving\u00a0for. We are striving\u00a0for balance that comes with joy. Through such understanding I suppose we can learn the importance of trust and honesty required for us to be able to enjoy life and society together. Because\u00a0*Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.*\n\nhttp://www.marciofaustino.com/blog/the-economics-of-joy-or-the-strive-for-balance", "link":

I'm in a bad situation, but nothing that time wont heal.\n\nSo, I've been slowly getting into concert photography since the last year. I've went to some events, took some shots, learned a lot and tried, with not a lot of success, to reach out to bands/venues while getting close to none recognition. After the fourth concert with not even a \"thanks\" from the bands, I decided to stop for a while shooting and concentrate on other stuff (both in photography and in other hobbies) to clear my mind/reorganize myself.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, where I decided to go with a friend to a two-day festival (which is an annual event we also went the last year) to shoot again. After the second day, some of the organizers approached us to talk about the photos, as the event is a really small/underground stuff. They asked us for a contact to see our work, and felt that there was something going on.\n\nAnd of course it was. Two days after my friend tells me that one of the promoters (who also has a website) asked her to work (kind of, free press pass, you know) as photographer for events in our city, as the old photographer they got left and they were looking for someone to fill the position.\n\nAnd, even though I feel positively and genuine happy for her (she's going through some serious shit, and this is the kind of thing that could help her), I can't avoid feeling like someone has punched me in the stomach and basically spit on all the work I've put in my photography, for this event and for all the others. I reached out to both of the organizers, got a photo featured on their Facebook, a \"thanks\" from one of them and not even an answer from the other (the one who offered the post to my friend). On the positive side, I've gotten a fair share of retweets/likes from bands and the venue, but still.\n\nNow, I get that most of you will talk about \"shooting for fun\" and \"for yourself\", learning and all that stuff, but for me, part of the cool part of concert photography was getting some recognition. It took me 6-7 months to rebuild the confidence and to convince myself that putting the time and effort on this was worth it, and after this, the thought of picking the camera, or even talking about photography, be it around here or with friends, feels like pretending to be something I'm not even at an amateur level. \n\nAnd I don't know where to go from this. I was supposed to be on holidays after some really stressful days at my day job, and today I've been able to sleep only four hours. I've been through my share of bullshit myself and this is exactly what I did not needed. I've got a lot of photos to work in, but I'm contemplating giving up altogether, deleting my concert stuff, close/make private the Flickr and Facebook pages, leave the camera to gather dust for a long, fucking, while and not talk again about photography. I'm not even on the mood to go to more concerts. \n\nSome bullet points, to put some more bricks on this wall of text:\n\n* I can think on several factors why she got the offer. She was faster with the photos (I guess my workflow sucks), she's younger than me (So maybe they though she would be easier to convince for a non-paid position), and reached out earlier to them through Facebook. For what I've seen on her work, there's some really good stuff there, but I guess I'm not in the best moment to provide critique, as I'm on the point of \"everything I've done sucks except this two or three shots.\"\n\n* On the other hand, I haven't really reached out to anyone for critique on my stuff, as I've been too focused on getting the photos out there, so maybe is that my work actually sucks.\n\n* I guess I'm part an introvert, as reaching out someone about my work makes me a little nervous, and usually breaking a conversation \"in cold\" is a big no for me. Needless to say, after this, I'm as far as I can from the \"reaching out to someone about my work\" point.\n\nSo, if you've got here after reading all of this, first of all, thanks. Hope this ranty-esque post does not get deleted here. \n\nAnyway, I could really use some advice on how should I focus this and how cope with all of this.

(post fgot kinda long; I put an abbreviated form of my main question at the end as a TLDR) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name's Scott. I'm a CNC lathe programmer from Houston TX.  I'm a total noob when it comes to photography. My main passions for as long as I can remember have been guitar and video games (mainly Call of Duty.  ...I know.. shhh)  . As well as PC building/tech. \n\nRecently I've been watching Peter McKinnon and Potato Jet and a couple other photography YouTube channels and it's really inspired me. I've been amazed by some of the video editing, quality of still shots, and just photography's power in general.  I've always wanted to make videos:  whether it's Call of Duty highlight films and gameplays, or guitar reviews/sound samples/songwriting, PC time lapse custom builds...  there's so much stuff I want to try. As a side note, as it relates to my question below:  I'm moving in 1 month, and in our new home i will be building a PC gaming setup/office studio.  Think big wooden countertop desk, widescreen monitor(s), area dedicated for filming/unboxing, area for guitars and music/audio,  ....ETC.  I want to incorporate photography into this setup. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've ALMOST pulled the trigger on a CanonM50 several times this past week.  I like the price point, the performance seems solid for both video and stills, articulating LCD..  etc. HOWEVER one of the main things that's holding me back is the lack of 120fps slow mo in 1080p.  Also the dual pixel A.F.  in 4k would be nice. really\\* would prefer 1080/120 ..  it does have 120fps but it's 720p.  even for a beginner I'm just not keen on using slow mo in 720p.  it's 2019.  . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyway. sorry if this sounds stupid. esp from someone as inexperienced as myself.  I am really considering saving for the Fuji XT3 as it has everything I'm looking for (and more) .. as well as looking at the EOS R.  (although this camera retains the dual pixel AF in 4k, I'm really put off by a $2k camera that won't do 120fps in HD. seems dumb to me. am I missing something here?  If the EOS R had that one feature, I'd likely be saving for it right now. Maybe I'm wrong, or they could add it via firmware?  IDK. ).  \n\nLast thing I'll mention before wrapping it up:  I'm also curious about time lapse capabilities. Ive done a decent amount of research (ok not very much) and I don't know much about the M50's time lapse ability.  This is DEFINITELY a priority.. arguably more than 120 fps. ( i could almost live with 60fps or 720p/120 upscaled to 1080) but ....  with NO time lapse, that's a deal breaker.  One of the first things I wanna do is a time lapse of me building my first \"HIGH end\" gaming PC. can anyone shed some light on if the M50 would do that well? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR I'm not planning on vlogging, but doing multiple things with heavier emphasis on video.  I want something versatile.. my main priorities:  able to shoot great stills, capture slow motion 1080/120 fps, do good time lapses, has to have a Mic input for audio, fully flip LCD preferred but not required.  leaning towards Canon M50 but it's lacking the 120/1080.  Also considering some Sony options (RX10 III/IV, RX100 IV/V/VI , ...others? a6400!! that's the one).   My budget is flexible. but would refer under 800-1k.  Going for a A7RIII or EOS R or GH5S would be nice/preferred, but would literally take me a couple months (or selling a guitar) to pull off.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat camera would you guys recommend in my position?  Do I go with the M50 and just be happy with it as I learn Premiere and collect accessories for my collection ?  Or do I take a NO COMPROMISES battle stance, say fk it, and..  save up for a monster?  :D \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks everyone\n\nSC", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/bny3gv/buying_advice_noob_question_re_canon_m50_vs_sony/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "buying advice: noob question re: canon m50 vs sony ______ ?? /!/ hi all!

You get on your trading platform, try to get some pips, and in the process you usually forget the most basic risk management practices.\n\nHere are five common habits that we use at Currency Traders Club\n\n1. Double, triple, even quadruple-check you orders\n\nElectronic trading has made it very easy for traders to execute trades. However, because of the ease and simplicity of electronic online trading, the chances of erroneous commands also rise significantly. Having a well-thought-out trading plan would be useless if you do not correctly input your orders.\n\nIn May 2010, the financial market experienced a huge crash due to a \u201cfat finger\u201d event. A trader in a large trading firm mistakenly sold $16 billion worth of future contracts instead of just $16 million.\n\nOther traders who saw the order thought that something big was about to happen, so they sold too. This resulted to a collective intraday drop of $1 trillion in the U.S. equity market. Needless to say, the trading firm, as well as those holding on to stocks, lost a lot of money.\n\nDouble, triple, even quadruple-checking your order is very important in avoiding costly and unnecessary blunders. [@wetradefx](https://richardrowedotblog.wordpress.com/mentions/wetradefx/) reviewing commands is part of our routine. It will just take a couple of seconds of your time!\n\n2. Always have a trading plan\n\nYou\u2019d think that all traders would have a trading plan by now. I have talked about having a trade plan many times in my previous blog posts. Unfortunately, a lot of traders still trade impulsively.\n\nThere are traders who trade completely on emotion and irrationally get into trades without thinking it through. At the very least, you should have a plan on where to enter or exit your positions. By doing so, you limit disastrous emotional reactions to adverse price movements.\n\n3. Take profit on your winning trades\n\nAnother commonly overlooked risk management that we practice at Currency Traders Club is taking some of your profits off the table while the price action is still in your favor.\n\nI know it\u2019s tempting to ride a trend with a full position all the way to your profit target, but taking off a part of your position limits your exposure to potential volatility. After all, the saying \u201cThe trend is your friend\u2026 until it ends\u201d didn\u2019t come from nothing, did it?\n\nLet\u2019s take the STA strategy or any other scaling technique for example. Let\u2019s say your trading plan calls for adding to your original position and moving your stop loss after a certain number of pips.\n\nIf you take some off of your position midway, you may at least end up with a small win even if that trend suddenly reverses on you.\n\n4. Take a step back from trading\n\nDo you feel like you\u2019re in a trading rut? Are your fundamental and technical analyses off more often that you\u2019d like to admit? If you said \u201cyes\u201d to these questions, then you probably just need to take a little time off from trading.\n\nWhat\u2019s good about staying away from the markets completely is that you\u2019re not emotionally invested in any position. This usually allows you to reset and see market themes and chart patterns from a renewed point of view. And sometimes, a break will help you realize what you did wrong in your last couple of trades.\n\nSo take a step back, try to resist the lure of pip-making for a while, and you\u2019ll most likely come back with a refreshed mind and a new and improved trading plan.\n\n5. Withdraw your money regularly\n\nWhile turning a couple of thousand bucks to a multi-gazillion trading account is a big confidence booster in trading, it\u2019s still advisable to withdraw some of your money regularly. For one, additional capital usually exposes you to impulsive decisions like trading with larger positions or overtrading.\n\nUnless your trading goal calls for increasing your position sizes or your number of trades, withdrawing some of your money is one of your best bets at limiting risk. Besides, haven\u2019t I told you often enough that being a consistently profitable requires your focus on the process and not on profits?\n\nTake some of your moolah from time to time; take a vacation with your partner or your friends; buy something fancy for yourself, and enjoy the hard-earned fruits of your labor.\n\nAbout Dr. Pipslow\n\nDr. Pipslow\n\nIf you can\u2019t keep your emotions in check when trading, you will lose money. Lots of it. The most significant action that you can do to improve trading profits is to work on yourself. Really knowing yourself and how you think can give you an edge that others in the market don\u2019t have.
