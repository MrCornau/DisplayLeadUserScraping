It was off of a referral and I was speaking to the grandma of the person who I was taking photos of. We discussed how it would go down, I told her that I would find some locations that would be fitting and call her back before the shoot with the locations, and we discussed the price. Usually, my price is for the photos to be delivered digitally.  This was a referral from a close family friend so my mother had known this person for decades and told me that this was an older lady who most likely wanted prints. I called her back, asked her about prints, and threw her some numbers for some different sizes, and packages but since we hadn't shot yet, I told her it would be better if I sent them to her and she could decide which ones she wanted printed out and she agreed. On the day of the shoot I called her and told her the two locations we were going to be using, to which she told me she thought we were shooting at her house and that it would be more convenient to do so, HUGE disconnect there. Not too long after, I heard thunder and asked did she want to reschedule in case of rain plus the lighting outside was less than optimal for the look I go for, so that I can insure the level of quality that I like to bring to the table. She said no and that I should come anyways and try to do my best inside her house. I came, the rain finally cleared up, and luckily her house was less than 200 yards from a train track and a park that was on a river with a very picturesque dam. We shot pictures there, we came back to her house, I restated my price, Told her that I could show her the photos when they're done and we could discuss which ones she wanted printed and reiterated that it would be at an extra charge, and as we started to discuss that, her grandson(who I was shooting pictures of) told her that it was fine and that I could send the pictures to him and that he would get them printed. She said ok, I said ok, I got his email, and I'll send them to him when I'm done with the photos, she was fine with it, I was fine if she was fine, and I left the house. I got an angry call today (the day after the shoot), from the grandmother, asking me what she was supposed to get for what she paid. I told her that she would receive them digitally via her grandson and that he said he would print them out, as we agreed.

I find a lot of general assumptions or stereotypes regarding people who shoot nudes and I'd just like to share my side of the story. While changing someone's opinions is difficult I'd still want to share my thoughts on this.\n\n1. **Nude photographers are much rare compared to other genre of photographers:** People seem to target nude photography and photographers for bad photos. People make it sound like everyone is shooting nudes and they are fed up of it because it is constantly in their Instagram feed. But in reality there are a much higher number of photographers who shoot landscape, portraits. street. I come from a non-Western country and I have only found 3-4 photographers on Instagram from my country who do boudoir. And look it at like this, it is much easier to go out and shoot street or landscape(if you live in a beautiful place) than to shoot a nude woman. I find it a bit unfair when people target such photographers if they do not meet their artistic standards. While bad landscape, street, food photos go unnoticed. **As a photographer you're supposed to learn and get better with time. But it feels like many people just don't care about this when the person is shooting nudes.**\n2. **Nude photography often isn't easy**: I am not trying to question the difficulties faced by other  photographers because I am sure every photographer faces challenges when working on something but as someone who has photographed landscape and street before I feel photographing people is more difficult because **1.)** *You need models who fit your vision* **2.)** *Often they won't work for free unless you are working for a company or are famous* **3.)** *Then comes the part of arranging shoot locations etc*. Working with people is another challenge because sometimes they can piss you off. There have been couple of cases where I booked a shoot location but the model couldn't make it and I lost money. And at the end of all this sometimes some critics make it sound like there was no effort involved. And I'll be honest it hurts. **I would expect people who have never photographed to not understand what goes behind creating something but when I see other photographers doing it I am out of words.**\n3. **Nude Photographers exploit women:** This is a big one for me and I do not understand it. I think maybe there is a misunderstanding among people regarding how nude shoots work. A photographer can't just coerce someone to pose naked for them. It doesn't happen like I fix a shoot with a model and on the spot I tell her that now we're going to need a nude shot. The girl would just walk out. There are models who do nudes known as nude models that I reach out to, or who reach out to me. Also these models make it very clear the kind of photos they are okay with, many won't shoot pics involving spreading the legs etc. Many of these models have patreons or only fans too. And I'll be honest a lot of them earn higher than the average photographer and the top ones earn six figures in today's social media world. Some maybe even seven figures though those ones are a handful.\n\nI have seen several cases on Instagram where a nude model's Instagram was banned due to people reporting her pics. There was one with over 100k followers who created like 4 accounts and nearly gave up before Instagram reactivated her original account. **I talk with models a lot and believe me they are more dissapointed with such people and the people who are judging them rather than the photographer.** In fact photographers are some of the people that models especially nude models are usually comfortable with because both of them face similar issues like judgements from public.  Both know that the other person will at least not do that.\n\nI'm not denying that there exist people who harass their models. But this can happen in any setting which involves a woman working with a man. Sexual harassment in the workplace is a big issue and in 99% of the cases it doesn't involve naked women. Then why propagate the idea that just because the women are posing naked, they are being harassed? I feel people cannot see nudity and consent in the same frame.\n\nOn one or two occassions I have questioned myself if I really want to continue doing nude photography since it leaves a bad taste in my mouth sometimes despite the fact that a lot of people both male and female have appreciated and like my work. But I feel I have reached a point where I can give it up for any reason other than succumbing to people who judge my work.\n\n**PS:** There are a lot of people and photographers who actually do not care and can appreciate pics which involve nudity. In fact a lot of my irl friends are cool with it.

I suck at photography /!/   \n\nThis is a long one... but worth the read, I promise.  \n\nI'll preface this by saying that I'm a professional portrait photographer, so in theory I should know my way around the camera. I was recently in a location with VERY low light pollution (class 2), overlooking a lake and mountains, no cloud cover, and a new moon. Absolutely perfect conditions for astrophotography nightscapes. I've done some astrophotography before, so I know what I'm doing, in theory at least. Night shooting is a BIG commitment for me, because regardless of how late I stay up, my kids still get up at 6am, but the conditions were worth it. Here is how it went\u2026\n\n**First mistake... yup, I made THAT mistake**\n\nWhen the sky was getting dark enough, I pulled out my camera to get setup. From memory, I set the camera up for astrophotography. I started at about ISO 6400, f2.8 13s 14mm. Turned off NR and IBIS. Took the first photo, nothing but some small faint dots. \"Is that noise or stars?\" Jacked the ISO WAY up... same results, but now the dots are slightly more pronounced and colored. \"That looks a lot like noise, but maybe they are stars.\" By this point I could see the milky way band with my naked eye, so I knew the camera should be able to see it. I checked my notebook for the settings... everything in the camera should be set right. After about 15 minutes fiddling with the camera and settings I realized that.... yup, I left the lens cap on. I suck.\n\n**Second mistake - foreground**\n\nOnce I got the lens cap off and actually started shooting, the shoot went great. I took a few 10-shot series for image stacking. The photos looked great in the back of the camera. I had a few locations that I wanted to get to, so I moved on pretty quickly. Also, I was on the side of a road and things were getting a little creepy. When reviewing the images the next day, I realized that the foreground was COMPLETELY out of focus. When I was shooting, I (wrongly) assumed that by focusing on the stars at f2.8, the foreground would be in good enough focus for a nightscape... I was wrong. The photos looks awful. I should have took a few extra shots for focus stacking. \n\n**Last mistake - the big one**\n\nThe final shot was to be the coup de gr\u00e2ce. It was going to be a 1.5 hour long star trail shot overlooking a lake and mountains. The star trails would be visible in both the lake and the sky. It looked amazing (in my head).  After getting the framing and exposure perfect, I took a test shot. Checked the histogram for exposure and zoomed in on a star to check focus. All perfect. I set the intervalometer for 1.5 hours of exposures and hit the shutter button. The first photo took and I went inside for a bit. (it was now about 12:30pm, getting late for me). I came back out about 30 minutes later to check on everything. The camera was black and in sleep mode. After poking around for a bit, I realized that I set the intervalometer, but forgot to turn it on (nice going idiot). \n\nSo, this time I set turned the intervalometer on, hit the shutter and watched to make sure a few photos took. After an hour and a half the camera finished up, I collected my gear, went in side and went to bed, I was exhausted. The next morning, I excitedly showed my wife the photos on the back of the camera.

(it was now about 12:30pm, getting late for me). i came back out about 30 minutes later to check on everything. the camera was black and in sleep mode. after poking around for a bit, i realized that i set the intervalometer, but forgot to turn it on (nice going idiot). \n\nso, this time i set turned the intervalometer on, hit the shutter and watched to make sure a few photos took. after an hour and a half the camera finished up, i collected my gear, went in side and went to bed, i was exhausted. the next morning, i excitedly showed my wife the photos on the back of the camera. the single images of the star-trail series looked great. the milky-way was bright and defined. i then uploaded them to my computer and reviewed. the stars in the last photo were completely out of focus (weird), and the one before it, and 10 before that, and all of them, except the very first test shot. wtf! i\u2019m assuming that i bumped the focus ring between the test shot and the full series. the entire series was unusable. \n\nafter saying up all night all shooting nightscapes, in multiple locations, i got exactly 1 image that i\u2019m happy with. i suck! photography always find a way to keep you humble.  that said, i can\u2019t wait for the next nightscape shoot!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 64975, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 63531, "autor": "Young983", "date": 1596400977000, "content": "Best location for a day out", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/i2jcfd/best_location_for_a_day_out/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "best -----> location !!!  for a day out", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 65085, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 63608, "autor": "katzgar", "date": 1602004674000, "content": "Pixel 3A and glitter /!/ I'm trying to take pictures of jewelry with glitter on it and the Pixel 3A is washing out the glitter so it doesn't show does anybody have any suggestions I've tried light from different locations I've tried a little video and nothing seems to be helping", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/j6965b/pixel_3a_and_glitter/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "locations", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "pixel 3a and glitter /!/ i'm trying to take pictures of jewelry with glitter on it and the pixel 3a is washing out the glitter so it doesn't show does anybody have any suggestions i've tried light from different -----> locations !!!  i've tried a little video and nothing seems to be helping", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 65163, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 63849, "autor": "Urbex_Badger", "date": 1607594414000, "content": "AI photo editing kills photographic talents.

I will be writing from my scientific and technical background and will therefore present the quantitative and empirical measurements of sharpness that are most accessible along with example photos, and let you make your own judgments about perceived sharpness.\n\nI\u2019m going to start by simply sharing side-by-side comparisons of an original digital photo taken on a 24 MP sensor next to a copy that has been processed to simulate the resolution of various film stocks. **To be clear, I have only simulated the ability of the film to resolve detail; I have not simulated color, grain, halation, or other film effects**.

What matters more for photography? That depends on the application. For a print hanging on a wall, definitely the perceived sharpness matters more, as the photo will be viewed from a distance.\n\nThe original photo used in the simulations and used for comparison was taken with a Carl Zeiss Jena 50mm f/2.8 Tessar at f/5.6 at ISO 400 on a Canon DSLR. It was color corrected, but not sharpened and the texture/clarity sliders weren\u2019t used. It\u2019s not a great photo, but it is one of the sharpest and most detailed images in my library.\n\nIn my opinion, all of these simulations have plenty of resolution for prints up to 15\u201d at least. The TMax simulation is probably good to print up to 30\u201d, and is nearly as sharp as the original!\n\nOne detail that I left out is that the original photo was actually taken on a 1.6x crop sensor (Canon 80D). For the sake of the simulation, I \u201cpretended\u201d that it was a full frame photo. If we simulate the same photo taken on a crop frame of the sharpest of the color films, Velvia 100, it looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/2PMD8Yd.jpg), and here's the [side-by side](https://i.imgur.com/8kvxvOm.jpg). The lateral resolution is effectively lowered by the crop factor, but I didn't do this just by resizing the photo, I simulated it as though it were a smaller frame and rendered it at the same digital (pixel) resolution as the original photo.\n\nLet me know in the comments which of these (excluding the crop simulation) looks like the sharpest and which one looks the softest, I'm curious if there will be variety in the answers! Now I'll move on to the details. This is the long part, and it involves a little math.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nLet me begin by defining the way I use the words *image* and *photo* in this post. When I refer to an *image*, I am talking about the exact pattern of light that a photographic lens focuses onto the sensor/film. When I refer to a *photo* or *picture*, I am talking about the recording of the image that is made by the sensor/film. You can think of the image as being the physical, real representation of the scene you are trying to capture projected by the lens, and the photo as a data recording of that image.\n\nThe reason for making this distinction is that, whatever medium you use, there is a loss of information in the transcription of the image to the photo (note: the image itself is a lossy representation of the real scene because 1) the concept of depth has been lost (the image is a 2D projection of a 3D scene) and 2) the lens doesn\u2019t do a perfect job.) The photo will be discussed in this post in terms of it being a piece of data. After all, once it makes it onto your computer, it\u2019s basically a grid of numbers, each number representing the intensity of red, green, or blue light which fell onto a particular pixel (this is an oversimplification due to the specific way that non-Foveon sensors record color images). And for film, the data is recorded as a pattern of metallic silver particles, which were converted by light from being transparent, dye-sensitized silver halide crystals. In principle, one could perform a very sophisticated IR microspectroscopy experiment and measure the location of each individual metallic silver particle (and in color film, which color layer it is embedded in) and recreate an image digitally based on that recorded data; but in practice this would take days per scan, so we just use an image scanner to \u201ctake a picture\u201d of the film.\n\n**FOURIER TRANSFORMS**\n\nTo understand the way that film resolution has been simulated above, it is first necessary to understand the mathematical concept of the Fourier transform. [Here is a good youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) that explains it at length. I would also direct you to the Wikipedia page on the subject, or even just [this animation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/27HVo.gif). But let me summarize: The fundamental concept of signal analysis is the idea that any signal or any data series can be represented as a sum of a series of sine and cosine waves with different oscillation amplitude A and different oscillation frequency f. When you calculate the Fourier transform of a piece of data, you are explicitly calculating the amplitude A that corresponds to any given frequency, in other words to find a function called A(f), the amplitude of the data set\u2019s constituent sine waves as a function of the wave\u2019s frequency.\n\nIn the case of a photo, which is a 2D data set, the Fourier transform decomposes the photo into a series of sine waves which oscillate along the horizontal direction and a series of sines waves which oscillate along the vertical direction. The Fourier transform therefore produces a function A(fx,fy) where fx, fy are the frequencies along the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nLow frequencies of oscillation correspond to large features in the photo, while high frequencies of oscillation correspond to fine detail. It is useful to talk about the frequencies in photos in units of cycles per mm (in photographic jargon, that might be called lines per mm or line pairs per mm). That is to say, according to the size of the original photo (36x24mm for 135 film or full frame sensors), how many oscillations of the sine wave take place over the span of 1mm. The smaller the number of cycles per mm, the larger the detail. The larger the number of cycles per mm, the finer the detail.\n\nSee for example this pair of simulated full frame, 36x24mm photos: [The first one](https://i.imgur.com/vOAuNFW.jpg) is a photo of a sine wave, represented in black and white, with a frequency of 1 cycle/mm. If you count them, you\u2019ll find that it has 36 black bars and 36 white bars. Since it's representing a frame that is 36 mm wide, that means it has 1 cycle per mm. [The second one](https://i.imgur.com/i712r4k.png) is a photo of a sine wave with a frequency of 3 cycles/mm, and so it has 3 x 36 = 108 black bars and 108 white bars. So what does a Fourier transform of a photo look like?\n\n[Here is a photo that is composed primarily of large features](https://i.imgur.com/oRXLLok.jpg). The light on the wall is a smooth gradient, and the lamp fills much of the frame and doesn\u2019t have a lot of texture or detail. [Here is its fast Fourier transform](https://i.imgur.com/y92jL0p.jpg) (FFT\u2014a specific algorithm for computing Fourier transforms), with the spatial frequencies in cycles per mm written along the axes. The upper right corner corresponds to low spatial frequencies along the horizontal and vertical direction, and the lower right corner corresponds to high spatial frequencies. Brighter yellows correspond to the dominant frequencies, while darker blues correspond to frequencies which are mostly absent from the photo.\n\nOn the other hand, [here is a photo with lots of fine details](https://i.imgur.com/htO2AOP.jpg), and [here is its Fourier transform](https://i.imgur.com/0OKsmfp.jpg). Notice that compared to the lamp photo, there is less structure and less intensity in the upper right corner (low frequencies) of the FFT plot and more intensity in the middle and bottom right, corresponding to more dominant fine features in the photo.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that a Fourier transform can be reversed, though an operation called an inverse Fourier transform. If we perform the inverse Fourier transform on the Fourier transformed photo of the lamp, [the original photo will be recovered with almost perfect fidelity](https://i.imgur.com/du8rVqQ.jpg). In fact, you probably won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between the original and the inverse transformed photo.\n\nAt this point, you might have noticed that the photos being used for examples are black and white. Black and white photos make for a simpler example, but to extend the concept to color photos, all you need to do is compute the Fourier transforms of the red, green, and blue channels separately.[Here\u2019s a photo that has lots of fine detail in red](https://i.imgur.com/o7MSDsI.jpg), but dominantly very coarse detail in blue. Now here is the [color FFT](https://i.imgur.com/7Une2ru.jpg), which is basically an FFT plot made by combining the separate FFTs of the red, green, and blue channels of the original photo into a new red/green/blue color photo. Notice that the low frequency data (upper right) has a blueish hue, while the high frequency data has a reddish hue, as one would expect from the broad feature of the blue sky and fine red features of the tree leaves.\n\n**SIMULATING FILM RESOLUTION**\n\nNow, finally, on to sharpness and resolution. A photo that is soft and lacking in fine detail, whether due to blur or low resolution, is going to have basically no content in the high frequency part of the FFT. This also means that we can make a photo softer and blurrier by removing the high frequency components from its FFT, like I've done [here](https://i.imgur.com/N5ewQfC.jpg) to the FFT of the red tree (black = 0, data deleted). After computing the inverse FFT to turn it back into a normal image, it now [looks like this,](https://i.imgur.com/Gvp5SbV.jpg) much blurrier! You\u2019ll also notice that edges in the photo have weird oscillating distortions outlining them. This is known as the Gibbs phenomenon in signal processing, and occurs whenever you have an abrupt frequency cutoff in your signal.\n\nWe now introduce the modulation transfer function, or MTF. This is a general concept from signal analysis which characterizes a measurement\u2019s frequency dependent response to the input data, and is also some times called a response function. More plainly said, any measurement device (i.e. a camera\u2019s image sensor or photographic film) responds differently to different data frequencies. In general, most instruments lose their sensitivity as frequencies increase. This is the case for photographic systems. Your digital sensor certainly can\u2019t resolve detail that is smaller than pixels, and for a variety of reasons, film generally can\u2019t resolve detail that is smaller than about 0.01mm in size on the film plane (but this varies quite a lot from film to film). The characterization of an instrument\u2019s frequency dependent sensitivity is its MTF. [Here is a compilation of MTFs from a few common film stocks](https://i.imgur.com/nEd4Auw.jpg). These charts can be found by google searching for \u201c\\[film name\\] MTF\u201d, and the MTF for most Kodak and Fuji professional films are supplied by the manufacturers.\n\nThe way to interpret a film MTF curve is as follows: Imagine you use a *perfect* lens to take a photo of a series of perfectly black and perfectly white stripes (and you nail the exposure). Then you very carefully measure the difference in opacity of the film between the bright and dark stripes (using a technique called densitometry), and calculate the contrast ratio (bright divided by dark). You then repeat this for black and white bars of various widths/spacings, and make a graph of contrast ratio vs. the width/spacing of the bars, with the contrast ratio of a fully white and fully black exposed frame defined as being 1 or 100%. This is essentially the MTF. What is done in practice, however, is that the MTF is calculated by imaging a pattern of bars (or sine waves) in which the spacing/width gradually increases across the frame. [This](https://i.imgur.com/jrYs1CH.jpg) is what such a pattern looks like before accounting for a film\u2019s loss of sensitivity to fine detail (1 cycle/mm on the left, 140 cycles/mm on the right), and [this](https://i.imgur.com/ZQMvdkL.jpg)is what it looks like simulating the sensitivity of Kodak T-Max 100. (NOTE: for these test strip images, you have to zoom WAY in to see the stripes at the right edge). The contrast ratio is simply measured across the film strip at various points and plotted out to calculate the MTF. Alternatively, the MTF can be calculated by performing a 1D Fourier transform of a digitized version of the film strip.\n\nThe film simulations in this post are done by first digitizing the manufacturer provided MTF curve, then multiplying it by the Fourier transform of a photo, and finally performing the inverse FFT on that product. That process is illustrated [here](https://i.imgur.com/gioWyzq.png): in the left frame is the 2D version of the ektachrome MTF, and in the middle is the FFT of the hill photo. On the right is the product of the two, and as you can see, the bottom right corner of the product, which corresponds to fine detail, is somewhat darker; we have thrown away high detail information from the photo by multiplying it by a lossy film MTF. The result after taking the inverse fourier transform is a very specific type of blur applied to the photo, the exact form of which depends on the film stock\u2019s MTF. It\u2019s not exactly a Gaussian blur, although when you perform a Gaussian blur in photoshop it does essentially use this exact process, only using a Gaussian-shaped MTF.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that for some of the above MTF curves shown earlier, the MTF values exceed 100% at certain spatial frequencies. This is due to grain structure. Grain tends to emphasize detail that occurs at the exact same size/spatial frequency of the grain itself. Film grain size is not fixed; there\u2019s a wide range of grain sizes occurring on a given films stock, so there\u2019s generally a range of spatial frequencies which are emphasized and enhanced by grain. That effect is captured by the MTF and therefore by the above simulations. Basically, by setting the high frequency part of the MTF to a value above 100%, sharpening occurs. This is also how your computer performs sharpening operations in lightroom/PS/etc. There are other types of sharpening which are more sophisticated, but this is the basic version.\n\n**QUANTIFYING DETAIL**\n\nA measure of the detail contained in a piece of data that is frequently used in information science and signal processing is its entropy. The definition of entropy is complex, and it\u2019s not especially intuitive, but the larger the value of the entropy, the more fine detail it contains. Below is a table of calculated log(entropy) for the different film simulations. Please note that an entropy difference of even 1% represents a huge change in the level of detail, because entropy is presented on a logarithmic scale.\n\n|Original photo (color)|7.62|\n|:-|:-|\n|Portra 160|7.53|\n|Portra 400|7.61|\n|Portra 800|7.41|\n|Velvia 50|7.61|\n|Velvia 100|7.61|\n|Pro 400H|7.53|\n|Ektar 100|7.55|\n|Ektachrome e100|7.57|\n|Original photo|7.50|\n|TMax 100|7.50|\n\nThere are some unintuitive results in this table. For example, the entropy of Portra 400 is higher than Portra 160. My guess as to the reason for this is that the MTF of Portra 400 is actually slightly higher than that of Portra 160 at 20 cycles/ mm, and most likely there\u2019s a lot of detail in this photo at roughly the 20 cycles/mm mark which is enhanced by Portra 400. Another unintuitive result is that the entropy of Portra 400, Velvia 50/100 are almost identical to the original photo (the original photo edges them out by only about a part in ten thousand). I believe that this is, again, because the MTF curves of these films generally exceed 1 in the 15-30 cycles/mm range where the photo has a lot of detail. Hence they have a bit of a sharpening effect. That isn\u2019t completely obvious in the side by side comparisons because there is a lot of extremely fine detail which gets blurred out in the film simulations. But for the actual structure of the photo, the leaves and rocks and tufts of grass, that 15-30 cycles/mm range is very important. So, pixel peeping aside, I think that entropy does a good job of capturing perceived sharpness. Lastly, the MTF curve of TMax-100 is quite impressive and remains above 1 all the way up to 50 cycles/mm!\n\n**SIDE NOTES**\n\nAll computations and simulations were performed in Matlab. Film MTF curves were digitized manually and interpolated with a cubic algorithm in a fully logarithmic space. The curves were extrapolated out to 200 cycles/mm with a linear function (linear within the log-log space). For MTF curves supplied with per-channel data, the curves were independently digitized and then averaged in the log-log space.\n\nA note regarding the units of cycles per mm, lines per mm, and line pairs per mm: It is often the case that lines per mm and line pairs per mm are used interchangeably, but the astute reader will have noticed that there should technically be a factor of two difference between the two. Which of these two measures is more indicative of resolution? That's situation dependent. Line pairs per mm is perhaps more useful when talking about a subject where detail comes through in texture. To resolve individual grains of sand on a beach, it is necessary to see the faint shadow which outlines each grain of sand, and each grain of sand is defined by a bright spot and a dark edge; thus to resolve a single grain of sand, the grain of sand must be at least as large as the minimum resolvable line pair. Lines per mm, dots per inch, or perhaps you might think of this as the size of individual pixels on a sensor, are more indicative of resolution when detail is defined by hard edges, by transitions between continuous bodies in the composition which have significant contrast between them. A good example of this might be a photo of a tree where the leaves are large enough to take up many pixels (or many \"lines\" or \"dots\") and stand out against a contrasting background; in this case, the leaf will appear sharp if the transition between leaf and background is as abrupt as possible, which in terms of line pairs or cycles, corresponds to the *transition* between the light line and the dark line.\n\nI am far, far, far from a photography expert. I\u2019ve only been seriously interested in photography for about a year, and in film photography for six months. The experience I will draw from instead is my experience as an optical physicist. My research concerns optical microscopy, high resolution spectroscopy, and super-resolution imaging of defects in 2-dimensional semiconductors and nanoscale magnetic domain walls in 2-dimensional magnets. The specific concepts that I have discussed above, which many readers may know of as concepts from photography, are actually quite general and are ideas that imaging science borrowed from the more general theory of *signal processing*, which is central in optics, electronics, and information science. So, while I may not have much specific experience in photography, I hope that I can use my relevant experience in optics, signal processing, and imaging to explore the topic of resolution and sharpness in an informative and interesting way.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/fwl79n/simulating_film_resolution_and_sharpness_of/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "simulating film resolution and sharpness of popular film socks /!/ this is a very long post, but the main results are tabulated near the top.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nmy goal with this post is to explore how common film stocks compare in resolution to modern digital sensors and to each other. the subjects of resolution and sharpness are vast, and quantifying *perceived* sharpness and resolution can be difficult if not impossible. u/tach has suggested a couple resources, *image clarity* by john b. williams and *basic photographic materials and processes* by nanette salvaggio. i will be writing from my scientific and technical background and will therefore present the quantitative and empirical measurements of sharpness that are most accessible along with example photos, and let you make your own judgments about perceived sharpness.\n\ni\u2019m going to start by simply sharing side-by-side comparisons of an original digital photo taken on a 24 mp sensor next to a copy that has been processed to simulate the resolution of various film stocks. **to be clear, i have only simulated the ability of the film to resolve detail; i have not simulated color, grain, halation, or other film effects**. the idea is that if i took the exact same photo on film, with the exact same lens and exact same conditions, then did a \\*perfect\\* scan of the film and color-corrected it to look the same as the digital photo, they would look like the simulated photos (neglecting grain and halation). after the sample photos, i will explain how i performed these simulations and do some more detailed analysis. tabulated below are full resolution photos along with side-by-side comparisons with the original at a 100% crop.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n|*film stock*|full size simulation|100% crop comparison|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|digital/original|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/cyfggnh.jpg)|n/a|\n|black and white original|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/bn5s4gs.jpg)|n/a|\n|ektachrome e100|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/xn6ilbp.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/esgbsrt.jpg)|\n|ektar 100|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/g7azp5v.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/h6hg0qj.jpg)|\n|portra 160|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/jbhskmx.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/gcr2sq5.jpg)|\n|portra 400|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/4ogcvpb.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/irln7tu.jpg)|\n|portra 800|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/470i0mi.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/knazird.jpg)|\n|pro 400h|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/9do5ypn.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/6u4iahq.jpg)|\n|velvia 50|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/70wys9z.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/au9vbaq.jpg)|\n|velvia 100|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/dpfimcg.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zdkjlmd.jpg)|\n|tmax 100|[full size](https://i.imgur.com/mcguhit.jpg)|[100% crop/comparison](https://i.imgur.com/qxo2zlz.jpg)|\n\nyou may find that some film simulation photos, zoomed out, look at least as sharp or sharper than the original, but at 100% look distinctly less detailed. **more on that below.** this is the distinction between perceived sharpness and technical, empirical sharpness. what matters more for photography? that depends on the application. for a print hanging on a wall, definitely the perceived sharpness matters more, as the photo will be viewed from a distance.\n\nthe original photo used in the simulations and used for comparison was taken with a carl zeiss jena 50mm f/2.8 tessar at f/5.6 at iso 400 on a canon dslr. it was color corrected, but not sharpened and the texture/clarity sliders weren\u2019t used. it\u2019s not a great photo, but it is one of the sharpest and most detailed images in my library.\n\nin my opinion, all of these simulations have plenty of resolution for prints up to 15\u201d at least. the tmax simulation is probably good to print up to 30\u201d, and is nearly as sharp as the original!\n\none detail that i left out is that the original photo was actually taken on a 1.6x crop sensor (canon 80d). for the sake of the simulation, i \u201cpretended\u201d that it was a full frame photo. if we simulate the same photo taken on a crop frame of the sharpest of the color films, velvia 100, it looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/2pmd8yd.jpg), and here's the [side-by side](https://i.imgur.com/8kvxvom.jpg). the lateral resolution is effectively lowered by the crop factor, but i didn't do this just by resizing the photo, i simulated it as though it were a smaller frame and rendered it at the same digital (pixel) resolution as the original photo.\n\nlet me know in the comments which of these (excluding the crop simulation) looks like the sharpest and which one looks the softest, i'm curious if there will be variety in the answers! now i'll move on to the details. this is the long part, and it involves a little math.\n\n**introduction**\n\nlet me begin by defining the way i use the words *image* and *photo* in this post. when i refer to an *image*, i am talking about the exact pattern of light that a photographic lens focuses onto the sensor/film. when i refer to a *photo* or *picture*, i am talking about the recording of the image that is made by the sensor/film. you can think of the image as being the physical, real representation of the scene you are trying to capture projected by the lens, and the photo as a data recording of that image.\n\nthe reason for making this distinction is that, whatever medium you use, there is a loss of information in the transcription of the image to the photo (note: the image itself is a lossy representation of the real scene because 1) the concept of depth has been lost (the image is a 2d projection of a 3d scene) and 2) the lens doesn\u2019t do a perfect job.) the photo will be discussed in this post in terms of it being a piece of data. after all, once it makes it onto your computer, it\u2019s basically a grid of numbers, each number representing the intensity of red, green, or blue light which fell onto a particular pixel (this is an oversimplification due to the specific way that non-foveon sensors record color images). and for film, the data is recorded as a pattern of metallic silver particles, which were converted by light from being transparent, dye-sensitized silver halide crystals. in principle, one could perform a very sophisticated ir microspectroscopy experiment and measure the -----> location !!!  of each individual metallic silver particle (and in color film, which color layer it is embedded in) and recreate an image digitally based on that recorded data; but in practice this would take days per scan, so we just use an image scanner to \u201ctake a picture\u201d of the film.\n\n**fourier transforms**\n\nto understand the way that film resolution has been simulated above, it is first necessary to understand the mathematical concept of the fourier transform. [here is a good youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spunpyf58by) that explains it at length. i would also direct you to the wikipedia page on the subject, or even just [this animation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/27hvo.gif). but let me summarize: the fundamental concept of signal analysis is the idea that any signal or any data series can be represented as a sum of a series of sine and cosine waves with different oscillation amplitude a and different oscillation frequency f. when you calculate the fourier transform of a piece of data, you are explicitly calculating the amplitude a that corresponds to any given frequency, in other words to find a function called a(f), the amplitude of the data set\u2019s constituent sine waves as a function of the wave\u2019s frequency.\n\nin the case of a photo, which is a 2d data set, the fourier transform decomposes the photo into a series of sine waves which oscillate along the horizontal direction and a series of sines waves which oscillate along the vertical direction. the fourier transform therefore produces a function a(fx,fy) where fx, fy are the frequencies along the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nlow frequencies of oscillation correspond to large features in the photo, while high frequencies of oscillation correspond to fine detail. it is useful to talk about the frequencies in photos in units of cycles per mm (in photographic jargon, that might be called lines per mm or line pairs per mm). that is to say, according to the size of the original photo (36x24mm for 135 film or full frame sensors), how many oscillations of the sine wave take place over the span of 1mm. the smaller the number of cycles per mm, the larger the detail. the larger the number of cycles per mm, the finer the detail.\n\nsee for example this pair of simulated full frame, 36x24mm photos: [the first one](https://i.imgur.com/voaunfw.jpg) is a photo of a sine wave, represented in black and white, with a frequency of 1 cycle/mm. if you count them, you\u2019ll find that it has 36 black bars and 36 white bars. since it's representing a frame that is 36 mm wide, that means it has 1 cycle per mm. [the second one](https://i.imgur.com/i712r4k.png) is a photo of a sine wave with a frequency of 3 cycles/mm, and so it has 3 x 36 = 108 black bars and 108 white bars. so what does a fourier transform of a photo look like?\n\n[here is a photo that is composed primarily of large features](https://i.imgur.com/orxllok.jpg). the light on the wall is a smooth gradient, and the lamp fills much of the frame and doesn\u2019t have a lot of texture or detail. [here is its fast fourier transform](https://i.imgur.com/y92jl0p.jpg) (fft\u2014a specific algorithm for computing fourier transforms), with the spatial frequencies in cycles per mm written along the axes. the upper right corner corresponds to low spatial frequencies along the horizontal and vertical direction, and the lower right corner corresponds to high spatial frequencies. brighter yellows correspond to the dominant frequencies, while darker blues correspond to frequencies which are mostly absent from the photo.\n\non the other hand, [here is a photo with lots of fine details](https://i.imgur.com/hto2aop.jpg), and [here is its fourier transform](https://i.imgur.com/0oksmfp.jpg). notice that compared to the lamp photo, there is less structure and less intensity in the upper right corner (low frequencies) of the fft plot and more intensity in the middle and bottom right, corresponding to more dominant fine features in the photo.\n\nit\u2019s also worth noting that a fourier transform can be reversed, though an operation called an inverse fourier transform. if we perform the inverse fourier transform on the fourier transformed photo of the lamp, [the original photo will be recovered with almost perfect fidelity](https://i.imgur.com/du8rvqq.jpg). in fact, you probably won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between the original and the inverse transformed photo.\n\nat this point, you might have noticed that the photos being used for examples are black and white. black and white photos make for a simpler example, but to extend the concept to color photos, all you need to do is compute the fourier transforms of the red, green, and blue channels separately.[here\u2019s a photo that has lots of fine detail in red](https://i.imgur.com/o7msdsi.jpg), but dominantly very coarse detail in blue. now here is the [color fft](https://i.imgur.com/7une2ru.jpg), which is basically an fft plot made by combining the separate ffts of the red, green, and blue channels of the original photo into a new red/green/blue color photo. notice that the low frequency data (upper right) has a blueish hue, while the high frequency data has a reddish hue, as one would expect from the broad feature of the blue sky and fine red features of the tree leaves.\n\n**simulating film resolution**\n\nnow, finally, on to sharpness and resolution. a photo that is soft and lacking in fine detail, whether due to blur or low resolution, is going to have basically no content in the high frequency part of the fft. this also means that we can make a photo softer and blurrier by removing the high frequency components from its fft, like i've done [here](https://i.imgur.com/n5ewqfc.jpg) to the fft of the red tree (black = 0, data deleted). after computing the inverse fft to turn it back into a normal image, it now [looks like this,](https://i.imgur.com/gvp5sbv.jpg) much blurrier! you\u2019ll also notice that edges in the photo have weird oscillating distortions outlining them. this is known as the gibbs phenomenon in signal processing, and occurs whenever you have an abrupt frequency cutoff in your signal.\n\nwe now introduce the modulation transfer function, or mtf. this is a general concept from signal analysis which characterizes a measurement\u2019s frequency dependent response to the input data, and is also some times called a response function. more plainly said, any measurement device (i.e. a camera\u2019s image sensor or photographic film) responds differently to different data frequencies. in general, most instruments lose their sensitivity as frequencies increase. this is the case for photographic systems. your digital sensor certainly can\u2019t resolve detail that is smaller than pixels, and for a variety of reasons, film generally can\u2019t resolve detail that is smaller than about 0.01mm in size on the film plane (but this varies quite a lot from film to film). the characterization of an instrument\u2019s frequency dependent sensitivity is its mtf.

[this](https://i.imgur.com/jrys1ch.jpg) is what such a pattern looks like before accounting for a film\u2019s loss of sensitivity to fine detail (1 cycle/mm on the left, 140 cycles/mm on the right), and [this](https://i.imgur.com/zqmvdkl.jpg)is what it looks like simulating the sensitivity of kodak t-max 100. (note: for these test strip images, you have to zoom way in to see the stripes at the right edge). the contrast ratio is simply measured across the film strip at various points and plotted out to calculate the mtf. alternatively, the mtf can be calculated by performing a 1d fourier transform of a digitized version of the film strip.\n\nthe film simulations in this post are done by first digitizing the manufacturer provided mtf curve, then multiplying it by the fourier transform of a photo, and finally performing the inverse fft on that product. that process is illustrated [here](https://i.imgur.com/giowyzq.png): in the left frame is the 2d version of the ektachrome mtf, and in the middle is the fft of the hill photo. on the right is the product of the two, and as you can see, the bottom right corner of the product, which corresponds to fine detail, is somewhat darker; we have thrown away high detail information from the photo by multiplying it by a lossy film mtf. the result after taking the inverse fourier transform is a very specific type of blur applied to the photo, the exact form of which depends on the film stock\u2019s mtf. it\u2019s not exactly a gaussian blur, although when you perform a gaussian blur in photoshop it does essentially use this exact process, only using a gaussian-shaped mtf.\n\nyou\u2019ll notice that for some of the above mtf curves shown earlier, the mtf values exceed 100% at certain spatial frequencies. this is due to grain structure. grain tends to emphasize detail that occurs at the exact same size/spatial frequency of the grain itself. film grain size is not fixed; there\u2019s a wide range of grain sizes occurring on a given films stock, so there\u2019s generally a range of spatial frequencies which are emphasized and enhanced by grain. that effect is captured by the mtf and therefore by the above simulations. basically, by setting the high frequency part of the mtf to a value above 100%, sharpening occurs. this is also how your computer performs sharpening operations in lightroom/ps/etc. there are other types of sharpening which are more sophisticated, but this is the basic version.\n\n**quantifying detail**\n\na measure of the detail contained in a piece of data that is frequently used in information science and signal processing is its entropy. the definition of entropy is complex, and it\u2019s not especially intuitive, but the larger the value of the entropy, the more fine detail it contains. below is a table of calculated log(entropy) for the different film simulations. please note that an entropy difference of even 1% represents a huge change in the level of detail, because entropy is presented on a logarithmic scale.\n\n|original photo (color)|7.62|\n|:-|:-|\n|portra 160|7.53|\n|portra 400|7.61|\n|portra 800|7.41|\n|velvia 50|7.61|\n|velvia 100|7.61|\n|pro 400h|7.53|\n|ektar 100|7.55|\n|ektachrome e100|7.57|\n|original photo|7.50|\n|tmax 100|7.50|\n\nthere are some unintuitive results in this table. for example, the entropy of portra 400 is higher than portra 160. my guess as to the reason for this is that the mtf of portra 400 is actually slightly higher than that of portra 160 at 20 cycles/ mm, and most likely there\u2019s a lot of detail in this photo at roughly the 20 cycles/mm mark which is enhanced by portra 400. another unintuitive result is that the entropy of portra 400, velvia 50/100 are almost identical to the original photo (the original photo edges them out by only about a part in ten thousand). i believe that this is, again, because the mtf curves of these films generally exceed 1 in the 15-30 cycles/mm range where the photo has a lot of detail. hence they have a bit of a sharpening effect. that isn\u2019t completely obvious in the side by side comparisons because there is a lot of extremely fine detail which gets blurred out in the film simulations. but for the actual structure of the photo, the leaves and rocks and tufts of grass, that 15-30 cycles/mm range is very important. so, pixel peeping aside, i think that entropy does a good job of capturing perceived sharpness. lastly, the mtf curve of tmax-100 is quite impressive and remains above 1 all the way up to 50 cycles/mm!\n\n**side notes**\n\nall computations and simulations were performed in matlab. film mtf curves were digitized manually and interpolated with a cubic algorithm in a fully logarithmic space. the curves were extrapolated out to 200 cycles/mm with a linear function (linear within the log-log space). for mtf curves supplied with per-channel data, the curves were independently digitized and then averaged in the log-log space.\n\na note regarding the units of cycles per mm, lines per mm, and line pairs per mm: it is often the case that lines per mm and line pairs per mm are used interchangeably, but the astute reader will have noticed that there should technically be a factor of two difference between the two. which of these two measures is more indicative of resolution? that's situation dependent. line pairs per mm is perhaps more useful when talking about a subject where detail comes through in texture. to resolve individual grains of sand on a beach, it is necessary to see the faint shadow which outlines each grain of sand, and each grain of sand is defined by a bright spot and a dark edge; thus to resolve a single grain of sand, the grain of sand must be at least as large as the minimum resolvable line pair. lines per mm, dots per inch, or perhaps you might think of this as the size of individual pixels on a sensor, are more indicative of resolution when detail is defined by hard edges, by transitions between continuous bodies in the composition which have significant contrast between them. a good example of this might be a photo of a tree where the leaves are large enough to take up many pixels (or many \"lines\" or \"dots\") and stand out against a contrasting background; in this case, the leaf will appear sharp if the transition between leaf and background is as abrupt as possible, which in terms of line pairs or cycles, corresponds to the *transition* between the light line and the dark line.\n\ni am far, far, far from a photography expert. i\u2019ve only been seriously interested in photography for about a year, and in film photography for six months. the experience i will draw from instead is my experience as an optical physicist. my research concerns optical microscopy, high resolution spectroscopy, and super-resolution imaging of defects in 2-dimensional semiconductors and nanoscale magnetic domain walls in 2-dimensional magnets. the specific concepts that i have discussed above, which many readers may know of as concepts from photography, are actually quite general and are ideas that imaging science borrowed from the more general theory of *signal processing*, which is central in optics, electronics, and information science. so, while i may not have much specific experience in photography, i hope that i can use my relevant experience in optics, signal processing, and imaging to explore the topic of resolution and sharpness in an informative and interesting way.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 67435, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 66191, "autor": "[deleted]", "date": 1587019681000, "content": "Favorite everyday locations?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/g29ugu/favorite_everyday_locations/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "locations", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "favorite everyday -----> locations !!! ?", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 67821, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 66556, "autor": "jamesabels", "date": 1579583501000, "content": "Just released an early alpha build of EXIF Hound, a pay what you want, image metadata tool.

If this is the wrong sub for this question I apologize, but hopefully this is relevant to a lot of people on the sub. \n\nLike many people with a smartphone, I take a couple dozen photos/videos on my phone (Android) every day for various reasons. The \"Big 3\" reasons I take pictures are for my job, friends/family, and taking videos of my workouts.

Here's what I do:\n\nI have 3 different camera apps on my phone and each one is set up to save to a different folder: \n\n* Camera App #1 saves all pictures/videos to a \"Work\" folder on my phone, which then FolderSync then syncs to a Google Drive folder associated with my work email address.\n* Camera App #2 saves all pictures/videos to a \"Friends&amp;Family\" folder, which FolderSync then syncs to a Google Drive folder (GDrive Friends &amp; Family) that is associated with my personal email address.\n* Camera App #3 saves all pictures/videos to a \"Workout\" folder, which FolderSync then syncs to a different Google drive folder (GDrive Workout) that is also associated with me personal email address.\n\nSo, I pre-sort my photos by taking pictures using a different camera app for each category and tie it all together with FolderSync.

Try assisting! Here's how! /!/ I've been assisting for some time, but I figured that I provide some insight and tips for people who may be interested in commercial work. Commercial work is a huge range, basically covering everything from Portraits, fashion, food, architecture, products, corporate, advertorial, cars etc.   \n\n\n# STEP 1: FIND OUT WHAT GENRE INTEREST YOU\n\nThe best way to find out who to assist is to find out what genre you want to shoot, and what you want to get paid shooting. Is it Portraits/fashion, or is it food that interest you? what excites you when photographing? Different genres require different work.   \n\n\nDo you work better with people, or you dislike interacting with people? Maybe you enjoy working without the pressure of getting a photograph of a person in 10 minutes, so perhaps food or products are something that interest you? Are you more of an artsy person, or are you more technical, how light affects a product?   \n\n\nRemember, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to restrict yourself to one category, sometimes they crisscross, but this is a useful first step to find out what you enjoy or want.  \n\n\n# STEP 2: FIND THE PHOTOGRAPHERS YOU WANT TO WORK WITH\n\nCongrats! Now, you got to find out which photographer you want to assist. Google the category of work, and look up photographers in your area, and look through all the different photographers and their work. Compare and ask yourself what images really catches your attention. Is it the creative mind that the photographer has, or is it the way he or she can shape light on a product that draws your attention?   \n\n\nCreate a list of photographers you would like to assist, look up their social media, youtube etc. see the behind the scenes of their work, if they have one.   \n\n\n*  How many people are involved on a regular shoot? \n*  Does the photographer uses assistants or does he or she work alone? \n*  Does he or she have a photo studio, or do they work on location? \n*  Do they work with studio lights or uses natural light? \n*  Do they have a stylist team, makeup artist or other people that they hire for a shoot? \n*  What tools do they use in their work? \n* How can you help the photographer?\n\n  \nAnd then, draft out an email. Don't copy and paste, tell them honestly why you love their work, what works you particularly like, and why you want to assist them. Commercial Photographers are busy people, you won't be the only person to tell them you want to assist them, so be honest about your reasons. Most of them would appreciate a person who is serious and not just giving them a copy and pastes mail.   \n\n\nPrepare your portfolio as well. It doesn't have to be the best, but photographers need some understanding of what you can do, and if you have a theme in photos that you've taken as a hobby (say you enjoy photographing food) then it gives a better visual understanding to how you can help them. If you don't have many photos, then you should use spare time to do some photos so that they have some reference.   \n\n\n# STEP 3: WAIT\n\nDon't expect them to reply immediately, or even at all, some photographers have no need for one or maybe they just can't be bothered. It's just like job hunting, some companies write back to you saying they're not hiring, or you don't fit their criteria or simply don't email back to you. Shit happens.   \n\n\nMeanwhile, make use of the time to continue developing your skills, read or practice and get constructive critique on reddit or photography groups on social media.   \n\n\n# STEP 4: INTERVIEW\n\nIf you got a photographer expressing interest, congrats! That's the first step. Prepare yourself for some questions a photographer could ask. Show your work to him, either via a laptop, file transfer or a physical portfolio. Try not to show it on a phone, the resolution and screens are not big.   \n\n\nQuestions you may face:  \n\n\n* Why do you want to assist me? (the photographer)\n* What do you want to learn from me?\n* What do you intend to pursue?\n* What is your work/life/school schedule like? Are you able to commit to me?\n* Where do you see yourself in 'X amount of years'?\n* What about photography or assisting do you know?\n* Do you have any additional skills that could be beneficial? (Styling, you are good with making props, electrical stuff, drawing etc.)  \n\n\nThey aren't your typical corporate people, so in my experience, it's pretty laidback. Don't wear a suit and tie, that's not what you'll be working in, look for workman jeans or black trousers, covered shoes, black t-shirt.   \n\n\n# STEP 5: STARTING OUT\n\nCongrats again! Now you are an apprentice. If its an internship, great! You can add to your resume. If its a paid internship, great! Regardless, you are in the first steps to learning the ropes of commercial work.   \n\n\nOn the first day of the shoot, make sure that your photographer brief you. \n\n* What you need to wear or bring\n* What's the mood board for the shoot\n* How many other people will be on the shoot\n* What are the hours for the shoot\n* Who is the client\n* What props are involved\n* Where is the location, is it multiple locations?\n* Will there be other types of equipment involved? \n\nThings to take note for you as an assistant:  \n\n\n1. Don't be late. No excuses. (well aside from your relatives dying or if you are really sick) It goes a long way to show how passionate you are about being their assistant, and how seriously you take the role. Like any job that you want.   \n\n2. Ask questions, but ask at the right time. Before or after a shoot, What is this, how can I light the shoot? What is the purpose of this equipment? Don't ask during a shoot, they don't have time or mental space to think about technical questions if it's not related to the shoot. And your photographer's client is watching, ask too much at the wrong moment and it could be the last shoot for a long term client. Don't fuck up his or her job. \n3. Be prepared to hustle. Do whatever the photographer tells you to. Grab the wires? take it. Need produce for a food shoot? Go buy it. The photographer is hungry? Buy his or her's lunch. You're not really in the position to say no, and its not a job where you can pick and choose what you want to do. Your willingness will tell him or her if you're capable of any task, and whether they can trust you. Don't take it to your heart, do as they say.   \n\n4. Be prepared to be fucked by them. Not physically of course, but they might scream or shout at you if you screw up. Obviously, if they are seriously being an asshole at you for no reason, then leave, but if you screwed up, admit it, and learn from your mistake. It's similar to being a trainee chef in the kitchen, If you fucked up the dish, take the scolding, prepare a new one. It can feel like shit, but its only for the job. Once its over, ask your photographer what was the issue and how you can improve. \n5. Ask your photographer to teach you. They don't just want a yes man or woman, they want someone reliable they can depend on. Ask them to teach you studio lighting, styling, working with models etc. They'll be more than happy to train you, but you need to ask them. Otherwise, they won't budge. Tell them you have an idea you want to do for a shoot, and ask if they can spare time to do the shoot together. That's how you build up a good relationship with them. \n6. Don't use your phone on a shoot. It could be fucking boring, it could be long af, but don't take out your phone and browse reddit. I know because I'm addicted to my phone. Your client is going to see you doing it, and they will ask your photographer why are you here. I know it sucks, but its a job, you're there for your job so do whatever it takes to not fuck it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TIPS\n\nThese are sort of general, so it's may not be usable to every photographer, but it can be handy for you. \n\n* Always have gaffer tape with you close by, more often than not, this tape is super useful for all sorts of situations photography related.\n* Always have a pen and notebook on you, write shit down.\n* Have an inventory checklist before a shoot and after. This way, things don't go missing when your photographer shoots on location\n* Learn photography/assistant lingo. What's an applebox? What's a C-stand? These are terms that get thrown around, so you should be sure what it means when the photographer asks you for an item. \n* Test the light setup before your shoot, it saves time so you don't have to struggle on set.\n* Do location scouting prior to that, find out where you can go and cannot go on a location, what composition work, take photos and send to your photographer's whatsapp\n* Keep things need and tidy, don't let wires run everywhere on set, people could trip, and you don't want their clients hurting or falling on the job. \n* Have the appropriate tools for the shoot, check with your photographer if certain items are necessary or could help with a shoot. \n\n# RESOURCES:\n\nHere are some resources I personally found to be handy in my role as an assistant. Its similar to what a grip on the film set does, but also including the lighting as you could be dealing with strobes and adjusting it for the photographer.   \n\n\nGRIP TIPS  \n [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6xliqRXcbqk6vU\\_GxaITQQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6xliqRXcbqk6vU_GxaITQQ)   \n\n\nTHE SLANTED LENS\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSlantedLens](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSlantedLens) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWE EAT TOGETHER (FOOD PHOTOGRAPHY)  \n [https://www.youtube.com/user/YellowStreetPhotos](https://www.youtube.com/user/YellowStreetPhotos) \n\n  \n ROCKET JUMP FILM SCHOOL\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/user/RJFilmSchool](https://www.youtube.com/user/RJFilmSchool) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nROBERT HALL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallPD](https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallPD) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPRO EDU (INCLUDES SOME FREE TUTORIALS)\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/user/rggedu](https://www.youtube.com/user/rggedu) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it for now, anything that I missed out or forgotten, I'll add to the OP later on.

(styling, you are good with making props, electrical stuff, drawing etc.)  \n\n\nthey aren't your typical corporate people, so in my experience, it's pretty laidback. don't wear a suit and tie, that's not what you'll be working in, look for workman jeans or black trousers, covered shoes, black t-shirt.   \n\n\n# step 5: starting out\n\ncongrats again! now you are an apprentice. if its an internship, great! you can add to your resume. if its a paid internship, great! regardless, you are in the first steps to learning the ropes of commercial work.   \n\n\non the first day of the shoot, make sure that your photographer brief you. \n\n* what you need to wear or bring\n* what's the mood board for the shoot\n* how many other people will be on the shoot\n* what are the hours for the shoot\n* who is the client\n* what props are involved\n* where is the location, is it multiple locations?\n* will there be other types of equipment involved? \n\nthings to take note for you as an assistant:  \n\n\n1. don't be late. no excuses. (well aside from your relatives dying or if you are really sick) it goes a long way to show how passionate you are about being their assistant, and how seriously you take the role. like any job that you want.   \n\n2. ask questions, but ask at the right time. before or after a shoot, what is this, how can i light the shoot? what is the purpose of this equipment? don't ask during a shoot, they don't have time or mental space to think about technical questions if it's not related to the shoot. and your photographer's client is watching, ask too much at the wrong moment and it could be the last shoot for a long term client. don't fuck up his or her job. \n3. be prepared to hustle. do whatever the photographer tells you to. grab the wires? take it. need produce for a food shoot? go buy it. the photographer is hungry? buy his or her's lunch. you're not really in the position to say no, and its not a job where you can pick and choose what you want to do. your willingness will tell him or her if you're capable of any task, and whether they can trust you. don't take it to your heart, do as they say.   \n\n4. be prepared to be fucked by them. not physically of course, but they might scream or shout at you if you screw up. obviously, if they are seriously being an asshole at you for no reason, then leave, but if you screwed up, admit it, and learn from your mistake. it's similar to being a trainee chef in the kitchen, if you fucked up the dish, take the scolding, prepare a new one. it can feel like shit, but its only for the job. once its over, ask your photographer what was the issue and how you can improve. \n5. ask your photographer to teach you. they don't just want a yes man or woman, they want someone reliable they can depend on. ask them to teach you studio lighting, styling, working with models etc. they'll be more than happy to train you, but you need to ask them. otherwise, they won't budge. tell them you have an idea you want to do for a shoot, and ask if they can spare time to do the shoot together. that's how you build up a good relationship with them. \n6. don't use your phone on a shoot. it could be fucking boring, it could be long af, but don't take out your phone and browse reddit. i know because i'm addicted to my phone. your client is going to see you doing it, and they will ask your photographer why are you here. i know it sucks, but its a job, you're there for your job so do whatever it takes to not fuck it up. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n# tips\n\nthese are sort of general, so it's may not be usable to every photographer, but it can be handy for you. \n\n* always have gaffer tape with you close by, more often than not, this tape is super useful for all sorts of situations photography related.\n* always have a pen and notebook on you, write shit down.\n* have an inventory checklist before a shoot and after. this way, things don't go missing when your photographer shoots on location\n* learn photography/assistant lingo. what's an applebox? what's a c-stand? these are terms that get thrown around, so you should be sure what it means when the photographer asks you for an item. \n* test the light setup before your shoot, it saves time so you don't have to struggle on set.\n* do location scouting prior to that, find out where you can go and cannot go on a location, what composition work, take photos and send to your photographer's whatsapp\n* keep things need and tidy, don't let wires run everywhere on set, people could trip, and you don't want their clients hurting or falling on the job. \n* have the appropriate tools for the shoot, check with your photographer if certain items are necessary or could help with a shoot. \n\n# resources:\n\nhere are some resources i personally found to be handy in my role as an assistant. its similar to what a grip on the film set does, but also including the lighting as you could be dealing with strobes and adjusting it for the photographer.   \n\n\ngrip tips  \n [https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc6xliqrxcbqk6vu\\_gxaitqq](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc6xliqrxcbqk6vu_gxaitqq)   \n\n\nthe slanted lens\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/user/theslantedlens](https://www.youtube.com/user/theslantedlens) \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nwe eat together (food photography)  \n [https://www.youtube.com/user/yellowstreetphotos](https://www.youtube.com/user/yellowstreetphotos) \n\n  \n rocket jump film school\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/user/rjfilmschool](https://www.youtube.com/user/rjfilmschool) \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nrobert hall photography\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallpd](https://www.youtube.com/user/rrhallpd) \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\npro edu (includes some free tutorials)\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/user/rggedu](https://www.youtube.com/user/rggedu) \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthat's it for now, anything that i missed out or forgotten, i'll add to the op later on. hope this helps!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 77476, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 75616, "autor": "SAMxLEGN", "date": 1578954246000, "content": "Shot by Samsung S9+ | Edited by Adobe Lightroom | Location Libya,Tripoli", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/eobi3v/shot_by_samsung_s9_edited_by_adobe_lightroom/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "photography", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "shot by samsung s9+ | edited by adobe lightroom | -----> location !!!  libya,tripoli", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 77566, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 75826, "autor": "marko45142", "date": 1580178677000, "content": "Setting up a shot by searching certain lunar conditions at a particular location?

It's been fun, 99% of the photos I take myself and edit myself. On occasion I collaborate with someone like a boyfriend, friend, or photographer on something. \n\nLast year, I designed and hand-made a dress to be nearly identical to one that Audrey Hepburn wore in an early photo in Kew Gardens. I put together the whole outfit, and when I went to London, my plan was to go there either with a tripod or a friend and make my recreations. A newer friend of mine (we met because of a mutual ex-boyfriend) volunteered her teenage son to help take the photo, since he likes photography. \n\nWe met at the park, and we started looking for the locations where the photos in Audrey's photo session were taken. I handed him my camera, and I and his mom would check the pictures on my phone to double check the angles and the poses. I ended up with three photos on my 'to do' list, which I then took home and edited, and shared on Instagram, of course thanking them for their help.\n\nCut to this year, another friend was working with a publisher on a book on Audrey Hepburn and really wanted to include some photos of me in the introduction. I sent over 9 of my favourites, including one from Kew. He decided on two that I had edited myself into, which were taken in the 1950's and 1960's. I assume he did whatever needed done to clear those. And the third was one from Kew. \n\nNow, the whole time before this, I've been very good at giving photographers credit, but for some reason it just never crossed my mind, this whole time. It's been a stressful year - I moved from California to France, and then went on a 3 month road trip (with my cat) between five countries. Then I spent a month apartment-hunting, and then trying to furnish the place. I've been extremely forgetful. I'll find emails I failed to reply to from 3 months ago. Anyway when I posted a photo of the page in the book, it was *then* that it was brought to my attention. I freaked the hell out and had a panic attack. I didn't mean to do that to my friends who had helped me create this picture I love. I was a wreck. I wrote her an apology message (which she still hasn't replied to, 5 days later) and then basically posted on IG that I had to take a mental health break for a while. I couldn't deal. For 3 days. Just couldn't eat, couldn't do much of anything, but I decided to limit my social media, and anything unnecessary, start looking for a therapist, do *anything* I could do for myself because I don't even feel in control of my own brain at this point. Anyway I got it together and wrote her son a long apology on Friday, and told him what I would try to do to fix it, and to make it up to him. Still no response. But now my friend who used the photo for the book (who hadn't seemed concerned up until this point, calling it an 'assisted self-portrait', and I don't know, he's dealt with photos for decades, he's a collector and author and worked at the National Portrait Gallery) said that the kid has sent an angry email to his publisher, which wasn't very cool.\n\nSide note. My own personal issue here is WTF would they not even talk to me privately but rather make public posts, share it with their friends who call me horrible names, and then email the publisher but never even try to clear it up with me first. \n\nBut my legal question (and sorry it took me this long to write this, but UGGGGG) is who owns this photo? I mean I was thinking about it today and honestly, I would be kind of pissed if HE used it without telling me, or asking me. Because it's my project, my series, I put way more effort into creating the photo than he did (I spent DAYS making the dress), he has no use for it, and I basically just handed him my camera. If you handed a friend your camera and directed them on how to take the picture, how can they possibly claim that it's 'theirs'? Personally, yes, I would appreciate a credit if someone used the photo I took of them, but I certainly wouldn't stop them from using it if they were the ones to conceive it and do all the work to create it. This is MY photo. Now he's trying to limit what I can do with it, just because he stood there and pushed the button. I have another friend who told me to do whatever I wanted with the photos she took of me. We're friends and it's for fun. Now of course when I work with a photographer and sign a release, I get that I have to ask them first. But I'm 99% sure we did not sign a release (I'll leave 1% of doubt because I'm forgetful and haven't dug through my papers. But in my moving process I don't recall coming across one for that day). If he's going to start a fight over who can use MY photo, oh yeah I'm going to fight him. But hell, if he's going to be such an asshole about it, I'll just go back and take new photos there next time I'm in London. \n\nI'm definitely feeling bad about not acknowledging him, but I'm also getting pretty annoyed right now at the way they're dealing with this.

I'm not concerned about the weight, but do want something durable and will last me a long time and can ideally handle travel/drops/accidents and is repairable.\n\nI have a dell xps 15 2017 16 GB 9560 which I loved at first, but over time the laptop really slowed down and the screen was sub par for the color accuracy I needed and brightness nits for working in less than ideal locations. On top of that, the laptop completely took a shit with battery issues and apparently needs a motherboard replacement with a 700$ price tag. This is unacceptable and I need something that A. has an amazing screen B. won't slow down, C. have any hardware issues two to three years later- and D. actually has a good warranty that a company will honor.\n\nSo to completely spell out what I'm looking for- I need a laptop with the BEST screen and color accuracy (nothing smaller than 15 inches and 4k of course), the quickest processing speeds so I can stay inspired and present instead of frustrated at how slowly lightroom is responding, something that can hold a charge for at least a couple hours at full brightness, a company that is reputable and reliable with a solid warranty and good quality (not very pleased with DELL currently). And a laptop that will last a while (at least three to five years) without slowdowns or bugs. I'm open to any brand/model- the only reason I haven't jumped on buying a mac is because of the doubts on having the best screens/value. Oh, and hopefully between 1500-3500.\n\nIf you have the magic answer please do tell! I'm open to all advice.

In particular, the use of metadata in your photos can be leveraged. The IPTC site [https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/quick-guide-to-iptc-photo-metadata-and-google-images/](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/quick-guide-to-iptc-photo-metadata-and-google-images/) provides the latest information on what metadata Google Search uses; the \u201cWeb Statement of Rights\u201d and \u201cLicensor URL\u201d being the the most recent additions.\n\nI use Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Lightroom Classic (LrC) on Windows 10 for my photographic workflow, and I\u2019ve set up LrC metadata presets so all the essential details are there in my photos, and I use LrC export to create my images for sharing. However, there is a lot of other metadata in those LrC exported files that you probably don\u2019t want to share, and there is a way to selectively strip those out. I got the idea from [https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data](https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data) but their method nukes most of the metadata which you don\u2019t really want to do. As per that article, I used [Phil Harvey\u2019s Windows executable ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) version 15205 as part of the LrC export function, but I\u2019ve gone for a more surgical removal of the data. This is the Windows Command Prompt batch file:\n\n    c:\\utils\\exiftool.exe -overwrite_original -a ^\n    -XMP-photoshop:All= ^\n    -XMP-photoshop:Credit=\"Kulvinder Singh Matharu\" ^\n    -XMP-dc:Format= ^\n    -XMP-xmpMM:All= ^\n    -XMP-crs:All= ^\n    -XMP-xmp:All= ^\n    -IFD0:Software= ^\n    -GPS:All= ^\n    %*\n\nPlease update to suite your environment (where you installed ExifTool for example). Note that I renamed \u201cexiftool(-k).exe\u201d to \u201cexiftool.exe\u201d to enable command-line use. The GPS line in the ExifTool command is just a safety precaution of mine and is not essential as LrC export can be configured to remove location data.\n\nI also used ExifToolGUI as my GUI for ExitTools to inspect my files. ExifToolGUI hasn\u2019t been updated in many years, and it takes a bit of wrangling to get it to work in modern Windows; I\u2019ve managed to get it to work in Windows 10 Pro (2004) 64-bit through some trial and error!\n\nThe macOS process for LrC export should be pretty similar; just use the [Photography Life article](https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data) as a guide; I don\u2019t use macOS so I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable listing the code here.\n\nYou can also create a batch script that can be run from Command Prompt to change the metadata for files that are already exported, and where you don\u2019t want to run the LrC export function all over again.

 data.\n\ni also used exiftoolgui as my gui for exittools to inspect my files. exiftoolgui hasn\u2019t been updated in many years, and it takes a bit of wrangling to get it to work in modern windows; i\u2019ve managed to get it to work in windows 10 pro (2004) 64-bit through some trial and error!\n\nthe macos process for lrc export should be pretty similar; just use the [photography life article](https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data) as a guide; i don\u2019t use macos so i wouldn\u2019t be comfortable listing the code here.\n\nyou can also create a batch script that can be run from command prompt to change the metadata for files that are already exported, and where you don\u2019t want to run the lrc export function all over again. so, for jpeg files the batch command would be:\n\n    c:\\utils\\exiftool.exe -overwrite_original -r. -a ^\n    -xmp-photoshop:all= ^\n    -xmp-photoshop:credit=\"kulvinder singh matharu\" ^\n    -xmp-dc:format= ^\n    -xmp-xmpmm:all= ^\n    -xmp-crs:all= ^\n    -xmp-xmp:all= ^\n    -ifd0:software= ^\n    -gps:all= ^\n    -ext jpg .\n\nthis will recursively change the metadata in all jpegs in the current folder and in all sub-folders. what i\u2019ve found, to my surprise, is that if i just paste the above straight into command prompt it will work!

I intended to keep it short, but as I did more and more digging, I came across more and more hobbyists like myself falling for these, so I wanted to be as detailed as possible, to help others avoid the same mistakes.\n\nI think most of us can agree that one of the biggest honours we can receive is to have our work displayed for paying art lovers to see, and possibly purchase. However, as an amateur/hobbyist photography, we can fall into the trap of falling for either scams or bad deals.\n\nHaving a website is a great way to exhibit your work in a way you want to, but in my experience, it also increases in number of people who contact you for various reasons. Over the last year or so, I've been contacted by several people, sometimes claiming to work for companies that want to exhibit my work in countries I've never been to, other times offering other 'opportunities'. I'm a naturally pessimistic person with pretty low levels of self confidence related success, which leaves me skeptical to any form of unsolicited \"good\" or \"exciting\" news  (And for those of you wondering:  no, I'm not fun at parties). However, the benefit of being such a dower all the time is that I'm always skeptical when someone reaches out to me regarding my photography, which means I always do research into who/what the person or company is, especially when the email seems to be cookie-cutter.\n\nA little while back, I was contacted by a company I'd never heard of offering to exhibit my work in Europe in a number of \"prestigious venues\", two of which it named. I Googled the company, and it seems legit enough, then I Googled the locations and whoa, these look nice... almost too nice for a show full of amateurs, but whatever, I'm not going to complain. They even linked to two of my pictures in my portfolio, to which they had taken a liking. Everything was looking pretty decent so far, and I'm a little embarrassed to say I was even starting to feel hopeful. So I continued reading to email \"the application proposal is free\"... wut? You reached out to me to display my work, why would the application process not be free? Whatever, I'm still kind of new to this, so maybe you usually have to pay.\n\nSo I continued reading. \"If selected there is a participation fee related to...\" Hold up. Now I have to pay because you want to exhibit my work that you reached out to me about? That seems like a bit of a red flag, but I could be wrong. They didn't clarify anywhere what the range of fees could be but, OK, it's one exhibition Micheal, what could it cost $10? - so I looked into it, and apparently people had been charged upwards of 200-300 Euros per piece (prices seemed to depend on the venue). I understand that business is business, but that seems a little steep considering that doesn't include the fees for printing, framing, and shipping. Here in Tokyo, while I've payed to enter competitions, the winners exhibition was always free, all I had to do was send a high resolution image (they covered printing and exhibition fees).  But whatever, this is a different situation, they want to make sure the art print is on the paper of my choice with my preferred dimensions, so maybe it's normal.\n\nI'll spare you the details, but the rest of the email went on to explain that I had to mail them my framed picture (of course I'd have to pay), and if no one purchased it, I'd have to pay to have it sent back. Upon reading the experiences of other artists, some claimed they never got their work back, including original paintings. At this point, I'd decided that I wasn't even going to entertain the idea of applying, but the curious side of me wanted to keep looking into it.\n\nSo I did some digging into the company and found that, over the years they've contacted countless  artists and some of the \"prestigious\" venues they held their exhibitions in ended up being 2 star hostels. Upon re-reading the exhibition dates, I noticed that they claimed all of the events would be held within the same time frame, meaning there was certainty that my work would end up in one of the nice looking galleries rather than one of the unnamed locations.\n\nNow, all of this isn't to say that this was a \"scam\", they may very well be a legitimate company with good intentions, but had I been less skeptical, I may have been convinced into paying hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to have my work exhibited, potentially, in a 2 star hostel under the guise of a \"prestigious\" venue. I'm also not saying that I think my work is so great that it should be exhibited for free, had they offered to handle the framing and the fees were more reasonable, I would have considered it, but I know what having my work exhibited is worth, having a $70 picture exhibited at a cost of hundreds of dollars just didn't seem like it was worth the effort. I'd rather exhibit my work locally, so I could actually visit the exhibition and mingle with people.\n\nSo, for any hobbyists or amateurs out there who get contacted for services, jobs, exhibitions, or even awards, do your due diligence before accepting anything. I've found in the past that Googling \" \\*company name\\* legit\" usually proves useful. I've fallen into the trap of submitting to awards that seem less than legit upon reflection (It seems everyone who entered got an honourable mention, so you know... not so honourable)\n\nI've chosen not to name the company or individual who reached out to me, as I'm not entirely sure they did so with malicious intent or anything, but I just thought it was worth reminding my fellow hobbyists that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I hesitate to call this a \"scam\" because they seem to follow through with the shows, but I do consider it to be a little misleading, and a bad value, on the face of it. I decided to write this because I saw some really upset artists claiming they thought it was worth it because they were \"investing in themselves\" and \"getting their work out there\", but all it did was burn a hole in their pockets. If you really want to know the name of the company to avoid wasting as much time as I did, send me a DM, and I'll get back to you when I can.\n\nSome precautions I take when I'm contacted:\n\n1. Google as much of the information as possible (often adding \"legit\" or \"scam\" to find immediate results). Of course, you should take some of the results with a grain of salt, I often see people using the word \"scam\" as a synonym for \"not worth it\".\n2. Consider the formatting of the email. Does it seem cookie-cutter? Then it's probably been sent out to hundreds of others, showing they're not interested in me in particular.\n3. Don't click on any links until you verify the person/company is legit.\n4. If the person uses my contact page, I respond. If they don't reply, it's likely dubious.\n5. If they have an address available, go ahead and Google it, see if things match up.\n\nThere are always people out there trying to take advantage of small artists so feel free to share any of your experiences or extend any warnings below. Also, if you have any personal steps you take to avoid these kinds of things, feel free to share.\n\n\\*note: I initially write this back in October but decided to hold off to see if these kinds of emails continued... and boy did they ever. Since the writing of this have continued to receive emails offering me things like brand ambassador opportunities, which I quickly found to be scams or at least sketchy through my usual methods.

So I thought I'd share my process, for whom it may interest :-D\n\nI was considering so many options: Sony A7c, Panasonic GH5, Canon R6, Olympus EM1 III and more... \n\nMy background: I'm a hybrid photo and video shooter. I do vlogs and some pro video work, landscape, portraits and travel photography. I can only carry a limited weight on me, for traveling and because of some light back problems I have. \n\nI wanted a camera that can produce high quality photos and videos, be travel friendly and lightweight, and the S5 ticks (almost) all the boxes with a few bonuses. \n\nI like that Panasonic are somewhat of an underdog in the industry today, so they pack their cameras with useful features and not hold back at all! Other cameras in the same price range (and even above) have all sorts of limitations, as with Sony, Nikon and Canon. It just seems like Panasonic throws everything in as they really respect their photographers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the pro of the S5 for me:\n\n\\- High-rez mode great for landscape photography \n\n\\- Lots of customizable buttons and menu options, great for hybrid shooting! \n\n\\- Not as expensive as the competition \n\n\\- Smaller than most similar cameras! That's a great advantage \n\n\\- The lens looks amazing quality, 20-60 is a \n\n\\- Very good dynamic range and image quality all around\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only cons I found are: \n\n\\- Crop factor for higher resolution videos, a limit that needs to be taken into account when planning a shoot. \n\n\\- Continuous autofocus of course! It's just unreliable. For photography I plan to use mostly single AF, and for video... probably manual unfortunately!\n\n\\- lenses for the L mount are so expensive! That's why I got to use a Leica M mount adapter, and plan to try on some vintage lenses with it.
