In the coming months these scanners will be operational at 145 airports in the US. CT scanning technology has been used for checked luggage for many years, and Kodak Alaris and Eastman Kodak have warned photographers not to check their film, but rather to carry it on and request it be hand-checked by TSA agents at Security.\n\nTo better assess the risk to film from the new carry on scanners we brought a small quantity of Portra 400/135 to John F Kennedy Airport in NYC. With the help of TSA representatives the film was put through the new carry on CT scanners from 1-10 times. The film was then evaluated at Eastman Kodak Research facilities. The initial results are not good. Just 1 scan shows significant film fogging, leading to smoky blacks and loss of shadow detail. This will be more significant for higher speed films. Although it\u2019s possible that a roll of 100 speed film would show less degradation, we strongly recommend against putting any unexposed or exposed but unprocessed film through a CT Scanner.\n\nWe reached out to the TSA to ask what options there might be to warn passengers. We originally asked if it would be possible to add signage at airports that utilize CT scanning technology. We are developing warning stickers that can be placed on your film. These will be available in a label format so they can be printed on your in-home or in-office printer. Just attach the label to the plastic bag as described in the TSA description below.\n\nThe TSA did tell us that all TSA screeners are trained to hand check roll and movie film as well as single-use cameras. Sheet film in boxes may require more diligence on the part of the photographer.\n\n**From the TSA:**\n\nMost x-ray machines used to screen carry-on bags should not damage undeveloped film under ASA\\ISO 800. There are a limited number of screening checkpoints that use x-ray equipment that may damage undeveloped film. These airports will have signage in front of the x-ray stating that the x-ray may damage undeveloped film.\n\nIf you are traveling with the following types of film, please pack it in a clear plastic bag, remove it from your carry-on bag at the checkpoint, and ask for a hand inspection:\n\n\u2022 Film with an ASA\\ISO 800 or higher\n\n\n\u2022 Highly sensitive x-ray or scientific films\n\n\u2022 Film that is or will be underexposed\n\n\u2022 Film that you intend to \u201cpush process\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sheet film\n\n\u2022 Large format film\n\n\u2022 Medical film\n\n\u2022 Scientific film\n\n\u2022 Motion picture film\n\n\u2022 Professional grade film\n\n\u2022 Film of any speed that is subjected to x-ray screening more than five times\n\nIn most cases, the x-ray equipment used for screening checked baggage will damage undeveloped film; therefore, please place undeveloped film in carry-on bags.\n\nFor more information please download the film Storage and Care Information sheet from our website: https://imaging.kodakalaris.com/sites/uat/files/wysiwyg/pro/CIS_E30.pdf\n\nFor more information on TSA use of CT technology, please:\nhttps://www.tsa.gov/computed-tomography\n\nFor more information on TSA screening procedures, please visit https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.tsa.gov__;!!NtZYYMejrjoc!zT1yWuBDz_WVf9AKKbVY49YPyeiJjKj7J1eN1H_VrLccohflzcJrblf4LaGd9CmUX8FGDRU2$ .\n\n**These US airports currently use CT scanning technology:**\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)\n\nBaltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI)\n\nChicago O\u2019Hare International Airport (ORD)\n\nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG)\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW)\n\nHouston Hobby Airport (HOU)\n\nIndianapolis International Airport (IND)\n\nJohn F.

Im not asking how to sue anyone myself, only to be protected from this particular situation.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and hope it made sense.

I ended up with three photos on my 'to do' list, which I then took home and edited, and shared on Instagram, of course thanking them for their help.\n\nCut to this year, another friend was working with a publisher on a book on Audrey Hepburn and really wanted to include some photos of me in the introduction.

Little bit excited right now.) \n\nI know y'all don't know me very well, but I'm a daytime shooter. I've shot thousands of bird images, some of which I am incredibly proud of along with a few touristy type shots. Thanks to the efforts of a member of this SR ( u/junon ) I figured I ought to just find out if my kit could maybe do something outside the bland. Sad to admit, but most nature photography, birds and wildlife, you've got three basic setups; bright sunny, overcast, and dusk. Once you learn those parameters, not a lot of moving around in the sets; you can take 500 images without touching the setup. \n\nI can say that in 10 years of active photography, I've never felt more \"outside the comfort zone\" and \"at the learning tree\" than I was from 1:00AM to 1:30AM, 5/31/20, a couple hours ago. Wow. Whole new game, nothing I'm accustomed to, nothing I'm used to. Felt zero comfort. Oh, and I need to file a police report; one of the bugs I encountered while out, I think he was carrying a switchblade or a silent power drill. Yipes.  \n\nBefore I drop the links to the only \"salvageable\" shots of the endeavor, gotta warn you; I did not drive a thousand miles to big sky country for a test run. I went to a spot in my yard with a window of sky among all my trees. I live in an incredibly rural area and on satellite photos, you gotta zoom way in to see there's even a structure here; we got trees galore. So, I knew going in that I wasn't going to be getting an enormous FOV horizon to horizon. This aint Montana, and tonight was merely a test-run. A \"Is this even slightly possible, and if so, is it doable enough to go somewhere with a bigger window of open sky?\" test. \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM](https://imgur.com/a/7A5d4NM) \n\nWow. That's the freakin' Milky Way...well, the edge of it anyways. Having DL'ed Stellarium and also made use of the web version, I'm a bit smarter about it all, and I can confirm those smokey red tingers are not from the local stoners; that's the haze of the Milky Way with guest appearances by Kaus Australis and other cast members of the [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)) constellation. \n\nSo, what did I learn? \n\nFirst...it's super not useful to try to use the viewfinder. I'm a traditional \"hold it up to your face like a noob\" shooter. It's the method I've used for all prior photography efforts and thousands of bird pictures. So, to be robbed of that tool is frustrating to a high degree. You're essentially working blind. I found a semi-workable method. Pull focus on a bright star through the view if you can (made difficult by the screen being right below your eye glaring for you), then go on the screen and just be careful not to touch the zoom or focus ring. AF was 100% unsupportive of my efforts, so I used manual. With so little light, the camera was basically warning me \"Hey, stupid head, I'm not going to take an image of the inside of the lens cap. You'll not make me look bad at what I do best. No thank you. Add light or I won't participate.\"\n\nSecond, there are few feelings as helpless as waiting on a 30 second exposure when you don't even know what the framing is like. It's legitimately like being ten feet underground on the screen because you're working blind. First couple shots, if I'd gotten an image of a Jackson Pollock painting I wouldn't have been surprised. You're working blind and that makes a 30 second exposure seem like a weekend waiting to see what each shot is going to turn out like. \"Did I bump the tripod and accidentally point it right at this towering oak tree? Am I framed? Did I bork a setting? All good? Hello? Anybody in there???\"   \n\nThird, I need better glass...probably a better camera to put behind it too. At ISO3200 I was getting pretty substantial noise, but it's a start. This is a (sh\\*\\*ty) kit lens, and for about 99% of what the average person (and myself) would do with this camera, it's sufficient. For Astro...I admit I'm trying to punch well above my weight class. It's a small sensor behind a cheapo lens. It has limits, obviously. I'm fairly sure there are cell phone cameras that could output higher quality than the two \"best\" from my outing. So be it; this is the gear I have. I'm scrimping for a nifty fifty but even it will be scraping the bottom of the barrel because I don't have the cash to drop on a $5,000 camera or a $200 piece of glass. End of Day, ISO3200 is going to be noisy on this camera, but it's what I've got to work with.  My SL1 is not a state of the art rig anymore and I know it. In this, I recognize that my gear is handcuffing me. Have to think the folks who came up with the EOS100 never figured some flatbilly from Tennessee would be trying to take a picture of something 150 Light-Years away from the sensor. So...kinda have to live with the fact that my gear isn't set up for this, and the budget isn't going to be capable of fixing that. This aint the rig for a pixel-peeper, not by a long shot. \n\nFourth, it's fun. More than I expected. It's much like fishing and I love fishing; when I push down the button and wait for the two-second delay (I used 2S to minimize shake) I'm casting the lure and asking a question; do I get something good, or nothing? Is there something here for me on this cast? Each press of the shutter is me asking a question and I'll admit it's a thrill to get an answer that, on the screen, is sort of what I expected. Very gratifying to get it on the desktop monitor in fully noisy-garbled glory. \n\nFifth, I've been doing myself a disservice not shooting raw. I've been toying with the idea of shooting raw for a while and I should have been doing it since day one, minute one. So much more power and control. My best bird to date would look soooo much better if I'd shot it raw and had the control over it. It's a hassle and my dino-saur junky computer struggles through the process, but man, so much control. To those who think \"Well, it doesn't matter, I'm just going to output as a JPG with an 800x600 size anyways, why go to the trouble?\" you're wrong. So much control over so many aspects. Tons of control, tons of options. While raw control matters more in images like the Astro ones, I can now see that it is a powerful tool I shouldn't have waited this long to learn and use. \n\nSixth, I'm gonna get some bug spray. The big jug. Like I said, I think one pulled a knife on me, or was drilling for blood from a deeper source. \n\nSeventh, a few basic parameters helps; Learning from u/junon that I'm just going to have to crank the ISO and live with the noise, it's helpful. To know that it's a long exposure at high ISO, shooting wide open, it's good to have a basic starting point. I did start playing with the settings a bit, but it's always nice to have a starting point of reference to go off of. Some have this instinctively, and for daylight images I do, but for this kind of shooting I was in the weeds and out of my element. I've done a very small amount of shooting where I'm dialing in a \"kill me with noise, daddy\" ISO and running with it. \n\nEighth and finally, I can improve. Not only am I relearning the basics in terms of how to photograph a unique subject, I'm also learning the basics of how to edit raw, how to clean massive noise, how to work with raw images. RawTherapee is a powerful tool and it's on me learn how to make it work for me to the max. Astrophotography is new for me, and it's on me to learn how to do it well within my constraints. \n\nBut it is doable. It is possible. I'd just about bet most everyone reading this might have a camera that could give it a stab. It's not a \"Oh, I must have a 1DX or better, gotta have at least a Hasselblad X1D II to have any success. All beneath that is futile.\" Nah. SL1 Reb with the lousiest kit lens that I refer to lovingly as my \"sh\\*\\*ty kitty\" lens, and go do it. \n\nThe future holds many things of great depth, and I'm lucky to have started with such lousy results; I can only improve!", "title": "My first stab at Astro.", "num-comments": 13, "score": 1, "date": "2020-05-31 09:46:53", "content": "My first stab at Astro. /!/ (I apologize in advance for the length.

But I am very much at odds with the current concept and development in photography. But first I will tell you something about my background.\n\nI got my first digital camera in 2004 when I was 10 years old. A HP with 4 Megapixels and a 16 Megabyte memory card. I walked everywhere with this camera and was super proud to photograph the world from my point of view. It was very exciting and of course everything was very new. In 2008 I bought a Samsung NV24HD with my own money, which was very innovative and high quality for a small compact camera at that time. The handling, the image quality and the design made me melt at that time, I kept this camera like my own baby. From that time on I started to take pictures in a more \"professional\" way, that means I really started to think about how a camera works and how my pictures could be better. I soon realized that I needed something better and bigger.   \n \n\nAfter a long research I decided to use the Canon EOS 600D with a kit lens. And once again I was as excited as never before, finally I was able to photograph the stars, edit pictures afterwards on the computer with RAW and even explored the landscapes in light rain. I bought it in 2011 and sold it (fast forward) 2020. \n\nI uploaded my pictures to 500px, to Instagram and to other platforms and got an incredible response, within a short time I had thousands of likes. I felt super comfortable and thanks to the comments below the pictures I could improve at the same time. I travelled with this camera to Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, the USA and many other countries. It has served me very faithfully. Later on I bought some expensive and good lenses, a very good and stable tripod and various other accessories, such as a grayscale filter. The problem was that the bag got heavier and heavier and changing the lenses became more and more complicated. On later trips I took the camera with me everywhere, but I used it less and less. I wanted to enjoy the moment more instead of wasting 5 minutes of my precious vacation time to set up my camera. You notice that I could not enjoy taking pictures any more. So of course I took less pictures altogether and published less pictures. After careful consideration I got myself a Canon Powershot G5X, because it was the (seemingly) perfect companion for my holiday purposes. The excitement about this camera was not so great anymore, but I had the hope that I would rediscover photography for myself. Since then the EOS 600D just lay in the cupboard and waited for its next use.

But unfortunately there were some failures which disturbed me so much that after a while I didn't feel like using the camera for taking pictures anymore. In automatic mode no RAW shots could be taken, there was no reasonable protection for the aperture cover etc. pp. After 3 years and less than 1000 photos taken with this camera I decided to try my luck again.

I had my sights set on the Fuji X-T2 for a long time and just knew that this would be my new camera! \n\nWhen I bought it second hand, I even saved a lot of money, but what can I say? Apparently I was again unlucky. The autofocus doesn't sit properly despite some updates and the smartphone app doesn't transfer RAW images. Since I usually only take my iPad with me when I'm on the road and edit pictures on it, I couldn't work properly here either. It bothers me so much that I really don't want to use it anymore.\n\nNow, after a long introduction, I come to the point. I am fed up with it! I am tired of the fact that many things no longer work properly. The innovation in cameras seems to have stopped 10 years ago. If you compare the development steps of system cameras/DSRL cameras with smartphone cameras, I have to say that a lot of things are going wrong with Canon, Nikon, etc.!\n\nOf course, a lot has changed for me personally during this time. I'm more minimalistic than before and now hate every ballast I have to carry around with me. A system camera could have fit if the smartphone app had been programmed properly and the lens had worked. Putting a lot of money into repairs again? No, thanks, I'm sick of it!   \n \n\nAfter some more very long thinking, I have now decided to give up photography as I have come to love it. Instead of a real camera I will now switch to smartphone photography. Whether this is the right step, I do not know yet. But at the moment it offers me what the camera manufacturers cannot offer me! Reasonable software, constant improvements by updates, portability and flexibility, fast and easy transfer of the pictures to other devices (e.g. my iPad) and many other things the big camera manufacturers seem to have never heard of. Why don't Canon and Sony dare to go a completely different way? And not via hardware, but via software. Best of all, of course, in combination! What is possible today with algorithms, nobody would have dared to claim 10 years ago. Astrophotography with a smartphone? Formerly unthinkable, today in parts very well possible. Depth of field?

When I pay 1000\u20ac for a camera, I expect the whole package to be right. That the lens does not focus properly, that can happen.

But I am very much at odds with the current concept and development in photography. But first I will tell you something about my background.\n\nI got my first digital camera in 2004 when I was 10 years old. A HP with 4 Megapixels and a 16 Megabyte memory card. I walked everywhere with this camera and was super proud to photograph the world from my point of view. It was very exciting and of course everything was very new. In 2008 I bought a Samsung NV24HD with my own money, which was very innovative and high quality for a small compact camera at that time. The handling, the image quality and the design made me melt at that time, I kept this camera like my own baby. From that time on I started to take pictures in a more \"professional\" way, that means I really started to think about how a camera works and how my pictures could be better. I soon realized that I needed something better and bigger.   \n \n\nAfter a long research I decided to use the Canon EOS 600D with a kit lens. And once again I was as excited as never before, finally I was able to photograph the stars, edit pictures afterwards on the computer with RAW and even explored the landscapes in light rain. I bought it in 2011 and sold it (fast forward) 2020. \n\nI uploaded my pictures to 500px, to Instagram and to other platforms and got an incredible response, within a short time I had thousands of likes. -----> I !!!  felt super comfortable and thanks to the comments below the pictures -----> -----> I !!!  could improve !!!  at the same time. I travelled with this camera to Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, the USA and many other countries. It has served me very faithfully. Later on I bought some expensive and good lenses, a very good and stable tripod and various other accessories, such as a grayscale filter. The problem was that the bag got heavier and heavier and changing the lenses became more and more complicated. On later trips I took the camera with me everywhere, but I used it less and less. I wanted to enjoy the moment more instead of wasting 5 minutes of my precious vacation time to set up my camera. You notice that I could not enjoy taking pictures any more. So of course I took less pictures altogether and published less pictures. After careful consideration I got myself a Canon Powershot G5X, because it was the (seemingly) perfect companion for my holiday purposes. The excitement about this camera was not so great anymore, but I had the hope that I would rediscover photography for myself.

In one of our first conversations he told me about the \u201cprostitutes\u201d in the bohemian neighbourhood called Temple Bar. I was surprised because after couple of years living near Temple Bar I have never seen a sex worker. During the conversation I realized the women he was referring to, as sex workers, were just women wearing mini-skirt \u2013 which is a very common women outfit in Ireland and UK even during winter. For the new comer from Brazil women showing more legs than he was used to see in public had an automatic association to prostitution.  \n\n\nIn my first couple of weeks in Freiburg \u2013 Germany -, when I was looking for a place to live, I was eating in a bar with my mother when a group of 5 men joined our big table. During the conversation they learned we are Brazilians and told us with a big enthusiasm they were going to spend their holidays, in the following month, in Brazil. After a while I asked one of them, who didn\u2019t share the same enthusiasm than the others, if he was going to spend his holidays in Brazil as well. He answered with a gesture of showing his wedding ring on his finger. I suddenly thought he was suggesting that his friends were going to Brazil with sexual intentions, specially because sex tourism in Brazil is very common and many people in Sough Germany\u00a0have the image of Brazilian women as being easy to take to bed \u2013 Since Brazilians are often very attracted to foreigners. Maybe I misinterpreted his gesture, maybe he was just saying that he is not as free to travel as his friends who are single, because of family responsibilities, but I could not help thinking about sex tourism through his silent message.  \n\n\nI think it is interesting the fact that among Brazil, Ireland and Germany the first is the more conservative and moralist when the subject is nudity, which is a false morality to protect them from their own dirty minds. Different from Germany with many parks and saunas where people can spend their time - on their own, with friends or with their families - completely naked . During German\u2019s summer toddlers are running and playing completely nude in their gardens while in Brazil parents are concerned about their toddlers private parts, or even underwear, being exposed in public. In Brazil there are some isolated beaches with nude areas but in general nudity is not tolerated or allowed - not even topless regarding women. In Brazil nudity is automatically associated with sexual provocation. Ireland and the UK don\u2019t have the open air or sauna nude culture as in the Nordic countries but nobody minds women showing their skin. Once a naked woman, walking in the streets in the UK, was stopped by a policeman, not to reprimand her but, to inform her about the law saying that her being nude in public is not an offense, but if somebody complains for feeling offended then it becomes an offense.  \n\n\nAny bath place is supposed to be a place where people don\u2019t need to wear clothes. In South France, where it used to be common for people to be nude in the beaches, people, and specially women, feel less comfortable with nudity because of the new generation of young men who automatic associate nude women as a sign of \u201cavailable to sex\u201d. Women, then, became more frequent victims of harassment.  \n\n\nWhen I started with photography, in Ireland, it was always easy to find people to photograph, especially women. Soon I had my first boudoir photo shoot which for my surprise ended as nude photo shoot. It was a woman who contacted me looking for sensual photos but during the photo shoot she felt comfortable enough to just take out her clothes and continuous the shooting naked. Thanks to her I had photos for my portfolio which brought me more women wanting nude photos, especially after I developed a classic visual language with film negative\u00a0photos that people became attracted to. Most people associate nude photography with pornography - anything can be turned into pornography in fact, it only requires the viewer imagination and intention\\[1\\]\u00a0\u2013 but it is not how I see my work. As a man I am naturally interested in women's beauty and women's bodies but it doesn\u2019t mean I have the sexual view about people I photograph for being naked but the opposite; I have a big respect for people who trust me and my work since most of my photo shoots are just me and the model.  \n\n\nSome people, especially in Brazil, quickly ask me if I sleep with the models I photograph because they can\u2019t help associating nudity to sexual activity. Nudity, instead, gives people a sense of freedom. I only photographed a couple of nude men and it was more evident from them their enthusiasm for being naked - and for having a creative image of their body's expression. I first released\u00a0it when I was photographing a woman who the body seemed stuck during my posing direction. I told her that she doesn\u2019t look comfortable and that I could not get good body composition from her. She then asked me if I could see her private parts, to which I replied saying that I am too focused on the body composition, lighting, camera setting, framing , focus and the image narrative that looking at her private parts never crossed my mind. It seemed to me her worries came from the fact I was photographing her with an old manual film camera, with a slow focus ring in the lens; Because of the system it takes me a little extra time to find the focus before I press the camera shutter release. I tried to explain about the camera to her but she was satisfied with my first explanation; She didn\u2019t want to hear about my camera but go on with the photo shoot, this time feeling completely free with no worries about what in her body may be exposed, even if it appears in the photo. It is through people's eyes where we confirm who we are \\[2\\].  \n\n\nWe fear people's judgement which makes us feel self-conscious. When we are self-conscious, we feel uncomfortable, dissociated from the place and people around us, alien to our surroundings, causing us to cover who we are looking for privacy. Being naked and being accepted as we are without clothes means self-confirmation and so self-acceptance. It gives people more confidence about their body and so about themselves, because they can do whatever they are doing and forget about themselves, feeling more connected to whatever they are doing, enjoying the moment completely and so feeling free. Many people ask me how I convince people to take their clothes off or how I convince women to have certain poses when naked. I never needed to convince anybody to do anything, it was all their decision in the first place, their self-disclosure, to the joy of appearing in the world and deed without equivocation and without self-reflection that are inherent in action\\[3\\].  \n\n\nIn Germany it is much more difficult to have people who want nude photo shoots. Instead of paying me they want to be paid. Often it has to do with the fact that Germans are more cynic for feeling suspicious about people's intentions, especially those who they don\u2019t know. German introversion makes them feel more alienated from people and so more self-conscious, which explains the awkwardness that often Germans have. But this cynicism and uneasy feeling among strangers is not the main reason, it seems. I believe the main reason is because they are more used and so comfortable enough with their naked body in public. Instead of photo shoots, for the creative expression of their body freedom, they rather go to saunas and nude public parks where they can enjoy the freedom of their body without the need of interaction with another person, but on their own or with their family in their introverted manner.  \n\u200b  \nThe ancient Greek had the Polis, the public space where people could interact and become equal to others, which separate them from their private life where people had their own individuality. This public space was for Theseus what enabled ordinary man to bear life\u2019s burden, for providing the safe space for public interaction, but it was also where people hide their individuality in order to become equals and so respect each other \\[4\\]. The medieval Christianity\u00a0thinking and social tradition had no Polis separating the public and the private. People became equal to each other not through a political space designated for political interaction but through every individual, where God becomes ubiquitous in every person's eyes, turning their presence public and their action as action towards God itself \\[5\\]. Consequently, people had to hide more of themselves in order to preserve their individuality. I feel Germans keep something of this separation of public and private tradition, with their closed friend circle as their Polis where they can interact and express themselves to each other as equal, while outside it they can be \u201cnaked\u201d, with no need to hide their individuality in order to preserve it; Or as Germans like to say, \u201c*being direct\u201d*. The Irish, maintaining a more medieval Christian\u00a0tradition, have the public space on every individual eyes who they can interact and express themselves with, in order to bear life burden, but hiding their individuality in order to preserve it. The photo shooting seems to be for the Irish the private sphere where people can be free from the public \u201cburden\u201d but, at the same time, they can appear to the public by showing their individual expression through the photo results, since it is only through others\u2019 eyes we can confirm ourselves. It also seems to be the reason the so-called \u201cGerman directness\u201d is interpreted as rudeness for most westerns. Politeness is in fact against directness; Hiding our true thinking and wish to act, our individuality, to respect those through whom we see ourselves as in the eyes of the public arena \u2013 God ubiquitous. Germans feel free to not hide their true feelings because what the Irish see as public for the Germans is seen as private, the space where people can have their individuality, action without the public \u201cburden\u201d. The German introversion seems to be a preservation of their individuality on what for the Irish is supposed to be public.  \n\n\nIn today\u2019s society there is no such thing as private space other than our own home \\[6\\]. The patriarchal family was supposed to be the private kingship where one can have our individuality freedom apart from the public, the reason the Greeks, originally a matriarchal society, created the Polis as contrast to the private patriarchal kingdom \\[7\\]. God ubiquitous came to replace the Polis during Medieval times. The Equality among people is what is replacing God ubiquitous in today\u2019s society. Universal equality invades even the patriarchal family \u2013 the private kingdom \u2013 in order to assure people\u2019s basic equality rights.  \n\n\n\u200bDifferent cultures find their way to appear and to hide. In order to keep prolific with nude photography, after moving to Germany, I started photographing myself; this time with pinhole cameras which work with long exposure photography. I never felt completely comfortable being nude in public - especially coming from a judging and mocking culture that is strong in Brazil, where the public and the private are merged and confused as attempt to find their individual expression and, at the same time, afraid of losing both all together \u2013 but doing my creative work, that now included my own body expression, made me feel very good and more comfortable in my own body. Like a work of art which we create from our own expression, the body then becomes a work of art \u2013 or it has always been - through which we find our individuality in our nudity and, at the same time, our public expression through the image result. The public where we confirm our own self narrative, which without we have no identity.\n\n  \n\\----\n\n\u200b\\[1\\] HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros. Separata de; HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros: Essays.

In one of our first conversations he told me about the \u201cprostitutes\u201d in the bohemian neighbourhood called Temple Bar. I was surprised because after couple of years living near Temple Bar I have never seen a sex worker. During the conversation I realized the women he was referring to, as sex workers, were just women wearing mini-skirt \u2013 which is a very common women outfit in Ireland and UK even during winter. For the new comer from Brazil women showing more legs than he was used to see in public had an automatic association to prostitution.  \n\n\nIn my first couple of weeks in Freiburg \u2013 Germany -, when I was looking for a place to live, I was eating in a bar with my mother when a group of 5 men joined our big table. During the conversation they learned we are Brazilians and told us with a big enthusiasm they were going to spend their holidays, in the following month, in Brazil. After a while I asked one of them, who didn\u2019t share the same enthusiasm than the others, if he was going to spend his holidays in Brazil as well. He answered with a gesture of showing his wedding ring on his finger. I suddenly thought he was suggesting that his friends were going to Brazil with sexual intentions, specially because sex tourism in Brazil is very common and many people in Sough Germany\u00a0have the image of Brazilian women as being easy to take to bed \u2013 Since Brazilians are often very attracted to foreigners. Maybe I misinterpreted his gesture, maybe he was just saying that he is not as free to travel as his friends who are single, because of family responsibilities, but I could not help thinking about sex tourism through his silent message.  \n\n\nI think it is interesting the fact that among Brazil, Ireland and Germany the first is the more conservative and moralist when the subject is nudity, which is a false morality to protect them from their own dirty minds. Different from Germany with many parks and saunas where people can spend their time - on their own, with friends or with their families - completely naked . During German\u2019s summer toddlers are running and playing completely nude in their gardens while in Brazil parents are concerned about their toddlers private parts, or even underwear, being exposed in public. In Brazil there are some isolated beaches with nude areas but in general nudity is not tolerated or allowed - not even topless regarding women. In Brazil nudity is automatically associated with sexual provocation. Ireland and the UK don\u2019t have the open air or sauna nude culture as in the Nordic countries but nobody minds women showing their skin. Once a naked woman, walking in the streets in the UK, was stopped by a policeman, not to reprimand her but, to inform her about the law saying that her being nude in public is not an offense, but if somebody complains for feeling offended then it becomes an offense.  \n\n\nAny bath place is supposed to be a place where people don\u2019t need to wear clothes. In South France, where it used to be common for people to be nude in the beaches, people, and specially women, feel less comfortable with nudity because of the new generation of young men who automatic associate nude women as a sign of \u201cavailable to sex\u201d. Women, then, became more frequent victims of harassment.  \n\n\nWhen I started with photography, in Ireland, it was always easy to find people to photograph, especially women. Soon I had my first boudoir photo shoot which for my surprise ended as nude photo shoot. It was a woman who contacted me looking for sensual photos but during the photo shoot she felt comfortable enough to just take out her clothes and continuous the shooting naked. Thanks to her -----> I !!!  had photos for my portfolio which brought me more women wanting nude photos, especially after -----> -----> I !!!  developed !!!  a classic visual language with film negative\u00a0photos that people became attracted to. Most people associate nude photography with pornography - anything can be turned into pornography in fact, it only requires the viewer imagination and intention\\[1\\]\u00a0\u2013 but it is not how I see my work. As a man I am naturally interested in women's beauty and women's bodies but it doesn\u2019t mean I have the sexual view about people I photograph for being naked but the opposite; I have a big respect for people who trust me and my work since most of my photo shoots are just me and the model.  \n\n\nSome people, especially in Brazil, quickly ask me if I sleep with the models I photograph because they can\u2019t help associating nudity to sexual activity. Nudity, instead, gives people a sense of freedom. I only photographed a couple of nude men and it was more evident from them their enthusiasm for being naked - and for having a creative image of their body's expression. I first released\u00a0it when I was photographing a woman who the body seemed stuck during my posing direction. I told her that she doesn\u2019t look comfortable and that I could not get good body composition from her. She then asked me if I could see her private parts, to which I replied saying that I am too focused on the body composition, lighting, camera setting, framing , focus and the image narrative that looking at her private parts never crossed my mind. It seemed to me her worries came from the fact I was photographing her with an old manual film camera, with a slow focus ring in the lens; Because of the system it takes me a little extra time to find the focus before I press the camera shutter release. I tried to explain about the camera to her but she was satisfied with my first explanation; She didn\u2019t want to hear about my camera but go on with the photo shoot, this time feeling completely free with no worries about what in her body may be exposed, even if it appears in the photo. It is through people's eyes where we confirm who we are \\[2\\].  \n\n\nWe fear people's judgement which makes us feel self-conscious. When we are self-conscious, we feel uncomfortable, dissociated from the place and people around us, alien to our surroundings, causing us to cover who we are looking for privacy. Being naked and being accepted as we are without clothes means self-confirmation and so self-acceptance. It gives people more confidence about their body and so about themselves, because they can do whatever they are doing and forget about themselves, feeling more connected to whatever they are doing, enjoying the moment completely and so feeling free. Many people ask me how I convince people to take their clothes off or how I convince women to have certain poses when naked. I never needed to convince anybody to do anything, it was all their decision in the first place, their self-disclosure, to the joy of appearing in the world and deed without equivocation and without self-reflection that are inherent in action\\[3\\].  \n\n\nIn Germany it is much more difficult to have people who want nude photo shoots. Instead of paying me they want to be paid. Often it has to do with the fact that Germans are more cynic for feeling suspicious about people's intentions, especially those who they don\u2019t know. German introversion makes them feel more alienated from people and so more self-conscious, which explains the awkwardness that often Germans have. But this cynicism and uneasy feeling among strangers is not the main reason, it seems. I believe the main reason is because they are more used and so comfortable enough with their naked body in public. Instead of photo shoots, for the creative expression of their body freedom, they rather go to saunas and nude public parks where they can enjoy the freedom of their body without the need of interaction with another person, but on their own or with their family in their introverted manner.  \n\u200b  \nThe ancient Greek had the Polis, the public space where people could interact and become equal to others, which separate them from their private life where people had their own individuality. This public space was for Theseus what enabled ordinary man to bear life\u2019s burden, for providing the safe space for public interaction, but it was also where people hide their individuality in order to become equals and so respect each other \\[4\\]. The medieval Christianity\u00a0thinking and social tradition had no Polis separating the public and the private. People became equal to each other not through a political space designated for political interaction but through every individual, where God becomes ubiquitous in every person's eyes, turning their presence public and their action as action towards God itself \\[5\\]. Consequently, people had to hide more of themselves in order to preserve their individuality. I feel Germans keep something of this separation of public and private tradition, with their closed friend circle as their Polis where they can interact and express themselves to each other as equal, while outside it they can be \u201cnaked\u201d, with no need to hide their individuality in order to preserve it; Or as Germans like to say, \u201c*being direct\u201d*. The Irish, maintaining a more medieval Christian\u00a0tradition, have the public space on every individual eyes who they can interact and express themselves with, in order to bear life burden, but hiding their individuality in order to preserve it. The photo shooting seems to be for the Irish the private sphere where people can be free from the public \u201cburden\u201d but, at the same time, they can appear to the public by showing their individual expression through the photo results, since it is only through others\u2019 eyes we can confirm ourselves. It also seems to be the reason the so-called \u201cGerman directness\u201d is interpreted as rudeness for most westerns. Politeness is in fact against directness; Hiding our true thinking and wish to act, our individuality, to respect those through whom we see ourselves as in the eyes of the public arena \u2013 God ubiquitous. Germans feel free to not hide their true feelings because what the Irish see as public for the Germans is seen as private, the space where people can have their individuality, action without the public \u201cburden\u201d. The German introversion seems to be a preservation of their individuality on what for the Irish is supposed to be public.  \n\n\nIn today\u2019s society there is no such thing as private space other than our own home \\[6\\]. The patriarchal family was supposed to be the private kingship where one can have our individuality freedom apart from the public, the reason the Greeks, originally a matriarchal society, created the Polis as contrast to the private patriarchal kingdom \\[7\\]. God ubiquitous came to replace the Polis during Medieval times. The Equality among people is what is replacing God ubiquitous in today\u2019s society. Universal equality invades even the patriarchal family \u2013 the private kingdom \u2013 in order to assure people\u2019s basic equality rights.  \n\n\n\u200bDifferent cultures find their way to appear and to hide. In order to keep prolific with nude photography, after moving to Germany, I started photographing myself; this time with pinhole cameras which work with long exposure photography. I never felt completely comfortable being nude in public - especially coming from a judging and mocking culture that is strong in Brazil, where the public and the private are merged and confused as attempt to find their individual expression and, at the same time, afraid of losing both all together \u2013 but doing my creative work, that now included my own body expression, made me feel very good and more comfortable in my own body. Like a work of art which we create from our own expression, the body then becomes a work of art \u2013 or it has always been - through which we find our individuality in our nudity and, at the same time, our public expression through the image result. The public where we confirm our own self narrative, which without we have no identity.\n\n  \n\\----\n\n\u200b\\[1\\] HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros. Separata de; HUSTVEDT, S. A Plea for Eros: Essays.

It's raining here for weeks already with not the greatest conditions for landscape photography, so I took out my macro lens to photograph some mushrooms in the forest. The great thing about this is that you can do this with any kind of light at any moment of the day. \n\nThe mushrooms are (in NL at least) literally everywhere and you can find them especially on wet trees that fell down in forests. Now this was actually the first time I went out to photograph these mushrooms, and I immediately got addicted! So I can recommend this to anyone who loves this style of photography :) I planned to only go to the forest for about an hour, but I stayed the whole day with so much muscle pain as a result (had to lower myself all the time to shoot the tiny mushrooms on the forest floor). Here are some images and tips that I came up with:\n\n\\- Get very low. The prettiest mushrooms are often the tiniest. Sometimes you don't even see them immediately. They can be on fallen trees or directly on the forest floor. You don't want to photograph them at an angle, but from the same height as were they are. So get low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbo1fxui4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21a086012729652e7fe83751e70474ca3317f62\n\n\\- The background is more important than the subject. This was what I found most important when photographing these little guys. By moving the camera just a few mm, the composition and background completely changes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9rnctrk4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b49009e4eecb73797a1d55a32ce40f0d4809f0\n\n\\- Use foreground bokeh. By getting low with your camera and having some leaves or grass in front of your lens, you'll have both dreamy foreground blur AND background blur. You can also use red leaves and put them in front of your lens a bit to create that autumn feeling. This way you create more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A red leaf in the foreground gives that extra depth](https://preview.redd.it/zrrqu95m4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17929506f305565f15a1af58b566d4551b48629)\n\n\\- Use a macro lens or extension tubes. All of these images were made with a 90mm macro. Its my favourite focal length to shoot these kind of shots. You can also get extension tubes for your lens to be able to focus closer to do macro shots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12z39wnw4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0b0a90465b4661cb4cb60371470623978330d73\n\n\\- Use a wide open aperture for extremely dreamy look. I almost always use my macro lens wide open at f/2.8. This way the depth of field is very tiny, and it allows me to create these very dreamy shots.\n\n\\- Find single little mushrooms. There are often big packs of mushrooms that can be very tempting to photograph. But the most beautiful ones are often the very tiny single ones. Because you can make beautiful framing of a single little mushroom with the dreamy background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbieldxr4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fdf83ece48b63473a558e37a38e4bd81322ec9\n\n\\- Photograph them slightly from below so you can see the texture inside. This is something I only noticed later. As a newbie mushroom photographer, I had to 'learn' that they looked so beautiful from the inside. They're often very tiny and low on the ground, so getting below them can be tricky. It gets easier when they're on a tree. By getting lower and photographing them from below, you'll see the beautiful textures in the mushrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj76n8rt4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0558aaa8cf5f7ba5bf9cd0e2798909c1a842ea\n\n\\- A flip screen is super handy. If you don't have a flip screen you basically need to lie on the ground to see what you're doing. I was able to take all these shots by crouching down and looking at my flip screen. Makes things a little bit easier\n\n\\- Use hand held. Some people might disagree with this tip. But I shot all of these images hand held. By using the camera hand held I was able to very quickly switch up my angles and composition. Focusing is HARD though, and the forest is often dark. So most of these images are taken at ISO 400-500. If you're shooting on a tripod, you'll want to shoot with your center column upside down so that you can place your camera very low to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlujc4cv4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2c06612f84b268ba5a9fecd366125c80d440a6\n\n\\- Bring something to sit on. Now as I was saying, I crouched for almost all of these shots. As a result of hours doing this, I have so much muscle pain today :D Next time I'll bring a cloth to sit on, it makes things so much easier!\n\nNow I don't consider myself a pro at macro photography, so feel free to give me any tips as well :) I really enjoyed photographing these mushrooms and it's almost like an entire new tiny world. I'll go back soon to shoot more. You can find more of my work on my [website](https://www.albertdros.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/albertdrosphotography).

If you're shooting on a tripod, you'll want to shoot with your center column upside down so that you can place your camera very low to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlujc4cv4ns51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2c06612f84b268ba5a9fecd366125c80d440a6\n\n\\- Bring something to sit on. Now as I was saying, I crouched for almost all of these shots. As a result of hours doing this, I have so much muscle pain today :D Next time I'll bring a cloth to sit on, it makes things so much easier!\n\nNow I don't consider myself a pro at macro photography, so feel free to give me any tips as well :) I really enjoyed photographing these mushrooms and it's almost like an entire new tiny world. I'll go back soon to shoot more. You can find more of my work on my [website](https://www.albertdros.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/albertdrosphotography).
