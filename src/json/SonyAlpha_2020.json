I was having a hard time finding a conversion LUT for HLG and the Leeming LUT didn't work that well, so I created my own. Please try them out I want to hear your feedback. Also if you want to see any other conversion LUTs Just let me know.\n\nThe picture Profile settings I use are Gamma: HLG3, Gamut: BT.2020, Detail:-7. All the other settings I leave default. Any of The HLG gammas should work I just prefer HLG3.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E-Fs\\_UunhZf7kRaIDJWHtNX56AIibGsI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E-Fs_UunhZf7kRaIDJWHtNX56AIibGsI/view?usp=sharing)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/fyn55n/free_sony_hlg_to_rec709_conversion_lut/"}, {"autor": "justingrowninbc", "selftext": "nan", "title": "A Stadium Behind the Towers. a6500 | 55-210mm | f6.3 | LR edit | PS unsharp mask | File compressed ~80% | Please let me know what I can improve on.", "num-comments": 0, "score": 1, "date": "2020-06-02 21:09:33", "content": "A Stadium Behind the Towers. a6500 | 55-210mm | f6.3 | LR edit | PS unsharp mask | File compressed ~80% | Please let -----> me !!!  know what -----> I can improve !!!  on.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/gvfwo8/a_stadium_behind_the_towers_a6500_55210mm_f63_lr/"}, {"autor": "Cherryheadedx", "selftext": "(Link to recent pictures at the end) \nI\u2019ve always used single shot non manual cameras and I\u2019ve dabbled with a canon t6 but this is my first real step up.
