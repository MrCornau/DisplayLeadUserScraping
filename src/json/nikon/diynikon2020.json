This lens predates the AI aperture ring, and also has a 72mm filter diameter.\n\nPosing this question to long-time Nikon shooters, or even people who have done a DIY AI conversion process on a Pre-AI lens.\n\nI bought a used 20mm f/3.5 Nikkor-UD lens with good glass, and good mechanicals. The only problem is that this particular copy has a improper aperture ring modification. \n\nThe previous owner of my lens attempted to do his own AI conversion by shaving off several mm of the bottom of the aperture ring. Because there was nothing left on the aperture ring to catch onto the aperture coupling ring, the former owner drilled a tiny screw into the aperture ring. \n\nThe problem is that the screw is a few mm off from where it should be for a lens with f/3.5 maximum aperture. When I open this lens to maximum aperture, or even f/4, the screw doesn't catch onto the aperture coupling ring until I stop the lens down to f/5.6. The result is that I can't meter reliably if the lens aperture is opened wide. I think this is a rather serious limitation. \n\nI've thought about what to do about this problem. I've considered working around the problem by using this lens on a Nikon F3 or Nikon F4 with the metering tab flipped up. This method allows me to shoot this lens with stop-down metering. I suppose I could also only use the lens at  f/5.6 or higher, but this is also very limiting. \n\nAs for fixing the problem, I'm not sure if it's worth the time. I've come up with three possible fixes:\n\n1. Re-drill the screw into the right spot\n2. Swap the aperture ring with another one\n3. Find Nikon's specific AI conversion kit, and install that in place of the original aperture ring\n\nI'm not comfortable with the idea of drilling a second hole into the aperture ring, as I have no experience doing so. The second and third options don't seem very feasible either; I would somehow have to find a spare aperture ring for this lens which is unlikely nowadays. The third option is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, because Nikon stopped making the AI conversion kits several decades ago.\n\nAny thoughts on this problem would be greatly appreciated.
