It is the kind of thing you need to read before having the problem to avoid losing more than necessary as it is very important to stop writing to the card. You can jump BACKGROUND if you are not interested in technical details.\n\nIf there is interest, I will try to test some (free) recovery softwares to list as alternatives.\n\n**BACKGROUND** \n\nFAT (File Allocation Table) designs a series of file systems developed from 1977 that became widely used with their adoption by MSDOS. Afterwards, the simplicity, availability in most operating systems, and low overhead of FAT made it attractive for usage in a number of devices, such as digital cameras. \n\nA file system works in term of blocks, because of the underlying storage hardware such as hard disks. Each read or write to a hard disk is made in terms of sectors of 512 or 4096 bytes, usually. Hence, a block is usually made up of a number of sectors. \n\nIn FAT lingo, a block is called a cluster (but it is still a block). Each file is composed by a list of clusters. The list itself is stored in the File Allocation Table, a vector with one position for each cluster that is also stored in the same storage as the file system itself. The size of an entry in the FAT is measured in bits and dictates the maximum number of clusters that can be indexed and thus the maximum size of a file system. For example, FAT12 means entries of 12 bits that can index up to 2^12 clusters. If the cluster size is 1 KB, this means that the file system can approximately store 2^12 KB, which is 4 MB. Hence, to store more than 4 MB, the cluster size must be increased.\n\nEach directory stores file descriptors that contain important information about files, such as their size and the first cluster. For example, suppose that a file starts at cluster 4. The 4th entry in FAT will have the index of the next cluster (in this case 5), which will have the next index and so on until an entry that points to end of file.\n\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ....\n    - - - 5 7 - 8 - \n\nFAT is very important and, if the clusters where it is stored go corrupt, then it is not possible (or very hard) to extract the complete files from the file system. That is why it is usually stored twice in a file system. \n\nFormatting a file system means to set up the structures required to store the files, such as directories and FATs.\n\n**RECOVERING FILES**\n\nOne important thing in storage is that data is not erased the moment you format the disk or delete the file. Some of it will be overwritten for the format process (such as FAT) but the data stored in the remaining clusters are usually just marked as deleted. In a solid storage technology such as used in SD cards, the memory cells must be reseted before writing on them again, but that process is not instantaneous. Hence, if you act fast enough and block your card from being written on, you should be able to recover most files.\n\nI recommend that you take the card out of the camera, set it to read-only if possible (SD cards may come with a small plastic slider for that) and then bring it to a computer with a recovery tool. Do NOT keep shooting with the card or files will be overwritten by the new pictures.\n\nAfterwards, you should use a tool to read the card and recover the erased files. There are many alternative softwares for that [2], but I don't have a specific one to recommend here.\n\nThe way digital cameras work (writing each file in a single operation) imply that files will most likely be stored in consecutive blocks, making the life for the recovery software easier. Each JPEG or RAW file starts with a magic number [3], making them easier to be recognized even if the file descriptor is lost.\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table)\n\n[2](https://lifehacker.com/5951822/how-can-i-recover-data-from-a-dead-or-erased-hard-drive)\n\n[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/8k605k/how_to_recovery_pictures_in_a_formatted_card/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "how to recovery pictures in a formatted card /!/ i have seen some people asking for help with erased pictures, and thus i thought of writing a small howto. it is the kind of thing you need to read before having the problem to avoid losing more than necessary as it is very important to stop writing to the card. you can jump background if you are not interested in technical details.\n\nif there is interest, i will try to test some (free) recovery softwares to list as alternatives.\n\n**background** \n\nfat (file allocation table) designs a series of file systems developed from 1977 that became widely used with their adoption by msdos. afterwards, the simplicity, availability in most operating systems, and low overhead of fat made it attractive for usage in a number of devices, such as digital cameras. \n\na file system works in term of blocks, because of the underlying storage hardware such as hard disks. each read or write to a hard disk is made in terms of sectors of 512 or 4096 bytes, usually. hence, a block is usually made up of a number of sectors. \n\nin fat lingo, a block is called a cluster (but it is still a block). each file is composed by a list of clusters. the list itself is stored in the file allocation table, a vector with one -----> position !!!  for each cluster that is also stored in the same storage as the file system itself. the size of an entry in the fat is measured in bits and dictates the maximum number of clusters that can be indexed and thus the maximum size of a file system. for example, fat12 means entries of 12 bits that can index up to 2^12 clusters. if the cluster size is 1 kb, this means that the file system can approximately store 2^12 kb, which is 4 mb. hence, to store more than 4 mb, the cluster size must be increased.\n\neach directory stores file descriptors that contain important information about files, such as their size and the first cluster. for example, suppose that a file starts at cluster 4. the 4th entry in fat will have the index of the next cluster (in this case 5), which will have the next index and so on until an entry that points to end of file.\n\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ....\n    - - - 5 7 - 8 - \n\nfat is very important and, if the clusters where it is stored go corrupt, then it is not possible (or very hard) to extract the complete files from the file system. that is why it is usually stored twice in a file system. \n\nformatting a file system means to set up the structures required to store the files, such as directories and fats.\n\n**recovering files**\n\none important thing in storage is that data is not erased the moment you format the disk or delete the file. some of it will be overwritten for the format process (such as fat) but the data stored in the remaining clusters are usually just marked as deleted. in a solid storage technology such as used in sd cards, the memory cells must be reseted before writing on them again, but that process is not instantaneous. hence, if you act fast enough and block your card from being written on, you should be able to recover most files.\n\ni recommend that you take the card out of the camera, set it to read-only if possible (sd cards may come with a small plastic slider for that) and then bring it to a computer with a recovery tool. do not keep shooting with the card or files will be overwritten by the new pictures.\n\nafterwards, you should use a tool to read the card and recover the erased files. there are many alternative softwares for that [2], but i don't have a specific one to recommend here.\n\nthe way digital cameras work (writing each file in a single operation) imply that files will most likely be stored in consecutive blocks, making the life for the recovery software easier. each jpeg or raw file starts with a magic number [3], making them easier to be recognized even if the file descriptor is lost.\n\n\n**references**\n\n[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file_allocation_table)\n\n[2](https://lifehacker.com/5951822/how-can-i-recover-data-from-a-dead-or-erased-hard-drive)\n\n[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_file_signatures)\n", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 44211, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 249110, "autor": "ZippyDan", "date": 1520919063000, "content": "Nikon as an adventure camera /!/ I love my Nikon.  Used a D3100 for many years, and have now been using a D750 for two years.\n\nI travel a lot.  I hike a lot.  I walk around many cities and countrysides in many different countries.  I try to wear my Nikon wherever I go, so I will always be ready to capture something.\n\nBoth Nikon and Canon advertise themselves as cameras for field work, and I've seen plenty of examples of both in use in the field.  I've also seen them both advertised for their ruggedness and durability.\n\nI don't baby my Nikon at all.  I use a sling style strap (BlackRapid, for which I also have praise and criticism), and the camera tends to roll and bounce around at my hip somewhat.  I've often used my Nikon in light rain with no protection or in below freezing temperatures and no problems at all.  I've scrambled up boulders, I've navigated tight urban centers, I've laid on dirty grounds, and sometimes my Nikon was thwacked against a rock or wall or gotten covered in dust and dirt.  Through it all my Nikon has performed and I'm pleased with its overall ruggedness.\n\nThere are a few niggling issues though that drive me crazy, because they seem like they would and should be so easy to solve in an age of modern design and manufacturing, and after so many generations of Nikon DSLRs, and especially for high-end professional field cameras.\n\nNamely: why the fuck are all my accessories always falling off?\n\n1. Lens cap - I've lost so many of these.  Surely they could use stronger springs, or simply rethink the way a lens cap secures itself to a lens.  Sometimes the slightest bump will send the cap flying, and depending on the precariousness of my position that sometimes means bye forever.  And a few times it has happened and I didn't even notice it until later.  And those lens caps are freaking expensive for a piece of plastic.  And using a third party lens just makes the situation worse since they are even more liable to fall off.  Anyway, it ended up getting to the point that my lens cap was spending more time clipped to my sling than on my lens.  Then I decided that there is no point carrying a lens cap that I don't even use, and I just let my NC filter do the job of protecting my lens.  Of course, the filter is now scratched to heck (and also fucking expensive).  I'm sure that affects the quality of my photographs but what other option do I have left at this point?  Unscrew my NC before each shot?  Lol.  The only time I use a lens cap now is when the lens is off the camera and in my bag.\n\n2. Lens hood - fuck, this thing is even more expensive than the lens cap.  Thankfully I haven't lost this yet (I did have to buy a new one once because I broke one), but it has fallen off several times.  I think it is the slight rolling action on my hip as I walk that slowly works it loose.  Im actually very sure of this because I notice my kit zoom lens also likes to zoom itself out every time I let it hang.  But here's the thing: I've never had my lens fall off my camera body.  Surely there must be a more secure attachment method that could be designed for a lens hood.\n\n3. Eye piece - goddamn it again.  I've used both the rubber eye piece and the magnification piece and I've lost both so many times I have also lost count.  I assume, again, that they work their way loose while rubbing up against my body.  I'm constantly finding them slightly loose so I'm pretty obsessive about pushing them down back into place whenever I grab my camera, but sometimes after a long walk or trip without using my camera (it is just hanging at my waist), I'll grab it to take a pic and, fuck, the eye piece is gone and who knows when or where it fell off.\n\nAnyone else find this annoying on their Nikon?  Is the fault mine for using a sling strap (surely these are very common in the photographer world)?  Am I doing something wrong?  Any tips to mitigate these issues?  For example, I'm thinking I'm going to try finding a very small, very strong rubber band to wrap around my eye piece and see if that helps to keep it attached.  I've also wondered if it would be possible to mod the lens cap with stronger springs.

However, after using this lens for a couple of weeks, I returned it to the Used Department at B&amp;H, glad that I came to my senses and bought it from them before completing a deal with someone from Craig\u2019s List, who wanted me to meet him at his \u2018kinda beat up truck\u2019 in a dead mall parking lot--with $1200 in cash.  And in this short time of ownership, I took some lovely images that I doubt I could have captured with my ancient, early edition 70-200 2.8, so it was with great reluctance that I decided to let it go. \n\nWhy?  Because it is too big, too heavy and too unwieldy for me to shoot with for long stretches in the field, tracking birds and wildlife.  It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a petite slip of a thing; no, I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d  (175.25 cm) and have adequate arm and upper body strength from years of working out with hand weights.   \u201cWell, didn\u2019t you read the reviews?\u201d  you may be asking.  Of course I did, but aside from SnapChick on YouTube, I think they were all written or videoed by men and while they may have mentioned the lens\u2019 size and heft, they seemed to downplay its significance and did not consider it a rule-out factor in their recommendations.  (Check out the YouTube review by Jurgen Vogt and watch how easily he chucks the lens back and forth between his left hand and right.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkBorh0obM&amp;t=111s)\n\nShooting birds in flight or even roosted high in trees means holding the camera and lens in an angled-upward position, which, after about a half hour of shooting, I could only do for maybe a minute at most before my arms began to tremble beyond the ability of the 4-stop VR to overcome.  So, I\u2019d rest and do it again, and again, until the intervals between rest and shaking grew too short to capture anything worth keeping.  I suppose I could increase strength over time and do okay, but then there\u2019s this next factor.\n\nThe circumference of the lens barrel at its greatest point is about 13\u201d (33 cm), roughly the same as that of a Costco-sized jar of Jif peanut butter; my left hand measures 7\u201d (17.8 cm) from the tip of my middle finger to the base of my palm.  When adjusting the zoom, which takes several twists of the barrel, I\u2019d shift lens support away from the left hand while my right hand continued to cradle the camera and fire the shutter, further accelerating the fatigue factor.   In other words, my hand just isn\u2019t big enough and my arm isn\u2019t strong enough to twirl the barrel and support the lens at the same time.\n\nA third concern is the fear that I had that this whole rig was going to slip out of my hands, into a stream or onto rocks and, well, bye-bye to ~$3000 worth of gear.  Since I like to get off paths and down steep, muddy hillsides to shoot streams and flowing water, in addition to whatever wildlife I\u2019m likely to find, I was hesitant to give up at least one hand to carry this awkward bundle.  \n\nSo where to go from here?  I\u2019m looking at two options:  the first is to add a teleconverter to the 70-200, and then invest in a used 300 mm f4 PF when I can find one at some point in the future.  I didn\u2019t write this to complain, rather, I wanted to add a different perspective\u2014a woman\u2019s perspective\u2014to the many reviews of the Nikon 200-500mm lens already out there.  I\u2019d love to hear what other women shooters have to say about this lens, what their experiences have been, and how they\u2019ve been more successful in using it than I was.  \n\ntl/dr:  The 200-500mm lens yields terrific images and I like several of its features a lot, but its size and weight make it impractical for my use.\n\n\n \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/8h9xk7/a_womans_view_of_the_fabulous_200500_lens/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "position", "selectorShort": "position", "MarkedSent": "a woman's view of the fabulous 200-500 lens /!/ what\u2019s been said about the 200-500 is true:  it renders sharp images with beautiful bokeh, pairs well with the d500 but the af is a bit boggy, and the 4-stop vr really works.  however, after using this lens for a couple of weeks, i returned it to the used department at b&amp;h, glad that i came to my senses and bought it from them before completing a deal with someone from craig\u2019s list, who wanted me to meet him at his \u2018kinda beat up truck\u2019 in a dead mall parking lot--with $1200 in cash.  and in this short time of ownership, i took some lovely images that i doubt i could have captured with my ancient, early edition 70-200 2.8, so it was with great reluctance that i decided to let it go. \n\nwhy?  because it is too big, too heavy and too unwieldy for me to shoot with for long stretches in the field, tracking birds and wildlife.  it\u2019s not that i\u2019m a petite slip of a thing; no, i\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d  (175.25 cm) and have adequate arm and upper body strength from years of working out with hand weights.   \u201cwell, didn\u2019t you read the reviews?\u201d  you may be asking.  of course i did, but aside from snapchick on youtube, i think they were all written or videoed by men and while they may have mentioned the lens\u2019 size and heft, they seemed to downplay its significance and did not consider it a rule-out factor in their recommendations.  (check out the youtube review by jurgen vogt and watch how easily he chucks the lens back and forth between his left hand and right.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkborh0obm&amp;t=111s)\n\nshooting birds in flight or even roosted high in trees means holding the camera and lens in an angled-upward -----> position !!! , which, after about a half hour of shooting, i could only do for maybe a minute at most before my arms began to tremble beyond the ability of the 4-stop vr to overcome.  so, i\u2019d rest and do it again, and again, until the intervals between rest and shaking grew too short to capture anything worth keeping.  i suppose i could increase strength over time and do okay, but then there\u2019s this next factor.\n\nthe circumference of the lens barrel at its greatest point is about 13\u201d (33 cm), roughly the same as that of a costco-sized jar of jif peanut butter; my left hand measures 7\u201d (17.8 cm) from the tip of my middle finger to the base of my palm.  when adjusting the zoom, which takes several twists of the barrel, i\u2019d shift lens support away from the left hand while my right hand continued to cradle the camera and fire the shutter, further accelerating the fatigue factor.   in other words, my hand just isn\u2019t big enough and my arm isn\u2019t strong enough to twirl the barrel and support the lens at the same time.\n\na third concern is the fear that i had that this whole rig was going to slip out of my hands, into a stream or onto rocks and, well, bye-bye to ~$3000 worth of gear.  since i like to get off paths and down steep, muddy hillsides to shoot streams and flowing water, in addition to whatever wildlife i\u2019m likely to find, i was hesitant to give up at least one hand to carry this awkward bundle.  \n\nso where to go from here?  i\u2019m looking at two options:  the first is to add a teleconverter to the 70-200, and then invest in a used 300 mm f4 pf when i can find one at some point in the future.  i didn\u2019t write this to complain, rather, i wanted to add a different perspective\u2014a woman\u2019s perspective\u2014to the many reviews of the nikon 200-500mm lens already out there.  i\u2019d love to hear what other women shooters have to say about this lens, what their experiences have been, and how they\u2019ve been more successful in using it than i was.  \n\ntl/dr:  the 200-500mm lens yields terrific images and i like several of its features a lot, but its size and weight make it impractical for my use.\n\n\n \n\n", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 47459, "year": "2018"}], "name": "positionnikon2018"}
