However, there's an issue with the dual plate: it is not symmetric. This is a problem because when the camera is mounted on a nodal slider, the camera points to the left/right of the slider/tripod instead of the front. Does anyone know if the Zayla PD mount is symmetric? By the photos it's hard to tell but it looks like it is.\n\nI'll be using it mainly to get panorama shots using one nodal slider.\n\nThank you!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/ov7b9h/lbracket_for_nikon_z50/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "l-bracket for nikon z50 /!/ hi everyone,\n\ni'm looking for a l-bracket for my z50 and was wondering what everyone else was using?\n\ni'm having some trouble deciding what to buy for 2 main reasons:\n\n* given the current road -----> map !!!  for mirrorless dx i'm not sure if i'm going to upgrade to fx (budget allowing \ud83e\udd1e) in the next couple of years so is it best to buy something like the 3leggedthinsg zayla that only fits the z50 or should i buy a universal l-bracket?\n\n* i have a peak design capture with the dual plate,as such, i am considering the 3leggedthinsg zayla so i can keep using it. however, there's an issue with the dual plate: it is not symmetric. this is a problem because when the camera is mounted on a nodal slider, the camera points to the left/right of the slider/tripod instead of the front. does anyone know if the zayla pd mount is symmetric? by the photos it's hard to tell but it looks like it is.\n\ni'll be using it mainly to get panorama shots using one nodal slider.\n\nthank you!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 46278, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 157380, "autor": "Shittalker23", "date": 1612415496000, "content": "My kid playing with a constellation map.
