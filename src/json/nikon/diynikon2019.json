He was a \u201cprofessional\u201d in the way that you are when you take less money to do weddings and events because they are people you know who can\u2019t afford a professional that charges like one. He passed away just more than 2 years ago, and it hit me really hard. When he passed I learned to golf, and that made me feel good, so now I\u2019m going to study some photography. It was never something he shared with me, he never let me touch his camera, but that doesn\u2019t bother me now. I was tempted by the new Sony \u201cgod camera\u201d and its 61 mp plus it\u2019s wonderful ability to track eyes in focus, but my dad never had the Nikon he wanted, so I wanted to have the best Nikon kind of for him, and I figured if I was gonna spend any of my meager inheritance on anything for myself, that he would at least respect and appreciate the purchase. Went with the Z7 for the first party lenses as well. I\u2019m hopeful that the Chinese made kit 24-70, 14-30 and 85prime last as long as my dads lenses did. His lenses were sold at auction unfortunately. I couldn\u2019t be there, so Hopefully someone got a deal.\n\n I\u2019m newly of California and an outdoors person who does a lot of hiking and spends a lot of time in the water as well. I love birds, but I won\u2019t be buying a \u201cbig\u201d lens anytime soon. I also want to do portraits with the 85mm z lens. I have a small dog I wish to immortalize in \u2018film\u2019 , as well as product shots from a brand new business I\u2019m trying to start.
