{"interestingcomments": [{"autor": "tacos-alpastor", "date": "2020-11-18 18:54:07", "content": "What should be my next camera? /!/ So I was introduced to the world of photography about 2 years ago. I had a friend in college that happened to have a red Nikon D3300 available, and that she offered to sell at a relatively cheap price. I had zero knowledge about cameras, lenses, brands, etc. So I agreed at the time because a friend of mine suggested that it wasn't that bad of a camera for beginner photograpers - now I know he had a Canon with even lower specs than the camera I bought - so he convinced me to go for it since it would perform just fine for the work I was doing and because of the quality/price balance I was being offered. \n\nSo now 2 years after, I've gotten to know my camera a whole lot better, the camera's sensor really kicks butt when used properly, those 24mpx can give me some crispy clear shots. So I've gotta say that my friend was right, the D3300 is way more than what meets the eye. I still have the kit lens and about a year ago I bought the 85mm f1.8 lens. My photography has improved a whole lot since (I do a bit of everything: street, architecture and portrait photography).\n\nSo now that I'm a bit more experienced, I've also gotten to notice the faults the camera also possesses, for example:\n\u2022 While recording (or movie mode), the camera really struggles dealing with blacks and shadows, limiting my possibilities of recording in low light situations.\n\u2022 Autofocus is laughable, constantly popping in and out and forcing me to simpler shots that can only be handled with manual focus.\n\u2022 LCD screen is fixed, also limiting the flexibility that some of the shots should have.\n\nSo now that I'm not necessarily an amateur, I've really started to think about upgrading. I don't know if I should sell all my gear to switch brands, or if I should stick with Nikon to keep the 85mm lens. The Nikon z50 has been the apple of my eye as of recently, but it bothers me that the mount is different to the one I currently have for the 85. I've checked Canon and Fujifilm cameras but I've really grown a soft spot for Nikon because of my buddy, the D3300.\n\nBottom line: I don't know what I should do next. The amount of cameras and specs still overwhelms me, so I need guidance, also, I live in a third world country (Mexico), so saving money to buy/switch gear can be a bit of a challenge. So I need something that is budget friendly.\n\nAnyway, that's about it. I'd really appreciate some feedback since I feel kinda stuck!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/jwlscl/what_should_be_my_next_camera/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "i was introduced", "selectorShort": "introduce", "MarkedSent": "what should be my next camera? /!/ so -----> i !!!  -----> was !!!  -----> introduced !!!  to the world of photography about 2 years ago. i had a friend in college that happened to have a red nikon d3300 available, and that she offered to sell at a relatively cheap price. i had zero knowledge about cameras, lenses, brands, etc. so i agreed at the time because a friend of mine suggested that it wasn't that bad of a camera for beginner photograpers - now i know he had a canon with even lower specs than the camera i bought - so he convinced me to go for it since it would perform just fine for the work i was doing and because of the quality/price balance i was being offered. \n\nso now 2 years after, i've gotten to know my camera a whole lot better, the camera's sensor really kicks butt when used properly, those 24mpx can give me some crispy clear shots. so i've gotta say that my friend was right, the d3300 is way more than what meets the eye. i still have the kit lens and about a year ago i bought the 85mm f1.8 lens. my photography has improved a whole lot since (i do a bit of everything: street, architecture and portrait photography).\n\nso now that i'm a bit more experienced, i've also gotten to notice the faults the camera also possesses, for example:\n\u2022 while recording (or movie mode), the camera really struggles dealing with blacks and shadows, limiting my possibilities of recording in low light situations.\n\u2022 autofocus is laughable, constantly popping in and out and forcing me to simpler shots that can only be handled with manual focus.\n\u2022 lcd screen is fixed, also limiting the flexibility that some of the shots should have.\n\nso now that i'm not necessarily an amateur, i've really started to think about upgrading. i don't know if i should sell all my gear to switch brands, or if i should stick with nikon to keep the 85mm lens. the nikon z50 has been the apple of my eye as of recently, but it bothers me that the mount is different to the one i currently have for the 85. i've checked canon and fujifilm cameras but i've really grown a soft spot for nikon because of my buddy, the d3300.\n\nbottom line: i don't know what i should do next. the amount of cameras and specs still overwhelms me, so i need guidance, also, i live in a third world country (mexico), so saving money to buy/switch gear can be a bit of a challenge. so i need something that is budget friendly.\n\nanyway, that's about it. i'd really appreciate some feedback since i feel kinda stuck!", "sortedWord": "None", "Identifyer": null, "identifyer": 26128, "year": "2020"}], "name": "introducenikon2020"}
