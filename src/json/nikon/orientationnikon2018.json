I don't normally take pictures in portrait mode however even in landscape orientation I find the bracket useful.

Being a universal plate I found it easily came lose while the L bracket is extremely secure.  I don't know if I will be inspired to try and take more pictures in mode but I do think it is a great tripod accessory .
