I tried this forever and it didnt work but one day i turned my camera on and it worked fine. However just a few days ago i\u2019ve got the error again, and nothing i\u2019ve done has helped at all. I\u2019ve bought a new camera (nikon d 750) cause i\u2019m tired of an unreliable camera. I\u2019m interested in completely taking the d5200 apart and trying to fix the stuck shutter.
