I should emphasize that **focus breathing isn't a unique problem for the Tamron**. Pretty much every macro lens in existence will show the same behavior.\n\nBy my estimation, near focus just about doubles the effective focal length of the lens, making everything seem about twice as large as it would at \u221e focus.\n\nThis focus breathing can create some challenges for framing subjects. Very frequently I will over-estimate how close I need to be to the subject. When I acquire focus, I find myself re-framing, and then re-focusing. I'm sure it's something I'll adapt to with time, but it fairly noticeable as a new shooter.\n\nI find that manual focus is generally pretty easy through the viewfinder; the depth of field is so shallow that I really don't need the manual focus assist. It does however help to have subjects with a lot of depth so that I can see where my depth of field is.\n\nAutofocus generally works well, though it really benefits from having a lot of light when shooting at 1:1 reproduction ratios. I find that AF-C mode works best, but really wish I had a dedicated AF-On button on my camera (I use exposure lock extensively, so I'm not willing to re-map it.)\n\nI'm starting to think that a shorter macro lens would be a lot better for shooting flowers and small machines. Working distance doesn't suffer very much with a shorter lens, since the overall lens length subtracts from working distance.\n\n[Here are some sample images from the lens](https://imgur.com/a/ZL4p8).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/8btqm0/90mm_\u019228_macro_focus_breathing_demo/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "map", "selectorShort": "map", "MarkedSent": "90mm \u01922.8 macro focus breathing demo /!/ in my last post about the tamron 90mm \u01922.8 macro lens (original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nikon/comments/8b4z8j/initial_impressions_and_surprises_wtamron_90mm/)), there seemed to be some interesting discussion about focus breathing on macro lenses. \n\n[i put together a couple of quick shots that demonstrate how much this lens breaths in when focusing from \u221e to 1:1 magnification](https://imgur.com/a/u9ist). i should emphasize that **focus breathing isn't a unique problem for the tamron**. pretty much every macro lens in existence will show the same behavior.\n\nby my estimation, near focus just about doubles the effective focal length of the lens, making everything seem about twice as large as it would at \u221e focus.\n\nthis focus breathing can create some challenges for framing subjects. very frequently i will over-estimate how close i need to be to the subject. when i acquire focus, i find myself re-framing, and then re-focusing. i'm sure it's something i'll adapt to with time, but it fairly noticeable as a new shooter.\n\ni find that manual focus is generally pretty easy through the viewfinder; the depth of field is so shallow that i really don't need the manual focus assist. it does however help to have subjects with a lot of depth so that i can see where my depth of field is.\n\nautofocus generally works well, though it really benefits from having a lot of light when shooting at 1:1 reproduction ratios. i find that af-c mode works best, but really wish i had a dedicated af-on button on my camera (i use exposure lock extensively, so i'm not willing to re------> map !!!  it.)\n\ni'm starting to think that a shorter macro lens would be a lot better for shooting flowers and small machines. working distance doesn't suffer very much with a shorter lens, since the overall lens length subtracts from working distance.\n\n[here are some sample images from the lens](https://imgur.com/a/zl4p8).", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 43891, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 249588, "autor": "TFin04", "date": 1534195260000, "content": "Recommended 77mm filters? /!/ Getting ready to buy a few filters, at least a polarizing and ND, but maybe some color specific ones for shooting black and white.\n\nWondering what brand is a quality option?

I noticed during last time locking over the pictures, that there are 4 pictures (Nr 256, 266, 268 and 270) out of ~600 that show a symbol which might indenticate that the file is corrupted or something is wrong. I'm not sure so hopefully someone knows what this issue is.

I've also formatted the card in the computer since I've read that there might be broken sectores that will be written to the table to not be used anymore - which is kind of unlikely because the sd card is pretty new.
