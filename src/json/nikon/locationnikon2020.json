The source of the trouble was now as clear as day. The former owner (not necessarily the seller) had attempted to mend the cracked ring with superglue\u2014and had only managed to stick it fast to the barrel.

Excitedly, I began putting the beast back together.\n\nWhen I was nearly done reassembling the lens, something very bad happened.

The D500 does have a vertical grip mounted, adding to it's bulk. When hiking for the water falls or out landscaping, I seriouslly appreciated the Z's compact size. I left my 24-70/f2.8 at home over the lighter weight 24-85. I can only imagine donig these shots once I get my hands on the Z mount 24-70 f/4 and won't have the FTZ adapter bulking things up. \n\nThere were two reasons I brought the D500 with me. I had a planned visit to a small zoo and I would want the Tamron 150-600mm which doesn't AF on the Z 5+FTZ combo. There were hopes I would also find some wild deer or a black bear. I also got an opportunity to photograph the moon from a fairly dark sky location, so having it for those photos was good. True to form, the D500 sat unused for most of the trip.\n\nThe Z 5 worked quite very well, to the point I'm almost questioning the need to keep the D500 going forward.\n\nAs I've stated in previous posts, the Z 5 seems like a very suitable replacement for my former D750 except for the lack of a vertical grip and 2 fps (which is important for me). As such I will be sending the Z 5 back and ordering a Z 6II to use as my primary camera.\n\nBut here are a few things to know about the Z 5 (and I presume the entire Z family).\n\n**EVF:** I have a love-hate relationship with the EVF. It's really great to see your exposures. For my watefall shots, I knew that I wanted a 1 second exposure and f/8 or f/11 and I wanted to  keep the ISO low. With the variable ND filter and an optical viewfinder, you're guessing at the exposure. Take the photo, check the results, reshoot if you didn't get it right. The EVF let me dial the ND filter in just where I wanted it before I took the photo. You can zoom in to see your subject better. It creates a lot of flexibility. \n\nBut... it's pretty bright and sometimes it would give me the sensation that the shot was going to be blown out and I was frequently dialing in -EV. Maybe it's a bit too contrasty. I believe the images were okay and I didn't necessarily need to dial in that -0.3 or -0.7, but there were times where it was helpful.\n\nThe  other annoyance is shooting fast sequences for action shots or moving wildlife. At the zoo, when I was shooting short bursts, it was a little disorienting like stuttering slow-mo-video. I'm hoping with the faster frame rate on the Z 6II and less blackout it will help here. It's almost like it is showing the last shot briefly instead. It's weird. When shooting the animals at the zoo, the Optical view finder felt more natural. Maybe I need to use it more in these conditions.  \n\nI love focus peaking. I found myself doing more manual focus including using the Tamron on the Z 5. This is only possible with the EVF.\n\n**Battery Life**: The EN-EL15c basically could shoot all day. Driving back from some of our locations, I did have to pop in another battery while reviewing them. But oddly, the day the battery was drained the most, I only shot 152 stills and 13 video clips. But these were all long exposure waterfall shots. Many of them were in the 1-2 second range with a 2 second shutter delay and the 2 second ones kicked in long exposure noise reduction. I would keep the EVF or LCD awake while adjusting the neutral density filter, so I don't think it's a fair representation if you're just counting numbers of images. The next day I shot 438 images and one video clip and I had power to spare at the end of the day. I had a fair amount of review that day, For time lapse/astro work, I can see where USB power will be a helpful thing.\n\n**Card Speeds**: This is definetly not a camera related issue. I'm using a pair of 64GB UHS-I (95mb/s) cards in the Z 5, since that's what I had already. I have a 440mmb/s XQD card in the D500. The transfer times from cards to my MacBook Pro is quite noticiably different. UHS-II cards are more expensive, but I believe they are going to be worth the investment since they are 300mb/s. Still not as fast as the XQD cards. Since I'm considering the Z 6II, I'm wondering if I will be happy with my XQD cards or if I should get the 2-4 gb/s CFExspress cards, Still get the UHS-II cards for the SD slots.\n\n**Fun Stuff**: On my DSLRs, I pretty much just shot stills. I have a Pluto trigger which can do some fun things like it's laser trigger, but I've really not put it through it's paces. I had played with focus stacking before (doesn't work well handheld and breezy subjects), but I did my first time-lapse of moving clouds . I messed around with in camera HDR. And the whole video experience (flip a switch, press a button) was pretty good.\n\n**Handling**: I love this camera. Period. Full stop. That means I will love the Z 6II even more.\n\n**AF**: On my D750 and for the most part, the D500, I would put it on Dynamic 25 and AF-C and leave it there. You can certainly do that with the Z 5, but I do find myself switching between AF-C and AF-S more frequently. I'm switching between single point, dynamic and auto AF (where eye/face tracking lives) trying to find the best mode for the subject. I can't tell if  this is  a good thing or a bad thing. With the DSLRs, AF-C Dynamic 25 was good enough. I don't know if I'm just finding better ways to AF or if I'm just not trusting the AF to default to a standard settings. I feel like there may be more AF misses, but I can't rule out my error because I'm putzing with different settings. I get plenty of good photos, /shrug\n\n**MF**: As mentioned above, I love focus peaking. I was able to use the big Tamron on the Z 5 without AF. There were a fair amount of my backlight otters that the red contrast highlights made me think the face was in focus, just to find out that I missed a little bit. Zooming in may have helpted, but when you have the camera up to your face gettnig to the Zoom +/- buttons and dealing with a heavy lens is a bit of a challenge. I think it's time to just pony up the money and get the Nikon 200-500 and call it a day. Side note: Red focus peaking highlights on red flowers is useless. Change colors to yellow or blue :-)\n\n**Final thoughts**: This is a great camera. It's just not the right camera for me. I do want a functional vertical grip. I wan't the faster FPS. Based on the info in front of me, the Z 6II is the right camera for me. But if you don't need 12fps or don't want the option of the vertical grip (whcih will make the camera more bulky) the Z 5 is an excellent choice. I think it would be a solid backup camera for a wedding photographer, heck even a pair of them would be a solid wedding combo.  \n\nIt certainly has more than enough features that \"Entry level\" is an insult to this camera. \n\nIt's a full-frame, very well built and weather sealed camera that produces some excellent images. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone coming from the Dxxxx family of bodies wanting to go mirrorless and jump to full-frame. I would think anyone coming from D6xx and D7xx bodies would also be quite happy with this if the 4.5fps frame rate isn't a problem and you don't need the vertical grip. It's not quite going to make the D4/D5/D6/D500 user happy. The Z 9 may be that camera. D8xxx users will likely want a Z 7II.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/jj4ma9/more_nikon_z_5_observations_and_you_thought_i_was/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result":

the mountains chasing autumn colors, waterfalls, some landscapes, and a few other interesting subjects.\n\ni packed nearly my complete kit for the trip, which consisted of a z 5 + ftz adapter, d500, tokina 16-20 f/2.8, nikon 24-85 f/3.5-4.5 (primary lens for the trip), nikon 60mm f/2.8 macro (not sure how this snuck into the bag, didn't use it), nikon 105mm f/2.8 macro, nikon 70-200 f/2.8 vr ii, and my tamron 150-600mm f/5.0-6.3 along with a host of accessories like variable nd filter, step-down ring, cable releases, two tripods (heavy-duty, light travel), release plates for both, etc.\n\ni knew the z 5 was going to be my camera of choice for most everything. the d500 does have a vertical grip mounted, adding to it's bulk. when hiking for the water falls or out landscaping, i seriouslly appreciated the z's compact size. i left my 24-70/f2.8 at home over the lighter weight 24-85. i can only imagine donig these shots once i get my hands on the z mount 24-70 f/4 and won't have the ftz adapter bulking things up. \n\nthere were two reasons i brought the d500 with me. i had a planned visit to a small zoo and i would want the tamron 150-600mm which doesn't af on the z 5+ftz combo. there were hopes i would also find some wild deer or a black bear. i also got an opportunity to photograph the moon from a fairly dark sky -----> location !!! , so having it for those photos was good. true to form, the d500 sat unused for most of the trip.\n\nthe z 5 worked quite very well, to the point i'm almost questioning the need to keep the d500 going forward.\n\nas i've stated in previous posts, the z 5 seems like a very suitable replacement for my former d750 except for the lack of a vertical grip and 2 fps (which is important for me). as such i will be sending the z 5 back and ordering a z 6ii to use as my primary camera.\n\nbut here are a few things to know about the z 5 (and i presume the entire z family).\n\n**evf:** i have a love-hate relationship with the evf. it's really great to see your exposures. for my watefall shots, i knew that i wanted a 1 second exposure and f/8 or f/11 and i wanted to  keep the iso low. with the variable nd filter and an optical viewfinder, you're guessing at the exposure. take the photo, check the results, reshoot if you didn't get it right. the evf let me dial the nd filter in just where i wanted it before i took the photo. you can zoom in to see your subject better. it creates a lot of flexibility. \n\nbut... it's pretty bright and sometimes it would give me the sensation that the shot was going to be blown out and i was frequently dialing in -ev. maybe it's a bit too contrasty. i believe the images were okay and i didn't necessarily need to dial in that -0.3 or -0.7, but there were times where it was

I really didn't think about it. This wasn't something I was thinking about testing. That said, the F mount f/2.8 lens seemed to focus a little faster. I'm not likely to use any of  these of fast moving subjects, so it may be insignificant, but maybe I'll go back later and try to get a better feel for this.\n\nNext let's look at Depth of Field. Clearly the lenses at the same f-stop should have the same depth of field. But many people worry about getting that extra f-stop for a more defocused background. This subject is kinda close, so it might have a little more impact at futher distances, but DOF changes with closer subjects should show more variance. Naturally the f/2.8 has a shallower DOF to the f/4 shot. Is it significantly more pleasing? I can't answer that. Each of us put a different value on that. You will need to judge for yourself, if it's worth the cost difference in the lens or adding a fast prime to your bag is worth it.\n\nThere is a size/weight difference. The f/2.8 lens is already longer and has a larger front element and it's heavier. You have to add the FTZ length and weight to the equation. This impacts camera balance. When you factor this in vs. the depth of field gain, it can help you make that decision. For someone who wants to hike to remote locations, take the camera with you more often, etc. the Z lens would be the lens of choice. If you want that shallow depth of field, you're either going to accept the larger, heavier setup with the F mount lens or carry two lenses which ends up offsetting or being more weight to pack to get a 50 f/1.8 or f/1.4.\n\nFinally, to the main event... Sharpness. I'm not that photographer that's going to pixel peep this. As long as there isn't gross pin-cushion or barrel distortion or obvious CA, it's probably not going to be something I'm going to really worry about too much.\n\nObviouslly  I couldn't do a comparison a f/2.8, but I  don't see much of a difference either in the center or the edge between the lens at either f/4 or f/8.
