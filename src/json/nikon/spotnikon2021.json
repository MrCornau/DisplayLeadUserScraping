I've been doing photography for a little while now, and while I'm no stranger to sensor dust (green circle for reference), I haven't seen any smudges like this before. In my experience, dust on the rear element of my lens has always had more uniform borders, but these seem to be blotchy and widespread. The place where they are most visible is circled in red, but they seem to appear throughout the sky to some degree. They appear in the same spots between photos, and they're most noticeable when you increase the contrast/blacks in post. Also, the Z6 was my first full frame, so I've tested other lenses, but they're crop lenses using an adapter for the new mount, so I'm not sure how reliable of a comparison it is.

Anyone else? /!/ Pro photographer here. I shoot mostly weddings and portraits. Coming off three D750 DSLRs, I recently dove headfirst into the Nikon Z system with the purchase of two Z6II bodies, plus the Z 70-200 f/2.8 S, the Z 24-70 f/4 S, the Z 24-70 f/2.8s, the Z 24-200 f/4-5.6, the Z 50mm f/1.8, and the Z-mount Meike 85mm f/2.8 MF macro.\n\nI'm almost three weeks in and while I've come home from photo jobs with great images every time \u2014 exemplary sharpness and nice vibrant colors! \u2014 I've had issues too.\n\n1. My cameras tend to overexpose to the point of clipping when *a part* of my photos is taken up by a white building in the sun. At first I thought it was my fault \u2014 maybe I'd accidentally used exposure compensation, or spot metering rather than matrix, and so on. The next time I went back to the same scene I was very careful to watch my settings, and I set exposure compensation to two-thirds of a stop *under*, with the camera in matrix metering for sure. Still came home with the white building *way* overexposed, almost clipping. Had the same problem yesterday, but less pronounced, when I shot group photos that included someone wearing white pants. The pants were over-exposed by two or three stops. Never had that issue with any of my DSLRs. \n2. The shutter on one of my Z6II cameras locked up soon after I began using it. The display read *ERR* and a message said to press the shutter again. I did and nothing happened. Turned the camera off, then on again, still the same message but this time pressing the shutter button worked and everything went back to normal. Hmm.\n3. Two days ago I came home from a job with a whole bunch of NEF files *missing* from the main card, maybe 200 files (!) total. No reason that I can think of. I had to use my backup JPEGs to be able to deliver the job. Thank the heavens for that double card slot. I would've been hosed if I'd used a Z6.\n4. Could be operator error, but I've found repeatedly that when I photograph a group in AF-C and with wide-area people eye detect on (but tracking not engaged), the small yellow box will find an eye (which is good)...but I can't reliably move the eye box. There may be someone standing next to the person the focus is on, and frustratingly there's no little solid yellow triangle that indicates I can move the focus there with the thumb joystick. Sometimes that little yellow triangle only appears to the *other* side of the person the camera focuses on, even if that's not the direction where I want to move the focus point.\n\nAnyone else?
