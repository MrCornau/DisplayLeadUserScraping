It's almost always the photographer, not the gear.\n\nI went out to our big lake yesterday, well more specifically, the river below the dam eagle hunting. Eagles can be found there frequently, but they are still a hard find other than getting one in a remote tree. My last trip out a few weeks ago was \"Great Blue Heron Day\", with over 30 chilling on the far bank and usually a couple in the air fishing. The Osprey traffic has been increasing as well based on other photographers who frequent the location. The spot is popular. There were 7-8 other photographers there yesterday.\n\nIt was Osprey day. There were at times four buzzing around the spillway, occasionally making the Osprey dive and always coming up with a fish. It's amazing how they can precisely nail a fish in very muddy water from a few hundred feet up in the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Osprey after grabbing a fish. 1\\/800 f\\/8 200-500+TC14e 700mm considerable crop ISO 250](https://preview.redd.it/ubt5mkafd7r61.jpg?width=2038&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3ad7963768c68c491afb5328fabca882e9b6c28)\n\nI decided the only gear I would pack for the day would be my Z  6II, my Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6, and my Nikon TC14E III (1.4x TC).\n\nI usually do a pretty good job capturing birds in flight with this equipment. Wide area AF works pretty well. The lens focuses fast enough (could be better). The TC-14E doesn't seem to slow things down much.\n\nIn 677 photos, I pitched 122 of them for being obviously out of focus, most of the bird out of the frame, accidents, birds flying behind trees... you know the junk. I would guess 100 of them were clearly out of focus. That's about an 85% hit rate, which I guess isn't that bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Osprey in flight.

Perhaps some were the TC. Many of them show the red focus blocks not on the bird. And this is where my frustration started. The camera really seemed to want to lock on to background elements, rocks, trees, etc. Of course, a small bird against contrasty trees and rocks is going to frustrate any AF system. My lasts trip was a foggy, gray, overcast day. Yesterday was bright and sunny and lots of contrast. I tried different combinations of focus modes. I tried focus tracking, but trying to handhold that beast of a lens and activate focus tracking while the bird is a real challenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Juvenile Red-tail Hawk - 1\\/800 f\\/5.6 ISO 200 @ 500mm](https://preview.redd.it/enkucl07e7r61.jpg?width=1927&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc4ec58b7f601cd1f8ee350e01b070b10d46e427)\n\nTo make matters worse, many of the birds were pretty much above me. Trying to shoot that combination with the lens pointing straight up really stressed out my left arm. Many of my \"out of frame\" shots were with the bird more overhead.\n\nI had a significant amount of motion blur too. Even with VR in the lens, IBIS in the body and Auto ISO on giving me a handholdable shutter speed, they were just bad.\n\nWith the lighting, it was a challenge to see the LCD on the back. I ended up making most of my adjustments from the EVF. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Great Blue Heron in flight, f\\/8 1\\/800 ISO 220, 700mm](https://preview.redd.it/0n7csdpqg7r61.jpg?width=2553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e26a0a2ca673c887b3abb268d6c563f4af91df)\n\nIt was disappointing.\n\nWhere the gear failed me: \n\n* Weight\n* AF Speed\n\nBut in retrospect, most of the problem is was behind the camera. \n\nWhere I failed me:\n\n* Depending on auto ISO. Had I just set the ISO up to something reasonable like ISO 800 which the camera can easily do, I would have had higher shutter speeds. Auto ISO doesn't want to give me much more than one stop more than 1/focal length.\n* Trying to shoot things over my head where I don't have the upper body strenght to do so. You have to bend over backwards which creates an unbalanced platform.\n* Not enough expereience trying to pan with that lens. Maybe if I had a gimble head and a steady tripod I might be better, or use a monopod. The monopod doesn't provide any vertical flexibility though and the gimble head only gives you some vertical access without you having to squat.\n* I can't move the camera well enough to make subject tracking work.\n* Panning while trying to fill the frame is a challenge.\n\nI wonder if the 500mm f/5.6 PF lens, being almost 2 pounds lighter and I suspect faster AF would make my life better? It's only 3 ounces heavier than the 70-200 f/2.8... Maybe I should get this instead of replacing my 70-200 f/2.8 F mount. I shoot a lot of stuff at 500mm.\n\nOn a good note, the 677 photos consumed two pips of battery. Since the last charge, I've shot 780 photos and have 37% left. That works out to about 1200 shots on a charge.\n\nDo I hate my Z 6II? Absolutly not. I love the camera. Do I hate the 200-500 f/5.6. It's sharp and produces some really good images, but it's a beast.
