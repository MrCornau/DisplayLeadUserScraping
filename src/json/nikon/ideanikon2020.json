The Best Buy near me only has 3000 and 5000 series Nikon DSLR's out to play with but found out the store 12 miles away has literally all the major cameras from Nikon, Canon, Sony  and some Panasonic cameras out.\n\nI currently have a D500 and though it is a great camera I was intrigued by some of the features mirrorless brings...stabilization, great video, smaller size, etc. All that pus a full frame sensor!!\n\nI wasnt disappointed. The camera feels great, the size is really perfect for my hand, being a glasses wearer the evf blew me away. Large, bright, not anywhere near the lag I remember from checking out mirrorless from a few years ago. \n\nAlso really liked the 24-70 f4. I think it will be a great all purpose lens.\n\nHave been searching all the usual sites trying to put together the best value for me dollar for the camera, lens and FTZ adapter...not sure if I am going to grab some or all of the pieces new or used. I bought my D500 from a seller in Japan and it was perfect...same seller has all 3 pieces I want for a great price used on ebay.\n\nDecisions decisions.
