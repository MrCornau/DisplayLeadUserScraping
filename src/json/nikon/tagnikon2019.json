Some people have had wonderful experiences with a piece of equipment, and others have had less wonderful experiences.\n* **DO YOUR RESEARCH!** I can't emphasize this enough. Understand the difference between DX (APS-C) and FX (35mm). Understand WHY you need a FX body or why you don't. Understand what an AA filter is. Understand what digital noise is. Understand what AF-S vs AF-P is. Understand what f-stops are. If you see something on a spec sheet that you don't know about, look it up. It's called Google. In the end, we're not buying the equipment: you are. You should know what you're buying, rather than blindly buying whatever we tell you to buy.\n* **Use your question as a reference, not a magic bullet**. We'll make recommendations based on what we think you need. You should always confer with other reviews, double check spec sheets, and fact check what we say. We're people, and sometimes we get stuff wrong, too.\n* **Equipment isn't magical**. Equipment won't make you any better of a photographer. It's a tool, and you need to know how to use it.\n* **Remember that equipment has a price tag**, and that there's just no way that you can get a camera with 12FPS drive with 45 MP resolution that has a buffer of 200 images for $500. Likewise, you shouldn't overpay (this goes back to doing your research). Do a cost-benefit analysis. If that extra 3 FPS is really worth $400, then of course, you should spend that money. If it's not, then take that money and spend it elsewhere that matters. If you really need all of those features, then prepare to cough up the dough to match. If you don't, then don't spend the money for that stuff.\n* **What's your price range?** The more specific the range, the better.\n* **What do you plan on doing with it?** Do you want to convert it to infrared? Do you want to do sports or landscapes? Or both? Let us know so we can match you with the best gear for you.\n* **What's your skill level?** Are you a semipro or a total beginner? Rank your skill level on a scale from 1 to 10. It'll help others decide what's a good body or lens for your skill level.\n* **What equipment are you coming from, if any?** Do you need to match it with anything (i.e. a body with a lens or a lens with a body)?\n* **Beware the marketing BS!** If you see something in a marketing overview that smells fishy, ask us! Some of us have pretty good BS detectors.\n\nI said it before, and I'll say it again. **We're not buying the equipment: you are.** Do your due diligence, and if someone says something that you're not sure about, feel free to ask them about why they chose that particular item!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/agdy76/looking_for_a_new_body_or_lens/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "nikon", "result": true, "Selector": "tag", "selectorShort": "tag", "MarkedSent": "looking for a new body or lens? /!/ here's some tips and info that will help the very helpful nikon community give you good recommendations.\n\n* **remember that everyone shares their opinion**. some people have had wonderful experiences with a piece of equipment, and others have had less wonderful experiences.\n* **do your research!** i can't emphasize this enough. understand the difference between dx (aps-c) and fx (35mm). understand why you need a fx body or why you don't. understand what an aa filter is. understand what digital noise is. understand what af-s vs af-p is. understand what f-stops are. if you see something on a spec sheet that you don't know about, look it up. it's called google. in the end, we're not buying the equipment: you are. you should know what you're buying, rather than blindly buying whatever we tell you to buy.\n* **use your question as a reference, not a magic bullet**. we'll make recommendations based on what we think you need. you should always confer with other reviews, double check spec sheets, and fact check what we say. we're people, and sometimes we get stuff wrong, too.\n* **equipment isn't magical**. equipment won't make you any better of a photographer. it's a tool, and you need to know how to use it.\n* **remember that equipment has a price -----> tag !!! **, and that there's just no way that you can get a camera with 12fps drive with 45 mp resolution that has a buffer of 200 images for $500. likewise, you shouldn't overpay (this goes back to doing your research). do a cost-benefit analysis. if that extra 3 fps is really worth $400, then of course, you should spend that money. if it's not, then take that money and spend it elsewhere that matters. if you really need all of those features, then prepare to cough up the dough to match. if you don't, then don't spend the money for that stuff.\n* **what's your price range?** the more specific the range, the better.\n* **what do you plan on doing with it?** do you want to convert it to infrared? do you want to do sports or landscapes? or both? let us know so we can match you with the best gear for you.\n* **what's your skill level?** are you a semipro or a total beginner? rank your skill level on a scale from 1 to 10. it'll help others decide what's a good body or lens for your skill level.\n* **what equipment are you coming from, if any?** do you need to match it with anything (i.e. a body with a lens or a lens with a body)?\n* **beware the marketing bs!** if you see something in a marketing overview that smells fishy, ask us! some of us have pretty good bs detectors.\n\ni said it before, and i'll say it again. **we're not buying the equipment: you are.** do your due diligence, and if someone says something that you're not sure about, feel free to ask them about why they chose that particular item!", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 1280, "year": "2019"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1473, "autor": "thegoatwrote", "date": 1549631720000, "content": "Question about DIY minor repair on Nikon 105mm Micro f/2.8 AF Lens /!/ I have a Nikon 105mm f/2.8 AF MICRO-NIKKOR lens, and I bought it used with broken autofocus. It takes beautiful photos, but in addition to the lack of AF, the lens doesn't tell the body what its focal length is, so I have to set and use the non-CPU lens settings to get the EXIF tags populated and what not. Also, sadly, once in a while, I can't set the aperture using the body's wheel, and I have to un-mount/re-mount the lens to get it to work on any other f-stop. The LCD just displays f/13 or whatever I had it set on last and will not change when I spin the wheel. So the electronics in the lens are fried. But in months of ownership and fairly frequent use, that's only happened twice, and it's pretty easily \"fixed\". I got the lens pretty cheap and really only use it for macro, so I don't have a _big_ problem with this.\n\nI'm pretty sure I can pop the dandelion off the lens, cut and/or file any bits of conductor I see left sticking out from the lens body and attach one of the inexpensive \"dandelion chips\" off of eBay for $25 or so and have this fixed, or at least working as a MF lens that identifies itself to the body.
