I have yet to clean my sensor and am rather apprehensive about doing so! @howiebrou, This is not official sensor cleaning doctrine from anyone or from any manufacturer; it is just the method I use and is based on sensor cleaning instructions found in the M-P 240 manual and the instructions that come with the swabs and cleaning fluid I use. I have had 100% positive results with 0% problems as a result of using this cleaning technique. I seem to need to clean my sensor about once every 6-9 months. I clean my sensor when multiple dust specks show up in post processing that require an annoying amount of time and work to clone over, not every time a spot or two turns up in post. This description is from a blog post that I wrote for my website; I hope this will shed some light on the sensor cleaning process (we are actually cleaning the protective glass cover, not the sensor itself) for you and others. Quote Digital cameras have sensors; unless your camera has a built in dust reduction system, sooner or later your sensor will need to be cleaned - it's inevitable. Then what?? It's a lot quicker, easier and less costly to do it yourself - if you follow your camera manual instructions exactly and are careful, you can successfully clean your camera's sensor yourself. A lot of photographers fear damaging their sensor and will do about anything to avoid cleaning it themselves. However, there is no reason to be afraid to do this procedure yourself, provided you do it properly. You will need the right sensor cleaning supplies - I use Eclipse Optic Cleaning Fluid and Photosol Sensorswab Ultra sensor cleaning swabs. If your camera has a full frame (24x36mm ) sensor, you will need the Type 3 swabs; they are 24 mm wide, as is your sensor. APS-C and smaller sensors will need smaller swabs. Photosol's website has information that will help you determine which swab is right for your camera. One of the most important factors in successful sensor cleaning is to perform this procedure in a clean, dust free environment. Not many of us have access to a clean room such as computer manufacturers build computers in. If your home has airborne dust issues you will need to clean your sensor in an environment where dust is less of a problem (you can check for airborne dust by looking through the beam of a bright flashlight at night; if you see a lot of dust particles dancing in the air, you should probably go elsewhere to clean your sensor). Where would that be? Try a museum or a library; -----> find a spot !!!  away from frequent foot traffic, entries and exits and away from heating and cooling ducts that will cause airflow that will stir up any dust that may be present.. Another important point is this - do not use compressed air (\"canned air\") to blow dust from your sensor before cleaning. Canned air can spray liquid propellant onto your sensor cover glass, something you do not want to happen. That liquid can also get behind the sensor and into the electronic components of your camera. If that happens, you are in for a serious repair bill. Instead of canned air, use a blower bulb like the Giottos Rocket Blaster, which will safely remove loose dust particles from your sensor. Also, do not blow dust from your sensor using your breath, as you can spray tiny droplets of saliva into the camera. The sensor swabs I use are dry, which means I need to apply the proper cleaning fluid to them before use. Too much cleaning fluid can damage the electronics inside your camera, so proceed with caution. I have found that five drops on the 24mm wide swabs my camera requires is sufficient (three drops on one side, two on the opposite side, equally spaced across the width of the swab); I would be comfortable using two drops per side, but no more than five drops for a 24 mm wide swab. Again, follow the directions that come with your swabs and cleaning fluid to the letter. Each camera has a specific procedure for sensor cleaning; if you precisely adhere to the instructions in your camera manual, you should have a successful sensor cleaning result. If there are still spots on your sensor after cleaning, you can re-clean the sensor provided your camera manual does not advise against doing so (I once ended up with an eyelash on my sensor that required two cleanings to remove; the first try simply moved it closer to the center of the sensor; this happens sometimes). If you follow the directions in your camera manual and in your swab and cleaning fluid to the letter, you should have no problems cleaning your sensor at home (or at your local museum or library, if need be). DISCLAIMER 1: The above description of sensor cleaning is simply a description of how I clean my sensor; it is not intended as training or professional advice in sensor cleaning. 2: Always follow the directions in your camera manual and in your sensor cleaning materials to the letter. When in doubt, contact your camera manufacturer for advice on sensor cleaning, or return your camera to the manufacturer's repair department for sensor cleaning. 3: The author accepts no responsibility for damage of any kind resulting from do it yourself sensor cleaning. When in doubt, contact your camera manufacturer to return your camera to the manufacturer's repair department for professional sensor cleaning.

The trick is to keep ISO low or there will plenty of noise and to pull the shadows up in post-processing. This translates to being able to shoot at higher shutter speeds in low light conditions to counter camera shake and have usable pictures; they won't look much on the M8's LCD but will emerge during post. Pete. Thank you for explaining something I was puzzled about. In the sunset photo I just posted, I thought the building at the right was just \"black\". When playing around with the sliders during processing, I noticed I could bring up all the details. Even the buildings in downtown Miami could have the details shown in the photo. To me, having everything \"black\" is what I envisioned as I took the photo, and was working with it, but I couldn't resist showing some of the details in the side of the building. Next time I try this photo (it's right outside my window, so I can photograph it ever day if I wish) I want to try the exposure-lock \"trick\". I never knew the camera even had exposure lock until I started reading the manual again on a whim.

While being in the spot removal tool hit \"T\" which will display a tool bar at the bottom where you have another nifty tool to display an inverted contrasty mask which can be adjusted with a slider. This makes finding certain \"hidden\" dust spots very easy. You can do your dust spotting in one of your photographs that makes this very easy (a blank wall, shot at f16 or the bright sky) and then copy over the dust spotting information from one photograph to a bulk of photographs. Easy: select all photographs, you want to apply the dust spotting information in the library grid view (or in any module that shows you the film roll at the bottom of the screen). Make sure the one photo which does have your dust spotting already applied is the selected photo of the entire bulk. Now go to the development module (hit \"D\" on your keyboard) and click the \"sync\" button in your development tool ribbon on the very bottom right of the screen (it is the left button of the two buttons). A pop up menu will be displayed where you can select what settings from your selected master photo you wish to sync - you want to select only the dust spotting option, if that is what you want to apply to all selected photographs in the group from your master photograph in focus. After applying, let Lightroom calculate new 1:1 previews of the group of photos and quickly check them all if any of the dust spots have ill effects (easiest to do in the development module, while pressing activating \"Q\" and deactivating \"Q\" as necessary to see the dust spots) Easy photographs are those of dust in the sky - Lightroom will often simply correct them easily. More difficult ones are those with irregular structures (hair, grass, etc \u2026) or regular structures with repeating patterns (like a panning shot at very slow shutter speeds or architecture shots) - Lightroom will often not properly realize the patterns and will place a wrong correction which is easily spotted and has to be adjusted manually. Best practice is to clean the sensor once Lightroom dust spotting becomes to tedious. BTW - if you run also Adobe Photoshop and work with tiff files, a faster way to dust spot is to use a selection tool (I prefer the free form selection tool), multi select all dust spots in an area and then \"shift +F5\" and use the \"fill content-aware\" option to remove dust spots. This is how I spot my film scans for dust, water spots and scratches and it is both much, much faster than Lightroom's spotting tool and does not slow the computer down as much as a photograph with lots of dust spots in Lightroom (as it is not non-destructive as Lightroom, but will correct the image per pixel immediately). Happy dust spotting!
