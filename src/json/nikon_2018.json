I've been using my D3100 for a couple of years now, but lately I am thinking about upgrading. Mostly because I'm improving my photography skills and I feel the D3100 is not enough anymore (especially in difficult low light situations). My main focus is on nature and wildlife photography. Yet i also like portraits, city and night photography. I've only got the kit lenses that came with the D3100 and one additional Tamron 18-400 lens.\nMy main question is if you would recommend the 7200 or the 7500? My preference goes out to the 7200, yet it is an older model (2015). Would you recommend going for the newer model or do you think the 7200 will be sufficient enough (in terms of tech and performance) for a couple of more years or do you think more like 'its gonna be outdated soon and you should wait for the next one'.
