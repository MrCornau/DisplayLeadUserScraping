My hostess were getting eaten, my shrubs demolished, and generally I\u2019ve been having a bad time with rabbits.\n\nI looked into a number of options, and tried a few - scattering blood meal, over the counter sprays, etc.\n\nThere are a few formulations that work. I wanted to share the one I use. I wanted something non-toxic that would last a while.\n\nSo first buy denatonium benzoate off eBay - this is non toxic and harmless, but extremely bitter. Legendary bitter. It is the most bitter substance on earth. A few grams will do it.\n\nNext buy a spreader sticker from a garden store. A few ounces will do it.\n\nNow (outside) mix up a gallon of water, a tablespoon or so of sticker, and a gram of denatonium (more or less) in a garden sprayer (which is all you\u2019ll use this sprayer for from now on). Wear a mask (which we all have) and garden gloves because any denatonium powder on your face or hands will be harmless but not fun.\n\nNow spray it on your ornamentals. Do not spray it on anything you will eat because it will ruin the taste.\n\nThe sticker will make the denatonium cling to your plants and any animal that tries to eat it will be repelled by the taste and not return. It works, and it lasts. No smell, easy to apply, not toxic, works like a charm. Reapply on new growth.
