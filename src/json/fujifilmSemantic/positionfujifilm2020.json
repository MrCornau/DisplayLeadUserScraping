I set up a sharpness  test in my  backyard with a stool 3 metres away from with a box on it,  in front of a  hedge. I then positioned my camera on my sturdy tripod  and took two  shots at f8 and f11 (I am a landscape photographer so  these are most  important apetures typically) at ISO200, 1/125th of a  second shutter  speed. I focused on the box on the stool and I dont  think the quality is  very good when I zoom into 100% and worse at 200%.
