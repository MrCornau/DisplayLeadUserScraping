I'm a beginner photographer transitioning from my Google Pixel 3 to my first camera. I'm mainly looking to shoot my family for documenting memories, some portraits, and maybe a casual bit of nature/landscape photography sprinkled in. I'm really excited about Fuji due to mainly its JPEG potential with film simulations and its overall colours. With that said, I have been absolutely blown away by the images I've seen online from the X100V but am having a hard time swallowing its price tag. I've been looking for a good used deal online but in the meantime wanted opinions on whether the X-ES (with the 27mm pancake lens) would be comparable to the image quality of the X100V. I know they are different X-Trans sensors, different lens max aperture and size (but I want the compact form factor of the X100V so I take the camera with me everywhere). I've also looked into the X-T30 and that is super attractive to (alongside the same X-Trans sensor as the X100V) but is in the same price range as the X100V. I don't mind having one single lens for a while as long as it gets the job done for my needs and produces fantastic images (preferably JPEGS as I don't have much experience with editing RAW yet). Moreover, I do love the Classic Negative film simulation in the X100V but I think I can live without it with the price difference in the X-E3.
