I just wanted to share my experience with everyone here, as it may answer some questions that have been asked previously.\n\n**Locations travelled:**\n\n* Ranua, North Finland\n* Helsinki, Finland\n* Stockholm, Sweden\n* Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n**Info about myself:**\n\n* hobbyist shooter, mostly street\n* recently switched to X-T2 from Canon 5D2 last fall\n\n**My gear (**I only travelled with a backpack for this trip)\n\n* X-T2, 23mm f1.4, 56mm f1.2, Manfrotto Pixi Evo Mini tripod\n* I used a hiking/travel backpack and bought some camera inserts for my gear (not spending $300 CAD on a camera backpack that can only carry camera gear) - this combo allowed me to also pack clothes and a surface book\n\n**Thoughts on Weight:**\n\nSince switching from my heavy Canon 5D mk2, the reduced weight of the X-T2 made it so easy to carry all day long. Sure, with the 56mm attached, it can get heavy towards the end of a long day, but overall still 50% lighter than what I had before and it made me keep the camera out at all times.\n\n**Weather Sealing:**\n\n**Cold Weather:** This is a common question I've seen from users. Ranua is around -25C to -30C, and at times I was out there for at least 3-4 hours in the cold. I've read up on how to protect my camera before I left for the trip and was recommended to keep camera ziplock bag when entering inside a warmer climate from outside. I never actually used my ziplock bags. I was slightly worried since both my lens don't have WR, but really this isn't an issue. My camera functioned perfectly fine in the super cold weather, and when I went inside where there was heating, I would just place it in my backpack. \n\n**Rain:** When it rained in Copenhagen, I would try not to expose the camera too much and place under my jacket. There would be droplets on the camera and lens occasionally but it didn't bother it much and functioned fine. \n\n**Choice of Lens:**\n\nI definitely used the 23mm 90% or more most of the time. There were times I wished I had a wider lens when taking pictures of buildings, the 16mm would have worked better to capture the entire building, but overall I am very happy with the 23mm as it is a pretty versatile lens. The 56mm I used for the zoo for it's longer focal length and used it at some other parts of the trip as well when I needed the slightly extra reach. \n\n**Battery:** I had 2 batteries, and I would usually turn off the camera if not in use to converse battery. In the cold, it definitely drained pretty fast - I kept a spare in my pocket to keep it warm. I'm a somewhat conservative shooter, so 2 batteries worked well for me.\n\n**Highlights of my trip:**\n\n**Northern Lights:** got super lucky ...we saw it 2x!! I managed to even capture a video of it too while we were driving. I managed to got a few 'okay' photos of it from where I was staying.\n\n**Ranua:** Beautiful winter area - everything was snow and ice, it felt so eerie but magical at same time. We also visited Ranua Zoo and fed Artic Fox and saw Polar Bears feed.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/an5p0s/rare\\_arctic\\_fox\\_north\\_finland\\_at\\_ranua\\_zoo\\_xt2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/an5p0s/rare_arctic_fox_north_finland_at_ranua_zoo_xt2/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/amt73m/about\\_to\\_feed\\_polar\\_bears\\_in\\_finland\\_ranua\\_zoo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/amt73m/about_to_feed_polar_bears_in_finland_ranua_zoo/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/am3s4m/start\\_of\\_vacation\\_arctic\\_fox\\_igloo\\_reception\\_xt2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/am3s4m/start_of_vacation_arctic_fox_igloo_reception_xt2/)\n\nI have to sort through my photos, more of my stuff can be found on my IG: @yummyhawtsauce \n\nI love Fuji and I am very happy with my switch.
