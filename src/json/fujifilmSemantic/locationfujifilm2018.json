Currently, my bag usually contains a D610, a 35 f/1.8 (this lens is on the camera about 80% of the time), a 70-300VR, and a Tokina 16-28 f/2.8. It does everything I need, but after hiking a couple miles up a steep hill with that bag I'm about ready to throw it into a river. Now that tax returns are coming, I'm looking to make the jump and save my future self some back pain. Below is what I'm looking at to fill the roles of my current gear with something smaller and lighter, but I still have some questions and am open to other suggestions.\n\nBody: X-Pro2 - Pretty firm on this choice. Part practicality and part taste, I need an optical viewfinder. This is the reason I didn't jump to mirrorless cameras years ago. The EVFs are fantastic, and for most usage scenarios I have no problem using them exclusively. However, when it comes to shooting in a pitch black location in the middle of the night, it's nearly impossible to compose a shot with an EVF that is only resolving a handful of point sources from the brightest stars. I also just prefer seeing things optically, and especially with the histogram overlay in the X100S I find myself using the OVF in most cases.\n\nWide Angle: Samyang 12mm F2 or 10mm F2.8 - Here's a spot where I'm looking for some input. The wider angle of the 10 is appealing, but so is the faster optics and lighter weight of the 12. I'm currently leaning toward the 12, but I'm curious what others think. Manual focus is fine, this lens will be used mostly at night when autofocus stops being useful anyway. I was considering the Fuji 10-24 for a while, but its coma and lower speed along with higher cost made it less appealing.\n\nGeneral purpose: Fuji XF23mm f/2 - This would fill the role of my 35 f1.8, which is the lens I use the vast majority of the time anyway. I've also been eyeing the larger f1.4 version and am not opposed to saving a bit more if it's worth it, but as a lens that'll be going everywhere with me I think that the weather resistance will come in the more useful than the extra speed.\n\nTelephoto: Fuji XF55-200 or XC50-230 - Another spot where I'm having trouble deciding. For those of you who have tried them, is the aperture ring and build quality of the XF worth the drastic cost increase? This lens would get the least use of the three, but I don't want to give up on image quality if I'm already springing for an X-Pro2. Thoughts on this one? \n\n\nI'm open to suggestions on any of these. I think I've done enough research to have a good idea of what I'm getting into, but as with any big purchase I'd like to get a second opinion from those with experience before pulling the trigger.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/80cgfd/nikon_convert_looking_for_suggestions/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "fujifilm", "result": true, "Selector": "location", "selectorShort": "location", "MarkedSent": "nikon convert looking for suggestions /!/ i've shot nikon for 10 years, but after buying a used x100s a while back and not shooting my d610 at all since then, i'm now looking to jump into the fuji system and begin selling my nikon gear.\n\nsome background: i primarily shoot landscapes and wide field astrophotography, with some street photography and casual portraits thrown in here and there. currently, my bag usually contains a d610, a 35 f/1.8 (this lens is on the camera about 80% of the time), a 70-300vr, and a tokina 16-28 f/2.8. it does everything i need, but after hiking a couple miles up a steep hill with that bag i'm about ready to throw it into a river. now that tax returns are coming, i'm looking to make the jump and save my future self some back pain. below is what i'm looking at to fill the roles of my current gear with something smaller and lighter, but i still have some questions and am open to other suggestions.\n\nbody: x-pro2 - pretty firm on this choice. part practicality and part taste, i need an optical viewfinder. this is the reason i didn't jump to mirrorless cameras years ago. the evfs are fantastic, and for most usage scenarios i have no problem using them exclusively. however, when it comes to shooting in a pitch black -----> location !!!  in the middle of the night, it's nearly impossible to compose a shot with an evf that is only resolving a handful of point sources from the brightest stars. i also just prefer seeing things optically, and especially with the histogram overlay in the x100s i find myself using the ovf in most cases.\n\nwide angle: samyang 12mm f2 or 10mm f2.8 - here's a spot where i'm looking for some input. the wider angle of the 10 is appealing, but so is the faster optics and lighter weight of the 12. i'm currently leaning toward the 12, but i'm curious what others think. manual focus is fine, this lens will be used mostly at night when autofocus stops being useful anyway. i was considering the fuji 10-24 for a while, but its coma and lower speed along with higher cost made it less appealing.\n\ngeneral purpose: fuji xf23mm f/2 - this would fill the role of my 35 f1.8, which is the lens i use the vast majority of the time anyway. i've also been eyeing the larger f1.4 version and am not opposed to saving a bit more if it's worth it, but as a lens that'll be going everywhere with me i think that the weather resistance will come in the more useful than the extra speed.\n\ntelephoto: fuji xf55-200 or xc50-230 - another spot where i'm having trouble deciding. for those of you who have tried them, is the aperture ring and build quality of the xf worth the drastic cost increase? this lens would get the least use of the three, but i don't want to give up on image quality if i'm already springing for an x-pro2. thoughts on this one? \n\n\ni'm open to suggestions on any of these. i think i've done enough research to have a good idea of what i'm getting into, but as with any big purchase i'd like to get a second opinion from those with experience before pulling the trigger.", "sortedWord": "None", "identifyer": 262, "year": "2018"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 206854, "autor": "BNoog", "date": 1515292997000, "content": "Good price to buy an XPRO1 and location? /!/ I heard that they can be found in ex condition for under $400 but I have yet to find any besides sketchbay.
