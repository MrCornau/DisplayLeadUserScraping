Can you please give some advice regarding possible alternatives? /!/ **TLDR: I went to a photography store and tried out multiple cameras. Ended up liking Fujifilm T3 and T4 the most. Now I'm looking to get some feedback from whoever is willing to drop a few lines :)** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHello! \n\n\n\nI used to study art, with focus on painting, drawing, composition, art history, design history, graphics design (corel, photoshop, macromedia flash rip). After that I worked as a designer for years (mostly graphics design). Did some photography (camera provided by employer) when needed but never had any formal photography training. I have never owned my personal camera. As a hobby I've taken photos with all of my phones (from dumbphones to smartphones, current phone is Google Pixel 5). My phone \"photography\" experience started around 2008. I've used most of the known android camera applications (Google Camera, Modified versions of google camera, filmic pro, open camera and many more); to expand on my phone camera capabilities I've used my own experimental \"lenses\", such as taking photographs through looking glasses, binoculars, eyeglasses, regular glasses, tinted glass, reflections from surfaces, through multiple surfaces, through containers filled with water etc. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter leaving the design industry I've continued to draw, craft and have taken photos with my smartphone. Since I've hit the technical limitations on my phone cameras for far too long and haven't found workarounds, I have realized that it's better to just get a dedicated camera as a tool to realize my artistic visions, capture scenes and moments as an artistic expression for myself and for my family and close friends. Most common photo scenarios: nature (flora, fauna, especially birds, insects), cats, people, some sort of astro photography capability would be a godsend, architecture, rivers, bunkers.\n\nGoogle Pixel 5 isn't giving me enough control over pretty much all settings (I posted the limitations to my previous thread, but just in case, I'll add them to the end of my post). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyhow after the suggestions I got on reddit I did much more research - found out that I really like how Fujifilm camera colors look pre-editing, the multiple physical controls on the camera. Earlier today I went to a photography shop and tried different cameras (held them in hand, how they fit, how the buttons feels etc). \n\nOut of the ones I tested (and considered to fit my needs) Canon m50 mk 2 was okay (it didn't feel that good to be honest) but I loved Fujifilm t3 and t4. Those seemed to fit my hand size perfectly. I also really enjoy physical controls on the camera. As a bonus my partner also liked Fujifilm cameras the most, so that is a plus. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo with that wall of text aside.\n\nMy plan is to stick with this camera for years. This could be a very wrong approach when it comes to photography, so please correct me if I'm wrong: I usually prefer to buy a single high quality tool and use it for a long time, until it breaks and/or I reach a technical limitation (less bought products = smaller carbon footprint and so on). I also want to invest in a few lenses after buying the camera &amp; keep expanding the lens selection as the need arises. At some point I'll buy another camera (or cameras?), but I don't see that happening for many years. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Are there any other cameras besides Fujifilm T3 &amp; T4 that I should consider?** While I have an art education and experience as a graphical designer and I've taken photos on my smartphones, I have not owned a dedicated camera, so I consider myself to be a beginner. Fujifilm T3 and T4 seem good and I love the variety of controls, but they are also quite advanced. \n\n**Would it be a bad idea to get a camera that advanced with my very limited experience? Fujitsu T3 and T4 cost around 1300 - 2000+ \u20ac in Estonia. Perhaps there is something cheaper that I should take a look at?** \n\n**Besides Fujitsu T3 and T4, are there any other mirrorless cameras that I should take a look at? I live in Europe, Estonia and there is a quite decent used camera market here. I'm hoping to buy the camera used but if that's not possible, I am open to buying it new locally or ordering online (if you know any good locations for buying used or new cameras in Europe that ship in Europe, I'd be very thankful for the suggestion).** \n\n\n**The features I am looking for:** \n\nmultiple physical controls, \n\nmany manual settings,\n\nweight around 500 g (without lens) would be perfect but I'm also open to cameras that are around 400 g or a little less \n\nquality build \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**Oh... my.
