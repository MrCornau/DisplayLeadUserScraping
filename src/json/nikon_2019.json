Unfortunately, it's developed spots along the left side of every image that I've come to assume are oil, visible on solid light coloured backgrounds, which have not changed in the last couple hundred shots.\n\nThey don't shift around with a rocket blower or the clean function. Both lenses produce the same result. They can seem rather big but only because I edit zoomed in on a 28\" 4K monitor. They are generally translucent instead of opaque, but can appear almost black when zoomed out.\n\nHas anyone had experience with cleaning oil off the D610? Unfortunately, I got it as a gift and the purchaser wasn't aware of the whole grey market thing so it's a (J) marked model, meaning warranty and maybe even paid repair are meaningless to me in Canada. No large shops here seem to do sensor cleaning, and the ones that do are extremely poorly reviewed \"camera repair\" shops. The Nikon website doesn't even work for me when I try to schedule a repair due to a security issue with the website that interrupts the process when it gets to the payment stage.  \n\nI'm assuming that I have to get a kit with the cleaning liquid and a bunch of swabs, to do it myself. Some FX-size recommendations would be nice, as none of them stand out in terms of reviews. I live in the Vancouver area. \n\nGenerally, my D610 has been great for me, and helped me improve what I mostly do (product placement-type) and try new things as well, such as portraits and outdoor walkabout photos.
