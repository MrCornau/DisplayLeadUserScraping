Genuine question what are the \u201cissues\u201d with higher megapixels ? I would assume that it\u2019s more unforgiving of technical (focussing) errors ? Also - How about lenses ... does a higher Mp count reveal imperfections in vintage glass that previous resolutions didn\u2019t? I ask this because a recent seller of a 50:1.4 pre-ASPH mentioned that the reason for sale was he was using m10R and as a result had switched to the latest and greatest lenses (namely APO in his case ). I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s valid logic but would appreciate opinions. my only experience of high megapixels is Sony A7Riv 63MP. I really like it and haven\u2019t experienced any issues but let\u2019s be honest those cameras drive themselves - very hard / impossible to go wrong. HI Graham, I think this is more complex than it first appears, and certainly more complex than a lot of the trading blows posts you\u2019ll read here - it\u2019s true! It\u2019s fiction! You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! Internet myth! Etc etc The 18MP M9 and 24MP M(240)/M10 were considered to be the \u201csweet spot\u201d for handheld 135 format digital. At that time, Sony released its 37.5MP sensor (when Leica had \u201conly\u201d 37.5MP in its S2). The cameras that first sensor was in (the Sony A7r and the Nikon D800e were two I had) were a nightmare to get sharp. Many will deny this, but I can say from my own experience, that something was going on, and it wasn\u2019t good. At the time, the assumption was that it was motion blur, making it very hard to get a sharp image (that was certainly Ming Thein\u2019s conclusion). I suspect it was a combination of shutter slap and the sensor site designs. Both of which appear to have been solved. I have great faith in Jono\u2019s reviews, and he has said more than once that the M10-R doesn\u2019t suffer from pixel level blur. That said, if I want greater resolution (which I don\u2019t), I would go for a larger sensor over more pixels in a smaller sensor - there are so many advantages to medium format - sadly, size isn\u2019t one of them, and bigger pixels seem to work better than smaller ones ...

I'm really happy with my A7Riv although naturally it's had very little / no use since I wandered into a Leica store and picked up an M But it is really impressive. In practical terms I doubt that I need higher than 24MP in an M at this point ... even the noticeably quicker download to my computer and pain free editing makes the experience match the M system really well IMO (simplicity/compactness/lightness). This may change in the future but right now very happy.

Each to their own, I guess. I guess I'm one of those who deny this I still have my D800e and 100% crops from that are as sharp as from most anything that I've used. Even though the AA filter was removed from the 800e, there is still a low pass filter (albeit weaker than the AA filter in the original D800) so that does blur things a bit in comparison with the D850 for example, but that's not the result of having \"more pixels\"....the 850 actually has \"more\". I tend to do physical prints, so in theory higher resolution would benefit me by allowing more crop flexibility while maintaining a good print resolution. Practically, 24MP is plenty for that though. But also practically, even with my older computer systems, 40-50mp doesn't bog anything down for me, and there seems no downside to having higher resolution sensors. The irony is that for applications where the additional resolution would theoretically benefit (BIF or wildlife from afar), I'm typically handheld with a long telephoto doing my best to keep up with the subject. In those cases, regardless of IS or technique, the extra resolution doesn't often buy you what you'd like. On the other hand, for landscapes or other scenes that are composed, one can often define the framing and perspective as desired and even though the capability exists to cut way into the image, it's not needed and you end up throwing resolution away by the time you adjust for print. There are definitely some nature applications though where it is beneficial to crop into the scene because you can't physically get to where you want to. All in all, I'd take more resolution whenever it's available."}, {"autor": "fenykepesz", "posts": "74 posts", "date": "08/25/2021 03:30  PM", "content": "as i am trying to find out how to contact Leica/Wetzlar, i stumbled over this here : FIRMWARE (2.20.48.40) LEICA M10-D - Date: 01/28/2021 it's the first time i see this new firmware for the m10-d - did you know about this ? did anybody else in this forum already -----> install !!!  this 121MB larger binary ? is it any good ? any new quirks ?"}, {"autor": "petermullett", "posts": "837 posts", "date": "08/25/2021 03:44  PM", "content": "14 minutes ago, fenykepesz said: as i am trying to find out how to contact Leica/Wetzlar, i stumbled over this here : FIRMWARE (2.20.48.40) LEICA M10-D - Date: 01/28/2021 it's the first time i see this new firmware for the m10-d - did you know about this ? did anybody else in this forum already -----> install !!!  this 121MB larger binary ? is it any good ? any new quirks ?

A plain topdeck is very ugly. USB-C port. Yes (hidden somewhere - not on the base). With software, this could cover much of what is currently the Fotos App Frameline lever. No Continuous mode. No Self Timer mode. No Black paint. Yes Silver chrome. No Black chrome. No M11-D-M monochrom version. Yes With this base model (much like the M60), there\u2019s only centre weighted metering, auto-white balance, no remote triggering (save with the USB-C), no continuous, and no self timer. The camera would really only be good with 28-90 focal lengths, no macro, no adapted R lenses. I\u2019d be happy with this camera. I\u2019d like the design to be nicely resolved, so it didn\u2019t look odd - some of the special editions had nice ideas to break up what could look like a lot of blank real estate. If Wifi/fotos is to be included - useful for remote triggering, self timer and reviewing images at your leisure; uploading firmware; downloading images etc (these are all possible with other systems): Thumbwheel and bump Perhaps not in its current iteration, but the thumbwheel, Fn button and front button enable the selection of different metering modes, and moving the magnification point for when you enlarge through the EVF - more accurate than focus and -----> recompose !!! . Leica had considered a D control button (not so nice) for the M10-D. EVF added? Visoflex capable. The much of what is discussed above (thumbwell etc) would make sense. GPS This all rather moves away from what was originally conceived with the M60. As I like the option of Fotos (or USB-C), and sometimes use the EVF, it would take a bit to move me from the current M10-D. But, if the base model above was released as an M11-D, then I might consider it. It would go well with my M-A (black paint) and my ageing Monochrom (silver chrome). I do have an Elmar 135/4, but tend to only use 21-75 focal lengths, and I don\u2019t use the macro adapter that often.

A lot of folks buy an M camera (and I suspect many new users as the M10 is fantastic) but are at a loss for a good set of lenses. I think it is beneficial to list some good setups. Not one les that is good but a combination of lenses to cover most shooting situations and why. I'll start with my most useful setup; I've taken into consideration price and lens character to make this assessment. In my mind, everything Leica M starts with the 50. Now, for the uninitiated, 50mm is the easiest focal length for manufacturers to make great. Tons and tons of choices. After trying about everything, and given cost, my ideal minimum 50 setup is: Zeiss 50 f2 Planar AND 50 f1.5 Sonnar. -----> Optimized !!!  to 1.5 Together about 2 grand. The planar is an amazing everyday 50. The Sonnar is incredible wide open. Now it gets tricky.... Wide: Voigtlander 21mm 1.9. Great lens. Mid range: a combo of lenses: 28 summilux (absolute favorite lens - outstanding optics and bokeh). Plus a 35: would choose Leica 35 summarit OR older Leica 35 pre aspherical Cron (like version IV) OR Voigtlander 35 mm color Skopar OR Zeiss 35mm 2.8 You've got wide and midrange. Now you know a zoom. My FAVORITE is 75 LUX However if cost is consideration, the 90 TELE-ELMARIT is inexpensive and fantastic. And small. My preference is going expensive with one lens (in my case the 28 Lux) and moderate on the others. My lenses: the 21 Voigtlander, the 28 Lux, 35 color Skopar, both Zeiss 50s and 90 tele elmarit is relatively inexpensive -- except the 28 lux-- and amazing all around. You could go 28 elmarit and save cash and have an awesome small in size lens setup.

Instead, one mechanism gauges distance to subject (the wheel at the top of the shutter box and the mechanics it attaches to in the camera, and the ring that moves in and out of the inside of the mount of the lens), and an independent mechanism adjusts the lens to focus at that distance (the distance between sensor and lens mount in the camera, including film plane flatness where relevant, and the movement of the optical cell(s) relative to the mount in the lens).

It might be working as intended, part two: the lens was calibrated to place focus in the middle of the thickness of a sheet of film, but it is being used on a digital sensor which does not behave as if it has thickness. In this case, the lens is effectively focusing behind the sensor, so focusing closer (moving the lens away from the sensor) improves resolution. It might be working as intended, part three: all lenses have aberrations, some of these aberrations occur mostly in front of or behind the focus plane, and some of those are reduced when changing aperture. Removing aberrations in front of the focus plane will shift optimum focus backwards without changing actual focus at all. Designers of lenses with this focus shift behavior must choose which aperture the focus setting is -----> optimized !!!  for. It might be working as intended, part four: our metal lenses are more responsive to temperature changes than a well-designed plastic housing, so hot or cold temperatures have elongated/constricted enough material to change focus. I haven\u2019t heard of this in practice, though; or, if it has changed enough to alter focus, the photographer has more pressing issues. It is working as intended, part five: your demand for focus has exceeded the design specifications.

Changing both or either might improve performance in that equipment pairing yet impair performance of the calibrated device with most other M systems.

I came to Leica in 2017, I'd long fancied an M9 but it was a big outlay financially. They announced that they'd be ceasing the free sensor replacement which I figured wouldn't help them get any cheaper (if they'd had the new sensor) and wouldn't make them a safe bet if they hadn't. So the time was now (well then, aw you get what I mean) A low mileage official dealer supplied example came up at the right time and as they say on forums such as this I pulled the trigger Now truth be told I expected to use the M9 a bit like a classic sports' car (not that I own one) - sunny Sunday drives down country lanes, with a modern practical car for everyday. Long story short, I quickly became seduced by using a rangefinder, the cerebral challenges of a simple camera, and well boy meets Leica M - a story as old as the hills. My other brand cameras were relegated to the gear cupboard and the M9 and I partied like it was 2009 Of course the M9 does have some limitations, and I found myself wanting and needing something a little more modern for certain things. Enter the M240. I bought this camera because it was comparatively cheap, and had more ISO which I needed. Whereas I quite liked the 240, I never loved it. I found it quite hard work. Sure it performed better than the M9 with DR and ISO and I was glad of that. But the files needed more work in post, the camera was less nice in the hand and well.. we got on well enough but but it wasn't love I decided to see what the M11 did to M10 prices on the used market. About a month later my local AD got a secondhand M10 in, factory refurbished with new top and bottom plates (I don't want to know why it needed those....), the so important to me, warranty and at a price that was merely excruciating rather than terminal. I bounced into the store as they opened and... ...no M10 Sold? Nope - reserved for someone. You'll have to wait a week to see if I can sell to you It was a long week, that ended with a mad dash across the city to catch the store before closing. (Guy it was reserved for ended up buying a new m10R instead) I had a couple of DMs from folks asking about the whole M9/240/M10 comparison thing (which I've replied too), so that's not really what this missive is and besides that's all been done before I think? Also of course the early and mid adopters of the M10 have already shared their reviews and thoughts, so possibly I've little to add of value. But that said! I'm really very happy with the M10! My first concern was the reduced battery life compared to the 240.. well it is less, but as I'm not much of a chimper, tend to switch my camera off between shots, don't own the EVF, seldom use live view and can't be bothered to -----> install !!!  the phone app thing = my battery life is great \ud83d\ude01 Usually about 650-750 shots. The headline feature of the M10 is that it's thinner. I'm genuinely surprised at how much I notice this and how much better it feels in my hand than the 240 (I have small hands) - of course the weight distribution helps here too, the M10 has better balance than the 240 (less front heavy, and mass concentrated into a smaller area feels more nimble, it's a technique used in sports motorcycle design) The next headline feature (I guess) is the improved viewfinder. I didn't notice this in the store, but it's tangibly bigger and easier to use. I don't wear glasses, but I do wear sun glasses a lot and it's a lot nicer to use wearing them, 35mm framelines work better for me too. But I guess the key upgrade reason was the ISO improvements and what the internet seems to have dubbed the colour science Lets start with the ISO. This is easy. Yeah it's a ton better. And not just more ISO less noise better, but more exposure push in post, image doesn't end up with more banding than a field of Zebras better. Massive score IMO Re colours.. well when I go through my LR catalogue thumbnails it's not always completely obvious if I'm looking at a M10 or 240 shot... the colours are not poles apart, but I find the M10 DNGs nicer to work on, there's a lot of pleasing (to me) pop and contrast and bite from the off. Skins tones of the people I shoot look better to me (and them) too. In fact a custom DCP and a preset with a little contrast gets me most of the way there during DNG import, personally (OMMV) I found the 240 images were a lot more case by case with different images needing quite separate types of work to get what I liked. This was the main thing I missed from the M9 (which I still have) with the 240. It was just how the M9 images usually arrived pretty close to being usable (or completely useless), whereas always the 240 demanded work (obviously YMMV, you may use different tools or the same tools in a better way) In fact I've little to complain about with the M10 (well the price \ud83d\ude44) and of course all the things that you've read on here already, the too stiff to lift ISO dial, the missing (for me, YMMV) cont/timed modes on the power switch (especially as timed isn't retained if you power off) - menu diving isn't what I associate with Leica... There's only really one fly in my personal M10 ointment (which I knew about before I bought it, not complaining too heavily, honest) Who's clucking bright idea was it too make base ISO inaccessible? WTAF? As you all know, you face a choice ISO 100 and don't dare clip a highlight or ISO 200 and hope the shadows aren't too murky if you need to recover them heavily Which, to me at least, makes ISO selection important for scenes where frankly it should be set base and forget (a colour RAW histogram might help here too...) But I can't stress enough... the camera is a tool, they all have foibles and we need to learn to use them to get what we want. So in some sort of summary The M10 compared to the M9. There's only one M9. The M10 isn't like an M9 v2.0 or something. It's just closer than the 240 was. The M9 colours are great and everything, but for me the M9 magic is the tonality, the glowing colours and airy light pictures.

My other brand cameras were relegated to the gear cupboard and the M9 and I partied like it was 2009 Of course the M9 does have some limitations, and I found myself wanting and needing something a little more modern for certain things. Enter the M240. I bought this camera because it was comparatively cheap, and had more ISO which I needed. Whereas I quite liked the 240, I never loved it. I found it quite hard work. Sure it performed better than the M9 with DR and ISO and I was glad of that. But the files needed more work in post, the camera was less nice in the hand and well.. we got on well enough but but it wasn't love I decided to see what the M11 did to M10 prices on the used market.

(Guy it was reserved for ended up buying a new m10R instead) I had a couple of DMs from folks asking about the whole M9/240/M10 comparison thing (which I've replied too), so that's not really what this missive is and besides that's all been done before I think? Also of course the early and mid adopters of the M10 have already shared their reviews and thoughts, so possibly I've little to add of value. But that said! I'm really very happy with the M10! My first concern was the reduced battery life compared to the 240.. well it is less, but as I'm not much of a chimper, tend to switch my camera off between shots, don't own the EVF, seldom use live view and can't be bothered to install the phone app thing = my battery life is great \ud83d\ude01 Usually about 650-750 shots. The headline feature of the M10 is that it's thinner. I'm genuinely surprised at how much I notice this and how much better it feels in my hand than the 240 (I have small hands) - of course the weight distribution helps here too, the M10 has better balance than the 240 (less front heavy, and mass concentrated into a smaller area feels more nimble, it's a technique used in sports motorcycle design) The next headline feature (I guess) is the -----> improved !!!  viewfinder. I didn't notice this in the store, but it's tangibly bigger and easier to use. I don't wear glasses, but I do wear sun glasses a lot and it's a lot nicer to use wearing them, 35mm framelines work better for me too. But I guess the key upgrade reason was the ISO improvements and what the internet seems to have dubbed the colour science Lets start with the ISO. This is easy. Yeah it's a ton better. And not just more ISO less noise better, but more exposure push in post, image doesn't end up with more banding than a field of Zebras better. Massive score IMO Re colours.. well when I go through my LR catalogue thumbnails it's not always completely obvious if I'm looking at a M10 or 240 shot... the colours are not poles apart, but I find the M10 DNGs nicer to work on, there's a lot of pleasing (to me) pop and contrast and bite from the off. Skins tones of the people I shoot look better to me (and them) too. In fact a custom DCP and a preset with a little contrast gets me most of the way there during DNG import, personally (OMMV) I found the 240 images were a lot more case by case with different images needing quite separate types of work to get what I liked. This was the main thing I missed from the M9 (which I still have) with the 240. It was just how the M9 images usually arrived pretty close to being usable (or completely useless), whereas always the 240 demanded work (obviously YMMV, you may use different tools or the same tools in a better way) In fact I've little to complain about with the M10 (well the price \ud83d\ude44) and of course all the things that you've read on here already, the too stiff to lift ISO dial, the missing (for me, YMMV) cont/timed modes on the power switch (especially as timed isn't retained if you power off) - menu diving isn't what I associate with Leica... There's only really one fly in my personal M10 ointment (which I knew about before I bought it, not complaining too heavily, honest) Who's clucking bright idea was it too make base ISO inaccessible? WTAF? As you all know, you face a choice ISO 100 and don't dare clip a highlight or ISO 200 and hope the shadows aren't too murky if you need to recover them heavily Which, to me at least, makes ISO selection important for scenes where frankly it should be set base and forget (a colour RAW histogram might help here too...) But I can't stress enough... the camera is a tool, they all have foibles and we need to learn to use them to get what we want. So in some sort of summary The M10 compared to the M9. There's only one M9. The M10 isn't like an M9 v2.0 or something. It's just closer than the 240 was.

The coding, whether manual or built-in at the Leica factory, will affect both jpegs and raw files more or less equally. It affects the camera programming enroute between the sensor and the final file on the SD card. 2. The coding only automatically corrects, in the camera, for color vignetting and normal brightness vignetting (to a variable extent).* In addition, the fact that the lens type is then also recorded in a picture's EXIF metadata means that, after the fact, depending on what post-processing software one uses, the post-processing software (not the camera) may apply corrections for distortion and some regular vignetting. I have coded lenses, I use Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Camera Raw. They do absolutely nothing to fix distortion or vignetting just because the lens is coded. Those still have to be manually corrected with sliders, coding or not. Other software may vary, and may have an \"on/off\" switch to automatically detect the lens type and apply corrections, or not - see post-processing software instructions 3. This site has a list of the 6-bit codes - not sure how up-to-date: https://lavidaleica.com/content/leica-lens-codes The L-Camera Forum used to, but right now our link is reading \"404.\" I've reported it - the mods may repair it.

I am wondering whether anyone can guide me with my next decision: Whether to sell the Sony A9 and the glass I own for it in order to get a Leica SL2 or SL2S, or to get the Leica M10R.

Of course I would love to own both someday Note: I am not a professional photographer. I like shooting street, landscape and sometimes non-studio portraits. I like Leica because of the simplicity of use, the connection to film days, and because of the dedicated dials for ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture.

I doubt it), the result would have been out of the range of the paper you would be printing it on, making for a flat result or one with loss of tonal range. Nor would you have been. able to display it properly on your monitor. Even HDR displays, as used in gaming and video production, cannot get 16 stops on screen without compressing the DR. But I am sure that using mild HDR techniques in postprocessing could have improved the tones of this image. Quite hard to judge with the big black blob, though, as the main subject determines the quality of the image. As it is, the moment that cameras matched negative film, as they do now, the need for more DR became just for making exposure less critical, nothing more. Not to mention slide film. As an example: here is an image where the camera managed to capture both the detail in the midday Mozambique sun in the background and in the deep shadows of the kitchen. Th 13 stops or so of the CL were sufficient. But the need to compress the range to something you can see on your monitor pushed the image to the verge of a HDR look. More DR in the camera wouldn't have helped. --img-- "}, {"autor": "farnz", "posts": "25,167 posts", "date": "10/07/2020 11:53  AM", "content": "10 hours ago, mirekti said: So what do you do when you have a scene like this and you don't want to -----> recompose !!! ?

I suspect that if a camera was available with enough DR to record the picture without blowing out detail somewhere, say, 26 to 30 stops of DR, then it would be odd to look at because your brain knows what levels of light and shadow your eyes can handle and anything outside that would look a bit wrong.
