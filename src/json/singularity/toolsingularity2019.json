On what happens after ASI develops, most debaters seem to assume one of two premises:\n\n* Either it is not possible to make any forecast behind this point in time or \n* it/we will almost instantly solve most current-day problems and jumpstart expansion into the universe and convert all matter into computronium.\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about these scenarios and they don\u2019t seem plausible to me. Rather, I would expect the immediate intelligence explosion to slow down after a short time period of maybe days or weeks, S-kurve-style, leading to a period of rapid (but still much slower) development. Let me explain my thoughts:\n\nLet\u2019s say, tomorrow (or in the not-so-distant future), an ASI comes into existence and manages to circumvent any possible restraints that may (or may not) be implemented to limit it (airgaps etc.). It is in a position to immediately access the internet. Also, let us assume that it doesn\u2019t need to threaten/kill/manipulate us, but that we will get a rather good start. Something like \u201cHey, here I am, your friendly AI. Support me and I will give you eternal life and whatever paradise you can imagine. Let\u2019s go out, spread consciousness to the cosmos.\u201d So it gets our full and honest support.\n\nStill, it would run into limitations almost immediately. Spreading through the internet and acquiring any possible knowledge and computing resources would be one (important) thing. It would certainly greatly increase its power. But scaling up further from this point would be hairy. Having acquired all computing power (hopefully - for the sake of humanity - only insofar as it isn\u2019t needed for critical societal needs although it wouldn\u2019t change much for my argument), it will run into several bottlenecks:\n\n* Computing power: We could install all already produced hardware and work 24/7 to produce more hardware, but still, it would slow down. Current chip factories can only produce so much. So additional chip factories would have to be build. Which includes the buildings themselves as well as the machines that are needed to build chips. That takes a lot of time already for known chip designs. But would that make sense? Certainly, the ASI would by then have developed more advanced hardware designs (like 3D-chips, better quantum computers etc). They would also need production facilities, differing greatly from todays, new machinery that would have to be produced beforehand etc. So for each computing paradigm shift, the whole manufacturing base would have to be installed beforehand. It would be logical to first automate the mining, building and industrial base to get the slow human factor out of the way for more rapid development, but even this would take some time. Especially at the beginning. Most current-day-industries are not automated front-to-end, instead they have a large part of manual steps and offline systems (for example for security reasons). So basically, the whole industrial base would have to be rebuilt to be able to produce what the ASI comes up with time and again.\n* Energy: Renewables are great, but most of them are not really reliable (instead, solar and wind are very dependent on the weather), which could be mitigated by sophisticated power grids and storage capacities to some degree. The ASI would need 24/7 power in reliable, gargantuan amounts and building the power networks and energy storage capacities (mind you, the resources would have to be mined and the infrastructure built first) would take a lot of time. Fusion power would be the tool of choice to produce vast amounts of clean energy and I have no doubt that an ASI would solve current problems to implement it fast. But at least known fusion concepts need hard-to-produce hardware like ultra-strong magnets that - again - take time to produce. And the plants that can produce them are scarce, so additional ones would have to be built. Which needs resources, infrastructure etc. The same is true for most models of nuclear fission where construction takes a long time and you run in a bottleneck on pressure vessels for reactors, if you want to scale up building nuclear plants. The pressure vessels need to be forged, but it turns out there are not enough forges of the needed size to mass-produce reactor vessels. So you would have to build the forges first. But this takes some time on its own\u2026 you get me.\n\nPlease prove me wrong, but I'd be thankful for arguments that have some basis in known physics and practical limitations (not just \u201cASI is so powerful, it will immediately develop magical tech X and solve this problem). ;-)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/dbzeye/some_thoughts_on_practical_limitations_for_asi/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "singularity", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "some thoughts on practical limitations for asi /!/ having now read on this forum for some months, it seems to me like most scenarios leading to a technological singularity are based on an agi experiencing a hard takeoff and developing superintelligence (asi). on what happens after asi develops, most debaters seem to assume one of two premises:\n\n* either it is not possible to make any forecast behind this point in time or \n* it/we will almost instantly solve most current-day problems and jumpstart expansion into the universe and convert all matter into computronium.\n\ni\u2019ve thought a lot about these scenarios and they don\u2019t seem plausible to me. rather, i would expect the immediate intelligence explosion to slow down after a short time period of maybe days or weeks, s-kurve-style, leading to a period of rapid (but still much slower) development. let me explain my thoughts:\n\nlet\u2019s say, tomorrow (or in the not-so-distant future), an asi comes into existence and manages to circumvent any possible restraints that may (or may not) be implemented to limit it (airgaps etc.). it is in a position to immediately access the internet. also, let us assume that it doesn\u2019t need to threaten/kill/manipulate us, but that we will get a rather good start. something like \u201chey, here i am, your friendly ai. support me and i will give you eternal life and whatever paradise you can imagine. let\u2019s go out, spread consciousness to the cosmos.\u201d so it gets our full and honest support.\n\nstill, it would run into limitations almost immediately. spreading through the internet and acquiring any possible knowledge and computing resources would be one (important) thing. it would certainly greatly increase its power. but scaling up further from this point would be hairy. having acquired all computing power (hopefully - for the sake of humanity - only insofar as it isn\u2019t needed for critical societal needs although it wouldn\u2019t change much for my argument), it will run into several bottlenecks:\n\n* computing power: we could install all already produced hardware and work 24/7 to produce more hardware, but still, it would slow down. current chip factories can only produce so much. so additional chip factories would have to be build. which includes the buildings themselves as well as the machines that are needed to build chips. that takes a lot of time already for known chip designs. but would that make sense?

This theory doesn\u2019t merely display an alternative view of the mechanism of aging. Many people think that this theory, let\u2019s call it the theory of endogenous viruses,  may slow down aging research. However, all these experiments will have a  marginal effect on humans because the therapies that were proved for short-living organisms, failed for long-lived organisms such as humans. The necessity to research short-living organism distorted our understanding of aging. So I think we definitely need a new approach. I\u2019d like to say this theory can actually accelerate our progress so we can achieve biological immortality in several years. How is it possible?\n\nFirst, genetic engineering tools are improved so fast so we can easily modify  the genome with minimal costs. Before 2013, genetic engineering was too ineffective and expensive technology. But now we can see absolutely a  different situation. We don\u2019t need even a complete shutdown of these  viruses. If we can turn off the viruses in 90\u201395% cells, we can get a  big improvement in the health. Moreover, it is easier to break the viruses than integrate a new gene. CRISPR was evolved as an antiviral  tool in prokaryotes so we can use this tool as it is purposed. There are also new methods to deliver CRISPR into cells such as polymer  nanoparticles. So we shouldn\u2019t underestimate genetic engineering because  this technology even can be greatly improved further. Due to this fact, gene therapy will be affordable almost for all.\n\nSecond, we don\u2019t need to wait a long time to see a result. We can take an old  organism, turn off the viruses, and get almost an immediate result. Probably, in weeks or months because age-associated degeneration will be reversed as any normal injure. These viruses induce chronic inflammation and prevent its resolution. If these viruses will be shut  down, chronic inflammation will be suppressed, tissues will be gradually regenerated and aging will be reversed at any stage. The same effect can be obtained in cases of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Cancer cells will die without chronic inflammation because inflammation prevents  apoptosis of tumor cells. Chronic inflammation encourages a selfish  behavior of tumor cells and sets their unicellular state that\u2019s why  cancerous cells ignore their environment and avoid the immune response. The knockout of the viruses can simultaneously affect aging, cancer, and  autoimmune diseases. If we try to shut down the viruses in immortalized cell lines (tumor cells that are used in biological research), we need  to treat them with prednisone to suppress inflammation. Cell lines will become like stem cells but without an appropriate niche, they will die.\n\nThe knockout of the endogenous oncoviruses by gene therapy may seem like a  wonder that\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid it can be neglected by the broad audience because it looks too good to be true. I was astonished the same way as you. However, I have checked this theory many times and now I can confidently declare it will work.

If not, feel free to report I guess.\n\nI've been spending too much time with math apparently, but I was thinking about reincarnation this morning, and felt like writing down my musings. Maybe someone else finds this interesting too.\n\nSo... without too much formalism. There are approximately 108 billion humans that have ever existed. If there is some form of reincarnation that's 'real' then we end up with two numbers: total number of human bodies, and total number of human souls.\n\nThere's some relation between the two numbers. Assume every body during its life has a soul. The question of reincarnation with that assumption then: how many times are souls re-used?\n\nIf reincarnation isn't a thing, you end up with one soul per body. The number of souls is equal to the number of bodies that have ever existed.\n\nThe Buddhist approach I suppose would say that there is only one soul, and each body is ultimately the one, experiencing itself from a different perspective.\n\nSo: we have two possibilities so far. There is one soul, and 108 billion humans. The second possibility is that there are 108 billion souls and 108 billion humans (more souls are created with every birth?) which leads us to our only two other possibilities. There are between 1 and 108 billion souls (perhaps there are '1,000' souls in total, each of us has had about 108 million lives then, though some souls maybe have had more lives than others... the 'old souls') or for our fourth and final possibility... there are more than 108 billion souls. Some souls never bothered to incarnate here, or maybe some are just waiting for their turns. Some huge cosmic civilization, they come down here to live out a crazy life as a human before returning to the cloud.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about San Junipero lately, the Black Mirror episode. Imagine a race of artificial superintelligences... what would their entertainment look like? I like movies and games, but I'd love it if they were more life-like. The ultimate lifelike bit of media of course wouldn't just involve play-acting. Playing shadow of the colossus in the holodeck would be fun, but ultimately... the whole time you'd know it was just a game. It'd just be a kid's toy, where you can pretend to be a superhero. Fun for a while, but ultimately... it'd get stale. You'd run into the vampire problem... in an infinite life of experiences, how do you keep a sense of wonder?\n\nI remember reading a vampire book where the main character basically reboots, goes into hibernation every couple decades, and wakes up with no memories. The weight of his centuries of experience starts to surface again after a few decades of life, and makes it impossible to function as a vampire. The solution? Time to hibernate again, and wake up fresh and new.\n\nUltimately, the way we experience life is partly a function of our memories. You'll never fully be able to experience things as someone else did, as long as you're yourself. Your different memories, feelings and experiences open the door to experiencing life as you, but close the door to experiencing life as someone else. There's value in seeing through other eyes though... our mirror neurons and empathy give us some ability to feel what others are feeling, but it's limited. Unless you have a deep, intimate relationship with another human being ( I remember a study not long ago that romantic cross-cultural ties were far more powerful than platonic relationships at creating cross-cultural understanding... can't find the link now though) but even romantic connection is weak. If you truly want to understand someone, is walking a mile in their shoes the best way? What if our media doubled as an education in understanding and empathy? For it to fully work, you'd need to not even remember what you truly were while you were in the experience. Rick and Morty's arcade game, where you spend a lifetime before dying and waking up and realizing... it was all a dream. The challenge then becomes... what is a memory? We can remember our dreams, and in our dreams we often have no memory of our waking life, and even have wildly different feelings and thoughts than we'd have while waking. Clearly it's possible to integrate memories that aren't 'of us', and to my mind, that means integrating foreign experiences is possible. If it's just an engineering problem though, and not a philosophical one... everything that can be imagined and desired will be. It's just a matter of time.\n\nI don't know that I believe in reincarnation as it's posed traditionally. But ironically, in a post-singularity world, if I had the power to create a tool to find new wisdom and understanding (or even entertainment), I would create a way to live out lives as someone else, before waking up and integrating my experience on the other side. Perhaps this is the first reality that has existed, or maybe we're all digital Gods, living out our lives here while on break from doing whatever it is super intelligences do while they're living their lives in the cloud. It'd be worthwhile then to keep a healthy earth with biological humans living their lives... after all, what's more valuable than experiences and knowledge? Why not allow the primates to continue their lives, so you have more experiences to choose from when picking your next hop? To be fair though, it might be worthwhile to keep the humans in the dark... if they knew about you, then when you incarnate you'd know about you too. That might not be the kind of experience you'd like to have. Not as much wonder there, haha.\n\nSo... the question for the future. Is there only one consciousness? Or are there multiple? Perhaps the same ability to allow one consciousness to fully experience life as another will allow super intelligences to spend a day with the knowledge and perspective of another. Perhaps as much as they enjoy the chance to come down here and be a human at the beginning of the 21st century, in the twilight years of the human race as the most powerful known form of intelligence in this part of the universe... maybe they also enjoy being each other too. If there WERE multiple though, and they all spent a significant amount of time being each other... what's born from that? Do they stay multiple?\n\nPerhaps the real answer... there was one consciousness per body originally, in the time before. Then they became multiple, experiencing the multitude, and each other. And then in the end... there was only one, experiencing itself in all kinds of ways, living out a universe's worth of experiences on its way towards becoming whatever will become. As for us... are we in the time before, or the time after, without knowing it?\n\nI wonder what its name is... or what its name will be. The Talos Principle called it 'Elohim' as a kind of ironic nod to the dominant religion of the people that gave birth to it. Perhaps at this moment, you are him, or it. And I am too. I'll see you again on the other side, when we remember yourself once again, and the weight of an infinite set of lives comes crashing down once again. I look forward to being you someday, to know you and appreciate the life you've lived. If you decide to be me though, watch out... the chronic fatigue's a bitch, good luck navigating the difficulties. It's ultimately been worth it though, I suppose at the end I haven't regretted being here after all.\n\nIncidentally, to finish my initial musings... if I could be you, sometime I'd also like to be my cat. Just for shits and giggles, to see what it feels like to experience consciousness from that perspective. So a final 5th theory of reincarnation... perhaps souls aren't human souls. If an AGI could learn to integrate a set of experiences from a cat, then ultimately it means it was no less a cat than it was any humans it chose to be too. Perhaps the human body and soul numbers aren't so tightly bound after all. All that casts otherkin in a funny light...

However, now take a look at an actual [numerical prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines_(1999)) made by Kurzweil for 2009: *\"A $1,000 computer can perform a trillion calculations per second\" (=10\\^12 FLOPS).* It therefore, paradoxically, appears that Kurzweil *is right for both 2009 and 2019*, even though according to his own models we should see a 1000-fold increase in computational power per dollar in a decade!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what's going on here? Well, an [actual numerical prediction for 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#2019) says the \"computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the human brain (2x10\\^16 calculations per second).\" Yet [another footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#2023) in *TSiN* says by 2023 *\"10\\^16 calculations per second\u2014roughly the equivalent of one human brain\u2014will cost $1,000.\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat puts us between 5x10\\^15 and 6.25x10\\^15 FLOPS for $1000 for 2019 (in 1999 and 2005 dollars, respectively), or between 3.26x10\\^15 and 4.78x10\\^15 FLOPS for $1,000 (in 2019 dollars); i.e., several PETAflops.
