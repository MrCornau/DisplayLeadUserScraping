Texas @ Austin) asks in [his paper](http://inspirehep.net/record/1236720/files/arXiv%3A1306.0159.pdf), \"Does quantum mechanics ... put interesting limits on an external agent's ability to scan, copy, and predict human brains ... ?\"\u00a0 He says he regards this \"as an unsolved scientific question, and a big one,\" and then gives one possible explanation of how physics might explain that conscious brains can't be copied (if in fact they can't).\u00a0 In a [blog post](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2756), he points to an empirical fact \"about the brain that currently separates it from any existing computer program.\u00a0 Namely, we know how to copy a computer program ... how to rerun it ... how to transfer it from one substrate to another.\u00a0 With the brain, we don't

\"the consensus of most of my friends and colleagues.\"\n\nThere are a few other scientists who cautiously suggest that brains can't be copied or that brains aren't computers (one example

papers in which neurobiologists have sliced rat brains (or whatever) is inadequate, because that says nothing to support the assumption that brains can be copied *over* the assumption that brains cannot be copied.\u00a0 \u00a0And extrapolating into the future (\"If we can slice rat brains today, then in 50-100 years we'll be able to digitize them and copy them...\") is not evidence for your

\"consensus.\"\u00a0 Scientific truth does not equal consensus.\u00a0 I don't care (and nor should you) what a \"majority\" of scientists believe if those beliefs are not founded on scientific data and evidence.\u00a0 Further, considering that anyone who openly questions these assumptions has to apologetically tiptoe on eggshells, for fear of offending the majority, it's difficult or impossible to know whether there really is any consensus on this issue.\n\n\\*\u00a0 Please be aware of your own assumptions.\u00a0 For example, if you reply that \"consciousness must be capable of being
