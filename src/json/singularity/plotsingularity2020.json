The death of democracy &amp; of republican governments began in the 1980s and still so few people realize it /!/ [Repeating what I said here](https://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/22502-how-democracy-dies-another-otherworldly-alternative/).\n\nThink of all the traditional ways democracy is imagined as being slain. Perhaps it's through civic decline, information bubbles, or simple imposition of tyranny by an opposing force. \n\nThe thing is, democracy is fragile. Those who say it's the most stable system of government are taken by propaganda\u2014 democracy is probably the most *unstable* form of government, save for ideological totalitarianism (which tends to believe its own BS and fall for its own lies, which leads to it collapsing due to lying to itself about its own health; see Nazi Germany and Khmer Rouge's Cambodia). This is because democracy relies on an educated populace that is politically and economically engaged. Democracy by itself is nothing. There's this bizarre bit of propaganda going around that \"the USA isn't a democracy; it's a constitutional republic,\" which is baffling to my ears\u2014 that's like saying a car isn't an engine but a chassis. There's no such thing a a \"democracy\" government. Republics function regardless of if they utilize a democracy or aristocracy or ergatocracy or technocracy. Those are just different engines.\n\nDemocracy is a good system on paper because of the typical function of governments is to repress some marginalized group that they don't recognize as citizens\u2014 and that group is invariably the one that does not act as a central power base for the sovereign. \n\nAn aristocratic monarchy would do best to *not* repress aristocrats, for example. \n\nTherefore, a democratic republican government would do best to not repress and disenfranchise its own citizenry. Ideally, this makes democracy egalitarian and free. Depending on how that government is set up, said citizens could either hold power directly or through representatives (a direct democracy is still not its own government *system*; it can still be a republic, which is basically just a fancy way to say a \"people's government\" as opposed to a monarchy/chiefdom/khanate/etc.). \n\nDrawing power from the average citizenry *ideally* makes a republic stronger because the concerns of the average citizen is heard. \n\nThe reason why autocracies, monarchies, dictatorships, and whatnot fall apart is because their leaders and ruling classes grow horribly out of touch with the common people. When your rulers live their entire lives being fed with studded gold spoons and pampered into dolls, how could they ever understand your concerns? They *can't*. They become too obsessed with vanity and court politics, and their ideas of how to appeal to the common people come off similar to someone trying to appeal to 2020s teens by using 1950s lingo\u2014 laughable at best, infuriating most times because it's clear they don't care. \n\nOf course, the problem is that democracy fosters these same people too. It's impossible to prevent the accumulation of wealth and/or power in a world of scarcity, so those old same human sins and vices reappear time and time again, and typically begin undermining democratic processes as the money-hungry and power mad take control\u2014 and then work overtime to *keep* control. The interesting quirk about democracy is that you can make it kill itself if you do the right things in the right order. \n\n#**But that's not the point.**\n\nWe already *know* how democracy dies. The ancient Romans could've told you the same thing. And yet democracy still came back after the Romans. It didn't even take a long time\u2014 city-state republics were already re-appearing by the 600s and flourished in small ways for about a thousand years until they really got going in the early modern era (though still surrounded by monarchies until the 1900s). So the appeal and usefulness has never been lost on people. \n\nBut in all that time, democracies and republics were host to human beings. Humans haven't changed all that much in 50,000 years. \n\nImagine that, in 1848, God actually returned to Earth. Except this wasn't the start of the End Times. No, God just wanted to become an American citizen, and when He got bored, He'd just go back and we'd be lost among ourselves again. The United States of America would cease to function as a republic almost immediately. \n\nGod decides to start a business, but doesn't limit Himself to make it fair for humans. That means that, within seconds, His business is now the wealthiest and most powerful business on Earth because he has perfect omniscience, perfect resource management, and perfect profit margins. Are you seriously going to go into business to compete against *God*? By the time you've gotten some buddies and workers together and started painting your company logo, He's already achieved 100% market share in the economy and owns every plot of land. Not only that, but He did that before the first synapse in your brain fired to let  you decide that you wanted to start a business in the first place. \n\nIf He's that omnipotent, then why not let Him run for office? He's the most qualified candidate for *every* position ever, including those which do not yet exist. Modern computing was only about 10 years old in 1848, and He's already gotten a Department of Computer Technology up and running. \n\nNow God is president, and He can react to events before world leaders that caused them are born in the first place. For example, the USA won World War 2 in 1848. \n\nHow does democracy function when God exists? ***It doesn't***. Don't delude yourself into thinking that democracy has any place in a world of such unbelievable power.\n\n#Now replace \"God\" with \"ASI\" and the exact same scenario applies.\n\nHowever, it wouldn't be an immediate cultural deconstruction. Indeed, it's going to last decades. The start of democracy's final and truest demise started the first time an artificial narrow intelligence was used to increase productivity in some political or economic matter. The first expert systems of the 1980s heralded the defeat of democracy and of republican governments. Stock market bots are accelerating it. \n\nThis is how AI is going to \"overthrow\" humanity. It won't be through Skynet becoming sapient overnight and then sending humanoid robots through the streets exterminating humans en masse. It will be a boring overthrow that occurs through years and years and years of attrition as governments and corporations seek faster, more efficient tools for governance until eventually there are agents in this world that can think for 10,000 years in a few minutes at levels of intelligence far beyond anything possible by humans. \n\nIf you think about the future in such a way, you see that AI overlords are inevitable, but in the most boring possible way.\n\n \n\nRight now, we already live in an era of automated stock markets and enterprise expert systems. But in the future, as more and more capable AI is integrated into business and government for different purposes (such as optimization and cognitive assistance), we'll start to see the realms of politics and economics really speed up. More management decisions will be automated, and soon even executive decisions will follow. \n\n \n\nAt first, this can greatly assist humans. We'll have these agents parse all the relevant data and optimize them for the most efficient solutions to any given problem.\n\n \n\nBut then more businesses automate. More leave executive decisions to these superbots. And the data coming in requires faster and faster responses to more and more complex information.\n\n \n\nSoon, you need to be the equivalent of a nuclear scientist just to understand the basics,  and that's if you had several days to sit on it. You need to make a decision within an hour. And then a minute. Failure to do this means your business goes under within just a few weeks. \n\n \n\nAnd it goes doubly so for government. Bots are sending you 100 years of information in a day and need you to act immediately.  But you can't, Mr. President. You're only human. The fastest brain signal is only 270 miles per hour, whereas these bots have light-speed computing capabilities: 670,616,629 miles per hour. \n\n \n\nAt some point, it makes no sense to let humans govern. It's literally impossible to keep up. Humans now get in the way.\n\n \n\nSay a citizens group organized for a vote on how to limit the powers of AI. It takes 8 hours from start to finish.\n\n \n\nIn those 8 hours, the AIs have accomplished 5,000 years worth of thought and governance (which is a *generously* small amount given their capabilities). They've modeled every single possibility of that vote hundreds of times over. They already taken appropriate actions. By the time the vote is done, the whole point of it is moot. Even when we try to be self-sufficient and independent, the machines are already a thousand steps ahead of us anyway.\n\n \n\nHuman enhancement doesn't change anything for the same reasons. Not all humans will upgrade, and the fact we have to toss away biology just to keep up proves the point that something has changed and democracy is obsolete.\n\n \n\nThis is all very outlandish, so it makes sense it's not discussed often. That and \"AI took over the world over the course of decades through iterative improvements in efficiency\" isn't quite as exciting as \"killer robots slaughtered and enslaved their arrogant human masters.\" But that is the most likely outcome. If we're ruled over by AI, it's because we let it.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/gg7bv7/democracy_wont_survive_the_21st_century_the_death/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "singularity", "result": true, "Selector": "plot", "selectorShort": "plot", "MarkedSent": "democracy won't survive the 21st century. the death of democracy &amp; of republican governments began in the 1980s and still so few people realize it /!/ [repeating what i said here](https://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/22502-how-democracy-dies-another-otherworldly-alternative/).\n\nthink of all the traditional ways democracy is imagined as being slain. perhaps it's through civic decline, information bubbles, or simple imposition of tyranny by an opposing force. \n\nthe thing is, democracy is fragile. those who say it's the most stable system of government are taken by propaganda\u2014 democracy is probably the most *unstable* form of government, save for ideological totalitarianism (which tends to believe its own bs and fall for its own lies, which leads to it collapsing due to lying to itself about its own health; see nazi germany and khmer rouge's cambodia). this is because democracy relies on an educated populace that is politically and economically engaged. democracy by itself is nothing. there's this bizarre bit of propaganda going around that \"the usa isn't a democracy; it's a constitutional republic,\" which is baffling to my ears\u2014 that's like saying a car isn't an engine but a chassis. there's no such thing a a \"democracy\" government. republics function regardless of if they utilize a democracy or aristocracy or ergatocracy or technocracy. those are just different engines.\n\ndemocracy is a good system on paper because of the typical function of governments is to repress some marginalized group that they don't recognize as citizens\u2014 and that group is invariably the one that does not act as a central power base for the sovereign. \n\nan aristocratic monarchy would do best to *not* repress aristocrats, for example. \n\ntherefore, a democratic republican government would do best to not repress and disenfranchise its own citizenry. ideally, this makes democracy egalitarian and free. depending on how that government is set up, said citizens could either hold power directly or through representatives (a direct democracy is still not its own government *system*; it can still be a republic, which is basically just a fancy way to say a \"people's government\" as opposed to a monarchy/chiefdom/khanate/etc.). \n\ndrawing power from the average citizenry *ideally* makes a republic stronger because the concerns of the average citizen is heard. \n\nthe reason why autocracies, monarchies, dictatorships, and whatnot fall apart is because their leaders and ruling classes grow horribly out of touch with the common people. when your rulers live their entire lives being fed with studded gold spoons and pampered into dolls, how could they ever understand your concerns?
