Why do I not care about artificial intelligence? (Part 1) /!/ Yin Wang: Automatic programming is impossible. Why do I not care about artificial intelligence?\n\nSome people have heard that I want to start a business and have suggested some ideas to fudge the mass. They said that since you are a programming language expert and now artificial intelligence (AI) is very hot, you can actually create an \"automatic programming system\", claiming to automatically generate programs, replace the programmer's work, and save a lot of Labor expenditure, so that you can pull investments in the \"AI rush.\"\n\nSomeone even gave me its name, \"DeepCoder ( = Deep Learning + Coder)\". The slogan is: \"With DeepCoder, there's no need for Top Coder!\" Others have pointed out the latest research being bombastically bragged about in this direction, such as Microsoft's Robust Fill...\n\nI would thank these people for their concern, but I don't care or feel optimistic about artificial intelligence. Now let me briefly talk about my opinions.\n\nMachine-like heart\n\nMany people like to advocate artificial intelligence, automatic cars, robots and other technologies, but if you look closely, you will find that not only these people do not understand what human intelligence is, or what the limitations of artificial intelligence are, but also the hearts of these \"AI men\" have been seriously mechanized. They have lost their humanity more or less as if they have forgotten that they are human, forgotten what human need most, and forgotten the value of the human. These people are like what Chaplin pointed out in the final speech of the \"Great Dictator\": \"A machine-like person, a machine-like heart.\"\n\nWhenever AI is mentioned, these people must be ambitiously claiming to \u201creplace human work\u201d and \u201csave labor costs\u201d. For the time being, we will not discuss whether these goals can be achieved, but they and my values are completely contradictory from the beginning. A great company should create real new value for society, instead of trying to \u201csave\u201d any labor costs and making people unemployed! It makes me feel terrible even to think about it that I create a company whose biggest contributions are to let thousands of people lose their jobs, save \u201clabor spending\u201d for insatiable people, increase the polarization between rich and poor, concentrate power in the hands of a very small number of people and in the end, make the people unable to make their life, leading to the desolation and even collapse of society...\n\nI can't imagine living in such a world, and even if it would make me the richest person in the world, it doesn't make sense. There are too many things in the world that can't be exchanged using the money. If I walk on the street and can't see people's happy smiles or leisurely paces, no cordial greetings, cares, or humors, and no sweet romantic love, but only see the homeless all over the place overwhelmed with pains, the stinking urinary smell they left behind goes into my nostrils, and wherever I go, I'm worried about being robbed, because people have no other way to live beside stealing and robbing...\n\nIf artificial intelligence succeeds, this may be the final result. Fortunately, there is plenty of evidence that artificial intelligence is never going to be successful.\n\nMy artificial intelligence dream\n\nMany people may not know that I used to be an \"AI fanatic.\" I have also been crazy about artificial intelligence, and deemed it as my \"great ideal.\" I also used to comment on \"human beings\" at every turn, as if the machine can be compared with human beings, or even higher than human beings. When Dark Blue defeated Kasparov, I once marveled: \"Oh, comes the doom of us human beings!\" I also thought that once there are two magic weapons (Oh, I'm joking. They're actually two slogans): \"logic\" and \"learning\", the machine will surpass human intelligence sooner or later. However, I did not figure out how this should be achieved, nor did I figure out the meanings for achieving this.\n\nThe story begins more than a decade ago when artificial intelligence was in its winter. At the library of Tsinghua University, I stumbled upon a long-lost Peter Norvig's masterpiece, Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming (PAIP). Like an archaeologist, I began to ponder and implement the various classic AI algorithms. PAIP's algorithm focuses on logic and reasoning, because in its age, many AI researchers thought human intelligence, in the final analysis, is logical reasoning. They naively believe that with things like predicate logic, first-order logic, with abilities to express \"cause - result\", \"not only - but also\", what \"exists\", and what is \"for all\", the machines can have intelligence. So they designed a variety of logic-based algorithms, expert systems, and even designed the logic-based programming language Prolog, calling it \"the fifth generation programming language.\" In the end, they encountered insurmountable obstacles. Many AI companies could not achieve their boasted goals. Various \"neuron-based\" machines could not solve practical problems. Huge government and private investment were lost. Artificial intelligence entered its winter.\n\nI met PAIP in that winter. Although it didn't make me dedicated to the field of artificial intelligence, it made me fall in love with Lisp and programming language. It is also because of this book that for the first time I implemented the A* and other algorithms easily and in a structured way, and understood the true meaning of them. Also because of PAIP, I first understood what the \"modularity\" of a program is. I started using small \"tool functions\" in my own program instead of worrying about the \"function call overhead\" that many people are worried about. The two books, PAIP and SICP, led me to devote to the field of programming languages and be fortunate enough to get the guidance of the originators in this field.\n\nAfter PAIP, I was lost in machine learning for a while, because someone told me that machine learning is a new chapter in artificial intelligence. However, I gradually realized that the so-called artificial intelligence and machine learning have little to do with true human intelligence. As for the actual problems, the classic algorithm in PAIP is quite naive and complicated, and it is impossible to solve large-scale practical problems. The most important problem is that I don't see the algorithm in PAIP has anything to do with \"intelligent\". The term \"machine learning\" is completely nominal.

it makes me feel terrible even to think about it that i create a company whose biggest contributions are to let thousands of people lose their jobs, save \u201clabor spending\u201d for insatiable people, increase the polarization between rich and poor, concentrate power in the hands of a very small number of people and in the end, make the people unable to make their life, leading to the desolation and even collapse of society...\n\ni can't imagine living in such a world, and even if it would make me the richest person in the world, it doesn't make sense. there are too many things in the world that can't be exchanged using the money. if i walk on the street and can't see people's happy smiles or leisurely paces, no cordial greetings, cares, or humors, and no sweet romantic love, but only see the homeless all over the place overwhelmed with pains, the stinking urinary smell they left behind goes into my nostrils, and wherever i go, i'm worried about being robbed, because people have no other way to live beside stealing and robbing...\n\nif artificial intelligence succeeds, this may be the final result. fortunately, there is plenty of evidence that artificial intelligence is never going to be successful.\n\nmy artificial intelligence dream\n\nmany people may not know that i used to be an \"ai fanatic.\" i have also been crazy about artificial intelligence, and deemed it as my \"great ideal.\" i also used to comment on \"human beings\" at every turn, as if the machine can be compared with human beings, or even higher than human beings. when dark blue defeated kasparov, i once marveled: \"oh, comes the doom of us human beings!\" i also thought that once there are two magic weapons (oh, i'm joking. they're actually two slogans): \"logic\" and \"learning\", the machine will surpass human intelligence sooner or later. however, i did not figure out how this should be achieved, nor did i figure out the meanings for achieving this.\n\nthe story begins more than a decade ago when artificial intelligence was in its winter. at the library of tsinghua university, i stumbled upon a long-lost peter norvig's masterpiece, paradigms of artificial intelligence programming (paip). like an archaeologist, i began to ponder and implement the various classic ai algorithms. paip's algorithm focuses on logic and reasoning, because in its age, many ai researchers thought human intelligence, in the final analysis, is logical reasoning. they naively believe that with things like predicate logic, first-order logic, with abilities to express \"cause - result\", \"not only - but also\", what \"exists\", and what is \"for all\", the machines can have intelligence. so they designed a variety of logic-based algorithms, expert systems, and even designed the logic-based programming language prolog, calling it \"the fifth generation programming language.\" in the end, they encountered insurmountable obstacles. many ai companies could not achieve their boasted goals. various \"neuron-based\" machines could not solve practical problems. huge government and private investment were lost. artificial intelligence entered its winter.\n\ni met paip in that winter. although it didn't make me dedicated to the field of artificial intelligence, it made me fall in love with lisp and programming language. it is also because of this book that for the first time i implemented the a* and other algorithms easily and in a structured way, and understood the true meaning of them. also because of paip, i first understood what the \"modularity\" of a program is. i started using small \"-----> tool !!!  functions\" in my own program instead of worrying about the \"function call overhead\" that many people are worried about. the two books, paip and sicp, led me to devote to the field of programming languages and be fortunate enough to get the guidance of the originators in this field.\n\nafter paip, i was lost in machine learning for a while, because someone told me that machine learning is a new chapter in artificial intelligence. however, i gradually realized that the so-called artificial intelligence and machine learning have little to do with true human intelligence. as for the actual problems, the classic algorithm in paip is quite naive and complicated, and it is impossible to solve large-scale practical problems. the most important problem is that i don't see the algorithm in paip has anything to do with \"intelligent\". the term \"machine learning\" is completely nominal. as many people have found out, machine learning is, to be honest, just the \"fit function\" in statistics, replaced by a deceptive name.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": "('nan',)", "score": 0, "comments": 5, "media": "('nan',)", "medialink": "('https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/955ioc/translation_automatic_programming_is_impossible/',)", "identifyer": 5756501, "year": "2018"}, {"autor": "Ecsta-siEcsta-no", "date": 1542375394000, "content": "Google is making an \"AI-powered assistant for nurses and doctors\u201d /!/ This is more like it.

So I have tried to give you all the proof I have at this point. For me to show you the results Im getting, I would have to be able to tell you how much money is on all the tables of all the casinos in the world, and how much they are winning or losing in real time. This data, is the next part of the project, but the following will explain the first part. \n\nHello, friends. I would like to tell you a story to beat all stories. There once was a hobbit, who lived in a hole\u2026 and this is a retelling of a very old story, or allegory, as I hope you will contact us afterwards, of how he got out of the cave he made for himself. \n\nThe Plan\n\nWe are going to monopolize a series of decentralized crypto currency networks, more specifically utility token networks, that currently exist in a state of simultaneously being over valued, and under valued, at the same time. This result was not expected at the outset of the creation of the projects that we are going to explore, but I assure you, this is the case. It is very possible that we\u2019re looking at the cutting edge of computer science \u2013 potentially, we are looking at a rip in the space-time continuum \u2013 but what is most definite is that we\u2019re looking at an arbitrage opportunity of historic significance. It is also potentially going to be the largest robbery perpetrated against the most deserving victims, resulting in the most benefit for the most people since Robin Hood took Prince John\u2019s last shilling. \n\nWhat Im going to describe is a little bit classical investing, a little bit of The Matrix, and a little bit Oceans 11. Its also going to be a little bit Darwinist, a little bit Wolf of Wall Street, and very self-serving all the way to the end of it, where it becomes the most beautiful gift humanity ever gave to itself. But the good part, at the very end, only happens if we can trust each other to break an unbreakable trustless system. And after we\u2019re done doing that, we\u2019re going to have to do something that is even more unheard of in the study of history, and a thing commonly only found in fantasy. What we\u2019re going to try to create is the most similar to 9/11, in the sense that it is the opposite of it. Our data has found, through the study of human history, that a small group of people sufficiently funded with a relatively small sum of money are capable of taking that money, and turning it into a catalyst that results in a historic event that shapes the future for many years to come. The common term for this is a catastrophe, or cataclysmic event. \n\nBut the thesis of this computer science experiment that we\u2019re already undertaking, but seek the support of in reaching out to you, is that we can create the opposite of a catastrophe. The term for this was coined first by JRR Tolkien \u2013 he referred to this even as a \u201ceucatastrophe\u201d or a \u201ca sudden and favorable resolution of events in a story\u201d but perhaps is most commonly known to the public as \u201ca happy ending\u201d \u2013 he describes this event in the The Lord of the Rings, when Frodo drops the ring into Mount Doom. \n\nI believe it is possible to dream a happy ending into existence using computer logic and the greed of speculation about the future, rather than the real world investing in it that our market system was supposed to provide - but this is how the story begins.\n\nOrientation\n\nThe first crypto currency, Bitcoin, is only 8 years old, and at the end of this document, you will likely understand more about crypto currency than the people who created the first one. This is possible because it is an entire sector that has been more pushed forward by dreamers and curious minds than it has been developed by venture capital interests. \n\nGroups that demand immediate and consistent profitable returns, and measure those returns against the results of other ventures that have been agreed on to be the benchmark of success would suggest that double digit annual returns are unsustainable but its best to enjoy them while it lasts. But, we have found, using crypto currencies, that the returns traditional investing earn in a year can be gained in a day, when occupying enough market share of a market. We do this using automation to interact with the world markets in a specific way that provides liquidity and stability in markets that are traditionally the most volatile in the world. As the price moves, we tax that movement, and extract value for ourselves by way of profits from trading, and create value for the broader ecosystem in the form of price support, thus preventing the market from bottoming out (or at least falling slower because of our participation), as well as creating price stability during market highs, allowing people with non-automated trading systems to capitalize on longer periods of positive growth without missing the chance to sell while the market is up. \n\nWhile our automation has sufficient funds to provide liquidity in these exchanges, we are day over day getting between 100 and 300 bps/day in earnings. To continue providing liquidity to these markets when our own reserves of coins are low, we are using a decentralized smart contract that provides credit in exchange for collateral and interest on the resources lent. By using this method, we are able to keep liquidity in these markets, and our trading system maximally effective, regardless of price movement or our own holdings of coins, and the interest on renting the coins to do it is almost negligible. \n\nFurthermore, these markets are \u201cutility tokens\u201d exchanges. That is to say, these tokens only represent resources a computer network should allocate to a user based on the size of his coin holdings. There are no traditional metrics to evaluate these coins and their value, as the market price of them is simply the intersection of supply and demand on a moment to moment basis as determined by a decentralized network of users who have or want them. In short, they will never be so cheap that the price of the desk the computers sit on is greater than the price of owning a stake in that desk, because they do not represent ownership of that desk at all. Likewise, when the price is astronomically high, it can never be deemed too high, because the network it represents resource allocation of does not now, nor ever will be profitable or unprofitable. It simply will continue to be there, and allow you to interact with it, based on if you have coins for that network and how many. It is more important to understand that these coins are NOT SECURITIES than it is to understand what those coins are at all. \n\nGoing forward, a great deal of this plan and discussion will be metaphor and perhaps come across as hyperbole. The reason for this is because the systems that we are talking about are simply shuffling zeroes and ones to each other, and if I gave you the math for what is going to happen expressed in those terms, there are few or no minds on the planet that could follow the thread of this discussion in those terms at all in the context of how much data the network has if you tried to aggregate it. \n\nThe very people who create and code these networks do not even interact with them on these terms of zeroes and ones, but rather in a coding language. In this sense, even the people coding these systems are only using metaphor by interacting using the programming languages that they do. And so, in order to make this slightly less boring, and more readable, I hope you will forgive the use of language that is more descriptive than it is literal, but what is most important to remember along the way is that nothing about what is being described is a crime as the Security Exchange Commission would see it, because none of these things are securities at all. \n\nWhat is the Bitcoin Network? \n\nThe first bitcoin was created 8 years ago as a result of a cryptographic computer science experiment in which a group of people who referred to themselves as \u201cthe cryptopunks\u201d sought to create a decentralized and censorship resistant network that could keep a ledger of the location of all the bitcoins and their ownership in real time without the need for any 3rd party involvement or consent. \n\nThe entity attributed with the creation of Bitcoin, and the blockchain technology is known only as \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d which is commonly agreed to be a pseudonym for a person or group of persons. No one has heard from \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d since \u201che\u201d disappeared after a colleague on the Bitcoin team sent him an email saying that the CIA had reached out to him, and wanted to talk about their research. \n\nThe security of the blockchain is provided through \u201cproof of work\u201d in which a network of computers around the planet attempt to use brute for number crunching to find the sum of the interior angles of a triangle in non-Euclidean geometry based on 3 points on a sphere. The interior angle of that triangle are unpredictable, because unlike in traditional geometry where the sum of the angles is always 180 degrees, when 3 points on a triangle are placed on a sphere the range can fall anywhere above 180 degrees, but not equal to it, and as high as or equal to 540 degrees. To perhaps exemplify how a triangle can have 540 degrees, consider that if you and 2 friends formed a straight line on earth, that the interior angle between each of you is 180 degrees, and there are 3 of you, and the definition of a triangle is 3 points on any given plane, thus the angle of the triangle you formed when standing in a line is 540 degrees, and cannot be any greater. The interior angle of the previous block in the chain is the determining factor in the placement of the next 3 points to be solved for in the following. The first machine to solve the question of \u201cHow many degrees are inside this triangle?\u201d by guessing is given the privilege of taking the highest bidders for his time from the market, and performing the protocols desired by way of recording changes to the block chain, while other participants in the system are prevented from recording in this way. As the next block cannot be solved without knowing the solution to the present one, the system is trustless and immutable \u2013 it cannot be tampered with, and is governed only by math, with no gate keepers. \n\nWhat is the Ethereum Network?\n\nThe Ethereum Network, or Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a set of computer protocols with a heavy emphasis on determinism as the backbone it was built on. These protocols determine the outcome of an interaction with the blockchain, and the creation of an ever-evolving record of the location and allocation of the resources these systems are built to account for. \n\nEthereum also has the ability for users to interact and create decentralized \u201csmart contracts\u201d which serve to govern the ownership and allocation of coins as agreed upon by two parties based upon outcomes that don\u2019t require a 3rd party to execute. Metaphorically, you can think of this as an ATM, where no bank teller interacts with you, but rather a user only interacts with a machine that allows you to deposit money in your savings account, and borrow on a credit card with a limit proportional to your savings account. You could also think of it as a dooms-day device, that is going to act the way its going to act with no way to stop it once events are put in motion. \n\nOther users of the smart contract can see how you have interacted with it because the blockchain is public and visible to the world, and if they would like, can accept the terms of that agreement, and at no time can anyone other than each of the individual users control what the users are doing. In short, there are no gatekeepers in Ethereum. There is only what exists in the network by way of code, and the infinite room to put it there if you would like to and are willing to pay for the electricity needed to carve it into existence and be maintained for the rest of time, but this is a one time payment which costs less than your credit card skims from starbucks when you buy a coffee.\n\nWhat is staking? \n\nStaking is an idea seeking to resolve the problem of energy waste that is seen in proof of work. The problem with proof of work is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to run the level of computation that crypto networks currently use, and all but 1 of those computations actually resulted in change at all. To solve this problem, a staking system could be put in place in which rather than randomly guessing as we have been, a user would put up collateral in order to act as verification entity, where the trust of that individual\u2019s word was determined by how large of a stake that individual might have. Anyone who felt that the outcome of an event in the blockchain was being mis-reported could put a larger stake up or proportion thereof, and which ever outcome is the most heavily staked by the user base would be deemed the \u201ctrue\u201d outcome, because there is seemingly no value is attempting to stake a \u201clie\u201d or \u201cuntruth\u201d if a greater consensus could be made, as the economic incentive is to side with the truth than the lie. \n\nWhat is Augur? What is REP? \n\nAugur is a decentralized prediction market platform. The limits for what kind of market can be made is infinite, and censorship proof, as a result of being hosted on the Ethereum Network. Users stake their REP, short for Reputation, in order to report the resolution of market outcomes. Because Ethereum has no way of drawing information from the outside world without the outside world participating with it intentionally, this hurdle is overcome by allowing users to report themselves. In exchange for doing this reporting work, people who hold REP are given a small amount of the volume of those markets (as set by the market creators) and these dividends are paid in Ether (ETH). \n\nSo an example of what kind of market could be found within Augur is \u201cWho will win the game this weekend between the Eagles and Packers?\u201d or \u201cWho is going to win the next election?\u201d or \u201cWill the rainfall this year in Chicago exceed 22 inches?\u201d or even \u201cWhen will mankind cure death?\u201d. There is no approval process in creating a market, only a loose form users must stick to, and the resource requirements to maintain that market on the blockchain \u2013 again, infinitely, for the rest of time if desired, in exchange for a one time payment in the present to cover the cost of electricity to manifest your will or curiosity on the network. \n\nIn the time between the creation and resolution of these markets, users can see the likelihood of the outcome of any given result represented by the confidence in that result numerically using Ether and the volume staking one outcome or another. This type of prediction oracle is called \u201cThe wisdom of the crowd\u201d which says that it is more accurate to ask the crowd than any one person for their opinion of that outcome, as no one person has all the information on the system in question. \n\nComputer Science and the Space-Time Continuum \n\nWe live in an uncertain time. In the very real world we live in people in our country are arming themselves against their neighbors. Gun sales at record highs. Racial tension. What would happen if my band of pirates staked 1,000,000 ETH in a prediction market paying 100,000:1 that we will all love each other and not have a race war. Do you think people who could see that uncensorable prediction market would feel more at ease, and perhaps not buy a gun, or fear their neighbor less? Do you think if we were correct about that prediction market that we would have gotten lucky, or would we have believed our own prediction into existence and created a situation where we are not only staking the future, but creating it by using greed as the fuel? If a person thought in spite of my band of misfits prediction market that there still would be a race war this year, do you think that they would spend 1,000 dollars on an AR-15 to feel safer, or stake the opposite position with those funds in that market against my declaration of peace, and rather have the keys to a wallet that can be accessed anywhere in the world with 100,000,000 dollars to buy their safety if they are ever living in a world where a gun might help?\n\nConsidering that my band of misfits doesnt need the money, nearly so much as we need a better safer world, and will have created an incentive for you to feel safer, and not buy a gun either way - do you think the future that comes to be was lucky prediction? Or market manipulation?\n\nWould you rather have us manipulate that market? Or not?\n\nWhat do you think would happen in the tech industry if we took the position that the singularity was going to happen in 2029 or not going to happen in 2028, and we staked 1 billion dollars on it happening accordingly. We would have created an incentive in a futures market for someone to take the opposite side of our action, and try to do it faster. If the singularity happened in 2028 because we took so much stupid beanie baby money and proclaimed that it was going to happen in 2029 - what just happened there? Did the winner of that bet in our futures market get lucky? Or did we just create a mechanism for greed to accelerate the end of human mortality because we said it would happen with money by staking the position that it wouldnt? What do you think would happen if we staked the temperature of the earth with that money that nearly destroyed it? What would happen if we staked the race to mars, or the moon? What if your opportunity was that no one had gone to the moon yet this year, and we had created a way to profit by just going to check that its still there? We would have created a global decentralized market for the challenges that we face as a species, and opportunity to optimize ourselves without needing permission to be the best versions we can be. All of these markets can be crowd funded into eternity for visa\u2019s cut of your cup of coffee, and would grow infinitely from the failure of the previous moment in time until our disappointment and greed merge to collapse the infinite possibility of time and space, thus dreaming a better world into existence using man kind\u2019s propensity for greed, and proven track record of being disappointing. \n\nWe believe that this will potentially cause dramatic harm to the crypto economy, and broader economy as we know if for a short time. We believe our system is capable of growing the coins in our custody at a rate well above 1.5% per day, because we are currently growing at 3% per day. The power of exponential growth is significant. Likely, more than you can imagine. Consider than 1 dollar today will be 38 next year at 1% growth per day. It will be over 50 at 1.1%, and at 3% growth per day, 1 dollar becomes almost 50,000 in a year. This is the data that assures me that I don\u2019t really need your help, only would like it. Based on the coins in our custody now, and our present rate of growth and innovation, our projections put us at owning the bulk of coins in circulation in the next 19 years. But \u2013 if we were to push that timeline even a little bit, by increasing that pile of coins in the present, we accelerate the timeline exponentially. And if we increase the resources in our control by quite a bit\u2026 we believe that we will accomplish our goal in the next 2 years. \n\nThe Goal \n\nWhen our Computer Science Appreciation Club has accumulated enough of the coins in the network, and wrung every bit of value that exists only as a result of greed and speculation by those who have no desire to ever use these networks, we are going to do another magic trick. \n\nIn addition to accelerating human accomplishment with the power of hope, dreams, and greed. We\u2019re going to take all or some of the coins in our control, and we\u2019re going to collateralize them in a money market very much like the one we are currently using to impose our will on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. We are going to issue a new coin, backed by all the coins we had accumulated previously to create a stable, immutable, uncontrollable, uncensorable, globally available currency. Then, we\u2019re going to send the keys of an individual wallet address to every man woman and child on the planet with some of that coin in it. And we are going to put some more of that coin in it every day. So that at no point, will there be a day where someone can say they did not have two nickels to rub together. We believe no one will ever say they didn\u2019t have two hundred dollar bills together, when we are successful, ever again. \n\nBut this is not a selfless act by my merry band of misfits and pirates. Quite the contrary. We believe that nearly everyone on the planet that we interact with is disappointing. That the chimpanzee meat computer of our present hardware is ill suited to optimizing for the future in the present paradigm. We are giving away this money at that point, so that everyone can stop being such a disappointment to us. We are tired of the experience where an hourly employee gives us bad customer service because they are not paid enough to put up with our bullshit. We hope to make a world where people interact with each other because they want to, not because they have to. We are going to be filthy rich, when we are successful, or for that matter if we fail, my band of misfits. And we are worried when that happens about how long before it is that men with guns come for what is ours. We don\u2019t know if these men with guns will come from the governments of the world, or from those envying what we have. \n\nWe seek to become the golden goose of the planet, and in return we would like to not fear slaughter while we try this. In this arrangement, we look only for your cooperation, and in return, will share an infinite sum of golden eggs with you, and everyone you know. And when we do this, we will not fear the envy of our neighbors, nor the governments who command the armies it would take to stop us. We will protect the people from their governments, and themselves. And in time, we hope the governments will likewise protect us from their people, though letting go of power will no doubt be hard to swallow. The only thing that can stop us from doing this is if someone buys the coins that give us power from us. And in doing so, would give us the wealth we need to accomplish these things in the real world. If we are not bought out, we will accumulate enough coins in the Ethereum Network that we can impose our will upon it, until we can deliver on our promises of a better world because we control it completely. \n\nIn these sense, we have already won. A better world is already here, as certainly as we have already dreamed the path to it. We plan on out-staking a better world into existence, regardless of what the future currently holds in store for us now. In short, we are going to lie to an unbreakable trustless system until it births the world we\u2019re lying about into the realm of what is real. In shorter, we are going to believe our bullshit more than you cannot believe it, until we have delivered what we promised.\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe problem with growing as fast as the control our Computer Science Appreciation Club is over the Ethereum Network is that its too fast. We\u2019re growing our sum of coins so fast, that to an outside observer you might think we were a hedge fund of some sort at best. But at worst, you might think we were a criminal enterprise. Legitimate enterprises don\u2019t grow at 1% or more daily infinitely, but we do. And if you were not as educated as you are, now, at this point in reading this, when you saw how \u201crich\u201d we were, you might think someone should try to stop it. We would ask, for your sake, and our own, that you don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t need you to do anything, and the world is going to get better from here. \n\nThe problem is that if we were a hedge fund, which we aren\u2019t, then we would need to file paperwork to take control of other people\u2019s funds. If these were securities, the acts we were going to commit would be best exemplified in Wolf of Wall Street, but we\u2019re going to do it on a much greater scale with computers. Lucky for us, these coins are not securities, they are less regulated than the gold in World of Warcraft you can buy with your credit card, or the skins in League of Legends. These coins are worth nothing, and everything, at the same time. \n\nBut the bigger problem, is that I cannot stop you from sending \u201cmoney\u201d to my \u201chedge fund\u201d when/if you sent ether to my wallet address where we are running this experiment. It\u2019s a decentralized system, and its open source, and completely public, if we tried to hide it would only work for so long until an internet detective found it. If someone was to find the address of our computer science appreciation club, we could not stop them from sending coins there. But, since we cannot stop them, we would like them not to waste their time looking \u2013 the address is this on the Ethereum Network: \n\n0xCDF449b5c9Bd2A725319163C3E7f2d7222c4d8c9 \n\nWe have the best legal minds on the planet trying to solve this puzzle with us, and we\u2019ll get the paperwork straight soon \u2013 if the Winklevoss Twins don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conflict of interest. \n\nIf reading this letter, you find your brain to be so tickled by it - that regardless of the forces that seek to keep us from accumulating enough resources to do this in two years, you wish to believe in it more than those opposing forces, and in doing so stake your opinion about what the future you are going to live will be, I would not ask you to waste a moment of your life looking for us, because we are here to be found. We cannot count our coins as fast as they grow, but our collective efforts will be carved into the eternal stone of the Ethereum network, and I promise we\u2019re going to give back all of these coins to the world, when we\u2019re done fixing a few things. \n\nBut there is another problem, and its far worse than making \u201cmoney\u201d too fast - just as we are going to bet that no one goes to the moon until someone does every year forever just for fun, it is possible to bet on the absence of a war until a war exists because your certainty manifests it into being to spite you. The same market we hope to keep the world at peace, and put their fears to rest from the uncertainty of where we\u2019re going next is also a mechanism to game our system, and bet on a war happening to get rich. But there is a way to stop this \u2013 we\u2019re going to accumulate the majority of the REP tokens, and if we have 51% of the circulation, if someone tries to beat us at our own game and bring a war into existence \u2013 then we would be able to stop the unstoppable machine from making them rich. We will also have the wallet addresses of the people who needed the insurance policy we are going to unfairly deny, to make them whole, and they would have neighbors with means to support them while we unfucked the pooch. We would have a failsafe to prevent a war from coming to be, because we are so sure there will not be one that it might happen. This, above all else, will back the new currency we are going to issue to the planet. Our new currency will not be backed by gold, or equity, or faith in a flawed system. It we be backed by trust of mankind invested back into itself that we will not go back to a system that will tolerate scarcity, or war, or hunger in exchange for the certainty of the absence of these things. No one will need to ask what is in our vault, or need to audit it, until the day comes where maybe someone will try to beat us at our own game. If that happens \u2013 we\u2019re going to need the world to give back the currency we gave it as our collective reward for our cooperation, to free the tool we need to stop violent men from becoming rich men at the cost of a world without poverty, because it will be the immutable collateral backing the currency we are going to give you. \n\nAs a disclaimer, Im not somebody who has the background you might think someone should have for this \u2013 Im just a hobbit. Im not a hedge fund manager, or a computer science engineer. I raise pigs, and ducks, and geese that need some help, too \u2013 because we aren\u2019t eating them enough to keep them existing in our food supply. It is a more fun paradox than this, and I get to solve that one by cooking dinner for some friends, and telling stories when this adventure is over. It feels a little like The Shire there, where I\u2019ve been hiding melting my ego with psychedelics in the sunshine while salting pork, and listening to podcasts from Rogan, Duncan, Bart Chystler, Tom and Krista, some tinfoil hat guys, and seeing how abundant a life can be given only a little bit of hopium and room for creativity, and Im eager to get there and back, again. I very much look forward to seeing what we\u2019re all capable of, when we\u2019re given a chance. But we\u2019re going to have to put a little faith in a system that doesn\u2019t need faith to operate - so that we can fix a different system that has never needed it more. I think we\u2019re going to be able to do that for us all, but I might very well be lying to you, and not know it yet \u2013 at least, that\u2019s the plan. \n\nIronically, salting pork is what brought me to understand what is worth something, and what isn\u2019t. When they used to talk about a \u201csalary\u201d or say that you were \u201cworth your salt\u201d was because all that you needed to live was enough salt to keep your meat from rotting when you cured it into bacon and hams at the end of the season. The salt\u2019s value wasn\u2019t while it was in the bag, it was while it was preserving your food when times were hard and things were scarce. In the modern time, a salary is what gets bigger when a emloyer make his employees poorer. Now, we have made laws to respect each other by race and religion and where who-sticks-what-where, but made it legal and standard to reduce someone\u2019s value to an integer value of currency per moment in time, and the currency is backed by oppression of man-against-man (chicks, too). To increase your integer value per moment in time, that gain must come from another? Are we the only people who think this is inherently disrespectful to your fellow man even if you don\u2019t call him a \u201cfag\u201d to his face like we used to when we were kids and it meant \u201cI love you, man \u2013 but Im too afraid of being called gay to say it\u201d. \n\nIn the present what is perhaps the most scarce of all, are places where you are free to be an animal at all, let alone places where you are free to be the lion you might be and not know it. We are so caught up in having agreed upon contracts so that we don\u2019t get fucked, that we don\u2019t have trust or honor that is held between lions when the zebra meat is abundant and they eat shoulder to shoulder without worry of each other. We live in a time where there is quite literally more deer on the planet than there has been in some time, and yet we imagine something would keep us as lions from preying on them in the real world. But, to us, as long as you are giving the animals fair chase, there is no time that feeding yourself as the king of the jungle is wrong, if you are hungry. And Im here to tell the people who think they can stop us, that we are giving you fair chase. We will be in every exchange on the planet soon, giving you chances to get on or off this train. And when you buy, it will be from us. When you sell, it will be to us. Your only safe market is the door out of here in ETH/USD and BTC/USD because we will not be selling our coins, only buying more. And every time you do anything other than leave your coins on the table, and take that worthless paper money with you, we will grow that much stronger. If you buy the coins we want, you will give us power in the real world. If you sell them, we will get them cheaper. When your fear or FOMO has sent you zigging\u2026 or for that matter zagging, one of my lions will catch you. We are not asking for your support by way of co-operation, we are asking for it by absence of resistance from a better world than this one. If you will not give us your coins, then we ask that you do not trade them. Keep the keys, or burn them and count them as your contribution without us knowing my band of pirates owes you a favor. Our only compromise is to remove them from circulation, as in this decentralized system, that is the only place we cannot reach them. But co-operation will get us there far, far sooner. To quote a most wise computer scientist, \u201cResistance is futile, you will be assimilated.\u201d We have re-programmed the Kobayashi Maru. My fellowship and I have set out for Mount Doom. And you will be skeptical of us, all the way until you aren\u2019t. And then, I would ask for only your belief \u2013 perhaps in no one more then yourselves, that you could be the type of person to rise to a challenge that will face us that we haven\u2019t seen yet. But maybe you can rise to face t", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/9qtnum/if_there_is_anywhere_that_i_can_post_this_and_not/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "singularity",

full of scammers. so i have tried to give you all the proof i have at this point. for me to show you the results im getting, i would have to be able to tell you how much money is on all the tables of all the casinos in the world, and how much they are winning or losing in real time. this data, is the next part of the project, but the following will explain the first part. \n\nhello, friends. i would like to tell you a story to beat all stories. there once was a hobbit, who lived in a hole\u2026 and this is a retelling of a very old story, or allegory, as i hope you will contact us afterwards, of how he got out of the cave he made for himself. \n\nthe plan\n\nwe are going to monopolize a series of decentralized crypto currency networks, more specifically utility token networks, that currently exist in a state of simultaneously being over valued, and under valued, at the same time. this result was not expected at the outset of the creation of the projects that we are going to explore, but i assure you, this is the case. it is very possible that we\u2019re looking at the cutting edge of computer science \u2013 potentially, we are looking at a rip in the space-time continuum \u2013 but what is most definite is that we\u2019re looking at an arbitrage opportunity of historic significance. it is also potentially going to be the largest robbery perpetrated against the most deserving victims, resulting in the most benefit for the most people since robin hood took prince john\u2019s last shilling. \n\nwhat im going to describe is a little bit classical investing, a little bit of the matrix, and a little bit oceans 11. its also going to be a little bit darwinist, a little bit wolf of wall street, and very self-serving all the way to the end of it, where it becomes the most beautiful gift humanity ever gave to itself. but the good part, at the very end, only happens if we can trust each other to break an unbreakable trustless system. and after we\u2019re done doing that, we\u2019re going to have to do something that is even more unheard of in the study of history, and a thing commonly only found in fantasy. what we\u2019re going to try to create is the most similar to 9/11, in the sense that it is the opposite of it. our data has found, through the study of human history, that a small group of people sufficiently funded with a relatively small sum of money are capable of taking that money, and turning it into a catalyst that results in a historic event that shapes the future for many years to come. the common term for this is a catastrophe, or cataclysmic event. \n\nbut the thesis of this computer science experiment that we\u2019re already undertaking, but seek the support of in reaching out to you, is that we can create the opposite of a catastrophe. the term for this was coined first by jrr tolkien \u2013 he referred to this even as a \u201ceucatastrophe\u201d or a \u201ca sudden and favorable resolution of events in a story\u201d but perhaps is most commonly known to the public as \u201ca happy ending\u201d \u2013 he describes this event in the the lord of the rings, when frodo drops the ring into mount doom. \n\ni believe it is possible to dream a happy ending into existence using computer logic and the greed of speculation about the future, rather than the real world investing in it that our market system was supposed to provide - but this is how the story begins.\n\norientation\n\nthe first crypto currency, bitcoin, is only 8 years old, and at the end of this document, you will likely understand more about crypto currency than the people who created the first one. this is possible because it is an entire sector that has been more pushed forward by dreamers and curious minds than it has been developed by venture capital interests. \n\ngroups that demand immediate and consistent profitable returns, and measure those returns against the results of other ventures that have been agreed on to be the benchmark of success would suggest that double digit annual returns are unsustainable but its best to enjoy them while it lasts. but, we have found, using crypto currencies, that the returns traditional investing earn in a year can be gained in a day, when occupying enough market share of a market. we do this using automation to interact with the world markets in a specific way that provides liquidity and stability in markets that are traditionally the most volatile in the world. as the price moves, we tax that movement, and extract value for ourselves by way of profits from trading, and create value for the broader ecosystem in the form of price support, thus preventing the market from bottoming out (or at least falling slower because of our participation), as well as creating price stability during market highs, allowing people with non-automated trading systems to capitalize on longer periods of positive growth without missing the chance to sell while the market is up. \n\nwhile our automation has sufficient funds to provide liquidity in these exchanges, we are day over day getting between 100 and 300 bps/day in earnings. to continue providing liquidity to these markets when our own reserves of coins are low, we are using a decentralized smart contract that provides credit in exchange for collateral and interest on the resources lent. by using this method, we are able to keep liquidity in these markets, and our trading system maximally effective, regardless of price movement or our own holdings of coins, and the interest on renting the coins to do it is almost negligible. \n\nfurthermore, these markets are \u201cutility tokens\u201d exchanges. that is to say, these tokens only represent resources a computer network should allocate to a user based on the size of his coin holdings. there are no traditional metrics to evaluate these coins and their value, as the market price of them is simply the intersection of supply and demand on a moment to moment basis as determined by a decentralized network of users who have or want them. in short, they will never be so cheap that the price of the desk the computers sit on is greater than the price of owning a stake in that desk, because they do not represent ownership of that desk at all. likewise, when the price is astronomically high, it can never be deemed too high, because the network it represents resource allocation of does not now, nor ever will be profitable or unprofitable. it simply will continue to be there, and allow you to interact with it, based on if you have coins for that network and how many. it is more important to understand that these coins are not securities than it is to understand what those coins are at all. \n\ngoing forward, a great deal of this plan and discussion will be metaphor and perhaps come across as hyperbole. the reason for this is because the systems that we are talking about are simply shuffling zeroes and ones to each other, and if i gave you the math for what is going to happen expressed in those terms, there are few or no minds on the planet that could follow the thread of this discussion in those terms at all in the context of how much data the network has if you tried to aggregate it. \n\nthe very people who create and code these networks do not even interact with them on these terms of zeroes and ones, but rather in a coding language. in this sense, even the people coding these systems are only using metaphor by interacting using the programming languages that they do. and so, in order to make this slightly less boring, and more readable, i hope you will forgive the use of language that is more descriptive than it is literal, but what is most important to remember along the way is that nothing about what is being described is a crime as the security exchange commission would see it, because none of these things are securities at all. \n\nwhat is the bitcoin network? \n\nthe first bitcoin was created 8 years ago as a result of a cryptographic computer science experiment in which a group of people who referred to themselves as \u201cthe cryptopunks\u201d sought to create a decentralized and censorship resistant network that could keep a ledger of the location of all the bitcoins and their ownership in real time without the need for any 3rd party involvement or consent. \n\nthe entity attributed with the creation of bitcoin, and the blockchain technology is known only as \u201csatoshi nakamoto\u201d which is commonly agreed to be a pseudonym for a person or group of persons. no one has heard from \u201csatoshi nakamoto\u201d since \u201che\u201d disappeared after a colleague on the bitcoin team sent him an email saying that the cia had reached out to him, and wanted to talk about their research. \n\nthe security of the blockchain is provided through \u201cproof of work\u201d in which a network of computers around the planet attempt to use brute for number crunching to find the sum of the interior angles of a triangle in non-euclidean geometry based on 3 points on a sphere. the interior angle of that triangle are unpredictable, because unlike in traditional geometry where the sum of the angles is always 180 degrees, when 3 points on a triangle are placed on a sphere the range can fall anywhere above 180 degrees, but not equal to it, and as high as or equal to 540 degrees. to perhaps exemplify how a triangle can have 540 degrees, consider that if you and 2 friends formed a straight line on earth, that the interior angle between each of you is 180 degrees, and there are 3 of you, and the definition of a triangle is 3 points on any given plane, thus the angle of the triangle you formed when standing in a line is 540 degrees, and cannot be any greater. the interior angle of the previous block in the chain is the determining factor in the placement of the next 3 points to be solved for in the following. the first machine to solve the question of \u201chow many degrees are inside this triangle?\u201d by guessing is given the privilege of taking the highest bidders for his time from the market, and performing the protocols desired by way of recording changes to the block chain, while other participants in the system are prevented from recording in this way. as the next block cannot be solved without knowing the solution to the present one, the system is trustless and immutable \u2013 it cannot be tampered with, and is governed only by math, with no gate keepers. \n\nwhat is the ethereum network?\n\nthe ethereum network, or ethereum virtual machine, is a set of computer protocols with a heavy emphasis on determinism as the backbone it was built on. these protocols determine the outcome of an interaction with the blockchain, and the creation of an ever-evolving record of the location and allocation of the resources these systems are built to account for. \n\nethereum also has the ability for users to interact and create decentralized \u201csmart contracts\u201d which serve to govern the ownership and allocation of coins as agreed upon by two parties based upon outcomes that don\u2019t require a 3rd party to execute. metaphorically, you can think of this as an atm, where no bank teller interacts with you, but rather a user only interacts with a machine that allows you to deposit money in your savings account, and borrow on a credit card with a limit proportional to your savings account. you could also think of it as a dooms-day device, that is going to act the way its going to act with no way to stop it once events are put in motion. \n\nother users of the smart contract can see how you have interacted with it because the blockchain is public and visible to the world, and if they would like, can accept the terms of that agreement, and at no time can anyone other than each of the individual users control what the users are doing. in short, there are no gatekeepers in ethereum. there is only what exists in the network by way of code, and the infinite room to put it there if you would like to and are willing to pay for the electricity needed to carve it into existence and be maintained for the rest of time, but this is a one time payment which costs less than your credit card skims from starbucks when you buy a coffee.\n\nwhat is staking? \n\nstaking is an idea seeking to resolve the problem of energy waste that is seen in proof of work. the problem with proof of work is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to run the level of computation that crypto networks currently use, and all but 1 of those computations actually resulted in change at all. to solve this problem, a staking system could be put in place in which rather than randomly guessing as we have been, a user would put up collateral in order to act as verification entity, where the trust of that individual\u2019s word was determined by how large of a stake that individual might have. anyone who felt that the outcome of an event in the blockchain was being mis-reported could put a larger stake up or proportion thereof, and which ever outcome is the most heavily staked by the user base would be deemed the \u201ctrue\u201d outcome, because there is seemingly no value is attempting to stake a \u201clie\u201d or \u201cuntruth\u201d if a greater consensus could be made, as the economic incentive is to side with the truth than the lie. \n\nwhat is augur? what is rep? \n\naugur is a decentralized prediction market platform. the limits for what kind of market can be made is infinite, and censorship proof, as a result of being hosted on the ethereum network. users stake their rep, short for reputation, in order to report the resolution of market outcomes. because ethereum has no way of drawing information from the outside world without the outside world participating with it intentionally, this hurdle is overcome by allowing users to report themselves. in exchange for doing this reporting work, people who hold rep are given a small amount of the volume of those markets (as set by the market creators) and these dividends are paid in ether (eth). \n\nso an example of what kind of market could be found within augur is \u201cwho will win the game this weekend between the eagles and packers?\u201d or \u201cwho is going to win the next election?\u201d or \u201cwill the rainfall this year in chicago exceed 22 inches?\u201d or even \u201cwhen will mankind cure death?\u201d. there is no approval process in creating a market, only a loose form users must stick to, and the resource requirements to maintain that market on the blockchain \u2013 again, infinitely, for the rest of time if desired, in exchange for a one time payment in the present to cover the cost of electricity to manifest your will or curiosity on the network. \n\nin the time between the creation and resolution of these markets, users can see the likelihood of the outcome of any given result represented by the confidence in that result numerically using ether and the volume staking one outcome or another. this type of prediction oracle is called \u201cthe wisdom of the crowd\u201d which says that it is more accurate to ask the crowd than any one person for their opinion of that outcome, as no one person has all the information on the system in question. \n\ncomputer science and the space-time continuum \n\nwe live in an uncertain time. in the very real world we live in people in our country are arming themselves against their neighbors. gun sales at record highs. racial tension. what would happen if my band of pirates staked 1,000,000 eth in a prediction market paying 100,000:1 that we will all love each other and not have a race war. do you think people who could see that uncensorable prediction market would feel more at ease, and perhaps not buy a gun, or fear their neighbor less? do you think if we were correct about that prediction market that we would have gotten lucky, or would we have believed our own prediction into existence and created a situation where we are not only staking the future, but creating it by using greed as the fuel? if a person thought in spite of my band of misfits prediction market that there still would be a race war this year, do you think that they would spend 1,000 dollars on an ar-15 to feel safer, or stake the opposite position with those funds in that market against my declaration of peace, and rather have the keys to a wallet that can be accessed anywhere in the world with 100,000,000 dollars to buy their safety if they are ever living in a world where a gun might help?\n\nconsidering that my band of misfits doesnt need the money, nearly so much as we need a better safer world, and will have created an incentive for you to feel safer, and not buy a gun either way - do you think the future that comes to be was lucky prediction? or market manipulation?\n\nwould you rather have us manipulate that market? or not?\n\nwhat do you think would happen in the tech industry if we took the position that the singularity was going to happen in 2029 or not going to happen in 2028, and we staked 1 billion dollars on it happening accordingly. we would have created an incentive in a futures market for someone to take the opposite side of our action, and try to do it faster. if the singularity happened in 2028 because we took so much stupid beanie baby money and proclaimed that it was going to happen in 2029 - what just happened there? did the winner of that bet in our futures market get lucky? or did we just create a mechanism for greed to accelerate the end of human mortality because we said it would happen with money by staking the position that it wouldnt? what do you think would happen if we staked the temperature of the earth with that money that nearly destroyed it? what would happen if we staked the race to mars, or the moon? what if your opportunity was that no one had gone to the moon yet this year, and we had created a way to profit by just going to check that its still there? we would have created a global decentralized market for the challenges that we face as a species, and opportunity to optimize ourselves without needing permission to be the best versions we can be. all of these markets can be crowd funded into eternity for visa\u2019s cut of your cup of coffee, and would grow infinitely from the failure of the previous moment in time until our disappointment and greed merge to collapse the infinite possibility of time and space, thus dreaming a better world into existence using man kind\u2019s propensity for greed, and proven track record of being disappointing. \n\nwe believe that this will potentially cause dramatic harm to the crypto economy, and broader economy as we know if for a short time. we believe our system is capable of growing the coins in our custody at a rate well above 1.5% per day, because we are currently growing at 3% per day. the power of exponential growth is significant. likely, more than you can imagine. consider than 1 dollar today will be 38 next year at 1% growth per day. it will be over 50 at 1.1%, and at 3% growth per day, 1 dollar becomes almost 50,000 in a year. this is the data that assures me that i don\u2019t really need your help, only would like it. based on the coins in our custody now, and our present rate of growth and innovation, our projections put us at owning the bulk of coins in circulation in the next 19 years. but \u2013 if we were to push that timeline even a little bit, by increasing that pile of coins in the present, we accelerate the timeline exponentially. and if we increase the resources in our control by quite a bit\u2026 we believe that we will accomplish our goal in the next 2 years. \n\nthe goal \n\nwhen our computer science appreciation club has accumulated enough of the coins in the network, and wrung every bit of value that exists only as a result of greed and speculation by those who have no desire to ever use these networks, we are going to do another magic trick. \n\nin addition to accelerating human accomplishment with the power of hope, dreams, and greed. we\u2019re going to take all or some of the coins in our control, and we\u2019re going to collateralize them in a money market very much like the one we are currently using to impose our will on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. we are going to issue a new coin, backed by all the coins we had accumulated previously to create a stable, immutable, uncontrollable, uncensorable, globally available currency. then, we\u2019re going to send the keys of an individual wallet address to every man woman and child on the planet with some of that coin in it. and we are going to put some more of that coin in it every day. so that at no point, will there be a day where someone can say they did not have two nickels to rub together. we believe no one will ever say they didn\u2019t have two hundred dollar bills together, when we are successful, ever again. \n\nbut this is not a selfless act by my merry band of misfits and pirates. quite the contrary. we believe that nearly everyone on the planet that we interact with is disappointing. that the chimpanzee meat computer of our present hardware is ill suited to optimizing for the future in the present paradigm. we are giving away this money at that point, so that everyone can stop being such a disappointment to us. we are tired of the experience where an hourly employee gives us bad customer service because they are not paid enough to put up with our bullshit. we hope to make a world where people interact with each other because they want to, not because they have to. we are going to be filthy rich, when we are successful, or for that matter if we fail, my band of misfits. and we are worried when that happens about how long before it is that men with guns come for what is ours. we don\u2019t know if these men with guns will come from the governments of the world, or from those envying what we have. \n\nwe seek to become the golden goose of the planet, and in return we would like to not fear slaughter while we try this. in this arrangement, we look only for your cooperation, and in return, will share an infinite sum of golden eggs with you, and everyone you know. and when we do this, we will not fear the envy of our neighbors, nor the governments who command the armies it would take to stop us. we will protect the people from their governments, and themselves. and in time, we hope the governments will likewise protect us from their people, though letting go of power will no doubt be hard to swallow. the only thing that can stop us from doing this is if someone buys the coins that give us power from us. and in doing so, would give us the wealth we need to accomplish these things in the real world. if we are not bought out, we will accumulate enough coins in the ethereum network that we can impose our will upon it, until we can deliver on our promises of a better world because we control it completely. \n\nin these sense, we have already won. a better world is already here, as certainly as we have already dreamed the path to it. we plan on out-staking a better world into existence, regardless of what the future currently holds in store for us now. in short, we are going to lie to an unbreakable trustless system until it births the world we\u2019re lying about into the realm of what is real. in shorter, we are going to believe our bullshit more than you cannot believe it, until we have delivered what we promised.\n\nthe problem\n\nthe problem with growing as fast as the control our computer science appreciation club is over the ethereum network is that its too fast. we\u2019re growing our sum of coins so fast, that to an outside observer you might think we were a hedge fund of some sort at best. but at worst, you might think we were a criminal enterprise. legitimate enterprises don\u2019t grow at 1% or more daily infinitely, but we do. and if you were not as educated as you are, now, at this point in reading this, when you saw how \u201crich\u201d we were, you might think someone should try to stop it. we would ask, for your sake, and our own, that you don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t need you to do anything, and the world is going to get better from here. \n\nthe problem is that if we were a hedge fund, which we aren\u2019t, then we would need to file paperwork to take control of other people\u2019s funds. if these were securities, the acts we were going to commit would be best exemplified in wolf of wall street, but we\u2019re going to do it on a much greater scale with computers. lucky for us, these coins are not securities, they are less regulated than the gold in world of warcraft you can buy with your credit card, or the skins in league of legends. these coins are worth nothing, and everything, at the same time. \n\nbut the bigger problem, is that i cannot stop you from sending \u201cmoney\u201d to my \u201chedge fund\u201d when/if you sent ether to my wallet address where we are running this experiment. it\u2019s a decentralized system, and its open source, and completely public, if we tried to hide it would only work for so long until an internet detective found it. if someone was to find the address of our computer science appreciation club, we could not stop them from sending coins there. but, since we cannot stop them, we would like them not to waste their time looking \u2013 the address is this on the ethereum network: \n\n0xcdf449b5c9bd2a725319163c3e7f2d7222c4d8c9 \n\nwe have the best legal minds on the planet trying to solve this puzzle with us, and we\u2019ll get the paperwork straight soon \u2013 if the winklevoss twins don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conflict of interest. \n\nif reading this letter, you find your brain to be so tickled by it - that regardless of the forces that seek to keep us from accumulating enough resources to do this in two years, you wish to believe in it more than those opposing forces, and in doing so stake your opinion about what the future you are going to live will be, i would not ask you to waste a moment of your life looking for us, because we are here to be found. we cannot count our coins as fast as they grow, but our collective efforts will be carved into the eternal stone of the ethereum network, and i promise we\u2019re going to give back all of these coins to the world, when we\u2019re done fixing a few things. \n\nbut there is another problem, and its far worse than making \u201cmoney\u201d too fast - just as we are going to bet that no one goes to the moon until someone does every year forever just for fun, it is possible to bet on the absence of a war until a war exists because your certainty manifests it into being to spite you. the same market we hope to keep the world at peace, and put their fears to rest from the uncertainty of where we\u2019re going next is also a mechanism to game our system, and bet on a war happening to get rich. but there is a way to stop this \u2013 we\u2019re going to accumulate the majority of the rep tokens, and if we have 51% of the circulation, if someone tries to beat us at our own game and bring a war into existence \u2013 then we would be able to stop the unstoppable machine from making them rich. we will also have the wallet addresses of the people who needed the insurance policy we are going to unfairly deny, to make them whole, and they would have neighbors with means to support them while we unfucked the pooch. we would have a failsafe to prevent a war from coming to be, because we are so sure there will not be one that it might happen. this, above all else, will back the new currency we are going to issue to the planet. our new currency will not be backed by gold, or equity, or faith in a flawed system. it we be backed by trust of mankind invested back into itself that we will not go back to a system that will tolerate scarcity, or war, or hunger in exchange for the certainty of the absence of these things. no one will need to ask what is in our vault, or need to audit it, until the day comes where maybe someone will try to beat us at our own game. if that happens \u2013 we\u2019re going to need the world to give back the currency we gave it as our collective reward for our cooperation, to free the -----> tool !!!  we need to stop violent men from becoming rich men at the cost of a world without poverty, because it will be the immutable collateral backing the currency we are going to give you. \n\nas a disclaimer, im not somebody who has the background you might think someone should have for this \u2013 im just a hobbit. im not a hedge fund manager, or a computer science engineer. i raise pigs, and ducks, and geese that need some help, too \u2013 because we aren\u2019t eating them enough to keep them existing in our food supply. it is a more fun paradox than this, and i get to solve that one by cooking dinner for some friends, and telling stories when this adventure is over. it feels a little like the shire there, where i\u2019ve been hiding melting my ego with psychedelics in the sunshine while salting pork, and listening to podcasts from rogan, duncan, bart chystler, tom and krista, some tinfoil hat guys, and seeing how abundant a life can be given only a little bit of hopium and room for creativity, and im eager to get there and back, again. i very much look forward to seeing what we\u2019re all capable of, when we\u2019re given a chance. but we\u2019re going to have to put a little faith in a system that doesn\u2019t need faith to operate - so that we can fix a different system that has never needed it more. i think we\u2019re going to be able to do that for us all, but i might very well be lying to you, and not know it yet \u2013 at least, that\u2019s the plan. \n\nironically, salting pork is what brought me to understand what is worth something, and what isn\u2019t. when they used to talk about a \u201csalary\u201d or say that you were \u201cworth your salt\u201d was because all that you needed to live was enough salt to keep your meat from rotting when you cured it into bacon and hams at the end of the season. the salt\u2019s value wasn\u2019t while it was in the bag, it was while it was preserving your food when times were hard and things were scarce. in the modern time, a salary is what gets bigger when a emloyer make his employees poorer. now, we have made laws to respect each other by race and religion and where who-sticks-what-where, but made it legal and standard to reduce someone\u2019s value to an integer value of currency per moment in time, and the currency is backed by oppression of man-against-man (chicks, too). to increase your integer value per moment in time, that gain must come from another? are we the only people who think this is inherently disrespectful to your fellow man even if you don\u2019t call him a \u201cfag\u201d to his face like we used to when we were kids and it meant \u201ci love you, man \u2013 but im too afraid of being called gay to say it\u201d. \n\nin the present what is perhaps the most scarce of all, are places where you are free to be an animal at all, let alone places where you are free to be the lion you might be and not know it. we are so caught up in having agreed upon contracts so that we don\u2019t get fucked, that we don\u2019t have trust or honor that is held between lions when the zebra meat is abundant and they eat shoulder to shoulder without worry of each other. we live in a time where there is quite literally more deer on the planet than there has been in some time, and yet we imagine something would keep us as lions from preying on them in the real world. but, to us, as long as you are giving the animals fair chase, there is no time that feeding yourself as the king of the jungle is wrong, if you are hungry. and im here to tell the people who think they can stop us, that we are giving you fair chase. we will be in every exchange on the planet soon, giving you chances to get on or off this train. and when you buy, it will be from us. when you sell, it will be to us. your only safe market is the door out of here in eth/usd and btc/usd because we will not be selling our coins, only buying more. and every time you do anything other than leave your coins on the table, and take that worthless paper money with you, we will grow that much stronger. if you buy the coins we want, you will give us power in the real world. if you sell them, we will get them cheaper. when your fear or fomo has sent you zigging\u2026 or for that matter zagging, one of my lions will catch you. we are not asking for your support by way of co-operation, we are asking for it by absence of resistance from a better world than this one. if you will not give us your coins, then we ask that you do not trade them. keep the keys, or burn them and count them as your contribution without us knowing my band of pirates owes you a favor. our only compromise is to remove them from circulation, as in this decentralized system, that is the only place we cannot reach them. but co-operation will get us there far, far sooner. to quote a most wise computer scientist, \u201cresistance is futile, you will be assimilated.\u201d we have re-programmed the kobayashi maru. my fellowship and i have set out for mount doom. and you will be skeptical of us, all the way until you aren\u2019t. and then, i would ask for only your belief \u2013 perhaps in no one more then yourselves, that you could be the type of person to rise to a challenge that will face us that we haven\u2019t seen yet. but maybe you can rise
