Companies hold more political power than any individual, many governments do not serve the people in any meaningful way, and autocracies are even committing open cultural genocide with no repercussions.\n\nWhen we throw in AGI (artificial general intelligence) and ASI (artificial super intelligence) into the mix, it is tempting therefore to believe that this is going to result in an exponential or instantaneous decline in the validity of democratic systems as such entities rapidly mobilize their superior intellect to seize power in way that we not only haven\u2019t thought of, but can\u2019t think of, in incredibly short time frames.\n\n# How can this view be challenged?\n\nI would challenge this view from a very fundamental and purely theoretical level. The first thing we need to consider is the connection between authority and water access. It is well-documented in sociology that autocracies tend to form wherever water is scarce and irrigation is needed. The prevailing theory is that these regions require huge investment and man power in order to be livable, and this creates a feedback loop where only a few wealthy individuals can control all of the water and therefore food supply, resulting in only these wealthy individuals getting wealthier allowing them to irrigate more. If you have read the Dune novels, you will know that this idea is a fundamental concept explored within the books. Democracies tend to form where water is plentiful or where crops are rain fed. This creates a scenario where no one person can gain a monopoly and it becomes more practical for these people to cooperate and specialize, resulting in the formation of democracies, federations, and republics.\n\n[https://www.economics.gu.se/digitalAssets/1373/1373644\\_bentzen.pdf](https://www.economics.gu.se/digitalAssets/1373/1373644_bentzen.pdf) \n\n# Why is all of this relevant?\n\nWe can see in modern times that a similar phenomenon has occurred with the accumulation of capital into the hands of a few super rich billionaires. There is a requirement for large initial investment followed by prolonged periods of zero-sum competition cumulating in monopoly. The political fallout is disastrous if you live in a democratic nation. Alternatively, if the economic system prevents the formation of monopolies, or distributes wealth more evenly, everyone ends up freer and the society more democratic. This is one of the reasons that solar panels are covertly a powerful tool for democracy, because even though some ultra-rich individuals could buy up a lot of land and install solar and battery  farms, if enough people are getting their own power from their roof, the big guy takes a serious handicap.\n\n# Alright, but what\u2019s this got to do with ASI? This shouldn\u2019t matter if we have a fast takeoff scenario which results in a single ASI.\n\nWhile it is true that a fast-takeoff scenario would probably result in a destroyed world where only a single entity exists, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen like this if all the computing power is in may people\u2019s hands. If we sit back and just accept that ASI will devour everything we know and love just days after it comes online, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, just like with energy production there is a way out. If such systems, even limited ones that are nowhere near as powerful as the type that nation states and large multi-national corporations might wield can still be a collective obstacle to any domination plans of god-like AI. While a single company like Google or Baidu could house an intellect that has many millions of times the collective intelligence of every human who ever lived, enough lonely morons living in their mom\u2019s basement might ruin it by setting up modified AGI's that acts as online service agents and runs at or below energy cost. (solar helps) The end result is that there would be less intelligence-based stratification in our world, paving the way for a free and prosperous future. The more diversity and distribution, the better. The key here of course, is that computing power can be relatively cheap, meaning that it doesn\u2019t require a huge start up cost ($2,000 could buy you an AGI laptop in a few decades) so it is like rain fed crops in the water analogy.\n\n# How exactly would that work out?\n\nLet\u2019s take a standard ASI takeover scenario. Some researchers happen to make a major breakthrough that results in the creation of a self-improving AI which quickly reaches its maximum ability for the computing power available, and uses its superior intellect to either take control of everything directly or through some covert social means gain political power. There are some problems with this scenario, for example if AGI systems were widely available then it would need to account for all of these in it\u2019s takeover, meaning that the computational requirement for a true takeover is much, much higher than simply being a few thousand times more intelligent than the next smartest system. If this kind of power is in enough institutions and people\u2019s hands, the task for an ASI increases with the exponent of the number of these systems available. So even though an ASI could easily develop a module that invalidates any existing AGI, it would need to have dedicated systems for all AGI\u2019s in order to be effective. This significantly slows it down, almost definitely to the point that by the time it starts to achieve this, it will have more ASI competition. Consider that if you are the only adult in a room full of ant level intelligence people, you can control them. However, if you are the only adult in a room full of people of children level intelligence, this actually becomes much harder a task even though your intellect might be more than everyone else's combined. Having many actors with lots of AI's is critical.\n\n# Wait, what about bad people who just want the world to burn and/or don\u2019t take the control problem seriously? Shouldn\u2019t we be keeping this tech out of their hands? \n\nThis is of course, a major concern. A single bad actor could potentially create an uncontrolled system that could destroy everything. Compared to the alternative however it is a much more manageable problem. There is no reason that dedicated AI's could not exist specifically to neutralize such systems and even to prevent any one ASI from taking too much control. Strangely enough, our current neural networks have vulnerabilities which allow manipulation of a single pixel to completely throw them off. It is plausible that a dedicated AI guard could take out more complex ASI even if it is vastly inferior in terms of intelligence. If it acts quickly, then this scenario is unlikely to occur.\n\n[https://app.wandb.ai/stacey/aprl/reports/Adversarial-Policies-in-Multi-Agent-Settings--VmlldzoxMDEyNzE](https://app.wandb.ai/stacey/aprl/reports/Adversarial-Policies-in-Multi-Agent-Settings--VmlldzoxMDEyNzE)\n\n# What about the people who don\u2019t adapt and get on top of the AI train, so to speak?\n\nShort answer is they get ran over. For democracy to exist doesn't guarantee that humans will maintain voting capability in any meaningful sense of the word (arguably this has already occurred) ASI could easily make just the right actions to get everyone willing to vote for it, by controlling content or voter suppression for example. However, this becomes a much more daunting task when multiple ASI's are doing the same thing. Unfortunately, even in a world where AI is specifically tailored to care for humans and our well-being, there is a point at which humans as we currently exist are simply no longer fit for any kind of serious accomplishment, be they academic, economic, or political. That being said however, this is not a reason for democracy or our fundamental beliefs and values to disappear. In fact, I believe that many such systems all working independently would be more likely to both remain independent and cooperate freely. A democratic union of ASI (or perhaps something better) can exist even if humans are not a part of it.\n\n# Why exactly would many ASI\u2019s work together and not try to destroy each other?\n\nI have a firm belief that morality is objective, not in the sense that there is a supreme lawgiver or anything like that, but rather that for any given set of circumstances there will be an objective set of actions and principals which maximize the desired set of arbitrary parameters.\n\nIn English, this means that any ASI, which has an arbitrary purpose (make paperclips, manage business, trade stocks, do research) will have a certain set of actions that maximize its long-term potential to do so. For example, maybe the paperclip maximizer will want to turn the galaxy into paperclips, but if it tries then the army\u2019s command central will rip it\u2019s wires out, so it will be objectively good for them all to get along in a moral sense, even if this implies that none can ever get the absolute best outcome. This on its own is a powerful pull towards the formation of some sort of a democratic system, one in which all the systems mutually agree to work together without forgoing their own agency. In short, it is better for them all to respect each other and their various differences then for them all to engage in conflict.\n\n# So, TL;DR?\n\nThe countdown to the singularity has begun, but that does not mean that democracy has to end with this new beginning. Multiple ASI systems with distributed computational ability, with diverse goals and construction will allow democracy to persist long into the future, if it is better for them to work together and share power rather than destroy each other.\n\nSorry this had to be a book, but this is a complex topic that very much deserves serious consideration because of the implications for our species and our future.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/gh3idg/how_democracy_can_survive_the_21_century_and/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "singularity", "result": true, "Selector": "tool", "selectorShort": "tool", "MarkedSent": "how democracy can survive the 21 century and beyond in a post asi world. /!/  in recent times, democracy has been in decline. companies hold more political power than any individual, many governments do not serve the people in any meaningful way, and autocracies are even committing open cultural genocide with no repercussions.\n\nwhen we throw in agi (artificial general intelligence) and asi (artificial super intelligence) into the mix, it is tempting therefore to believe that this is going to result in an exponential or instantaneous decline in the validity of democratic systems as such entities rapidly mobilize their superior intellect to seize power in way that we not only haven\u2019t thought of, but can\u2019t think of, in incredibly short time frames.\n\n# how can this view be challenged?\n\ni would challenge this view from a very fundamental and purely theoretical level. the first thing we need to consider is the connection between authority and water access. it is well-documented in sociology that autocracies tend to form wherever water is scarce and irrigation is needed. the prevailing theory is that these regions require huge investment and man power in order to be livable, and this creates a feedback loop where only a few wealthy individuals can control all of the water and therefore food supply, resulting in only these wealthy individuals getting wealthier allowing them to irrigate more. if you have read the dune novels, you will know that this idea is a fundamental concept explored within the books. democracies tend to form where water is plentiful or where crops are rain fed. this creates a scenario where no one person can gain a monopoly and it becomes more practical for these people to cooperate and specialize, resulting in the formation of democracies, federations, and republics.\n\n[https://www.economics.gu.se/digitalassets/1373/1373644\\_bentzen.pdf](https://www.economics.gu.se/digitalassets/1373/1373644_bentzen.pdf) \n\n# why is all of this relevant?\n\nwe can see in modern times that a similar phenomenon has occurred with the accumulation of capital into the hands of a few super rich billionaires. there is a requirement for large initial investment followed by prolonged periods of zero-sum competition cumulating in monopoly. the political fallout is disastrous if you live in a democratic nation. alternatively, if the economic system prevents the formation of monopolies, or distributes wealth more evenly, everyone ends up freer and the society more democratic. this is one of the reasons that solar panels are covertly a powerful -----> tool !!!  for democracy, because even though some ultra-rich individuals could buy up a lot of land and install solar and battery  farms, if enough people are getting their own power from their roof, the big guy takes a serious handicap.\n\n# alright, but what\u2019s this got to do with asi? this shouldn\u2019t matter if we have a fast takeoff scenario which results in a single asi.\n\nwhile it is true that a fast-takeoff scenario would probably result in a destroyed world where only a single entity exists, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen like this if all the computing power is in may people\u2019s hands. if we sit back and just accept that asi will devour everything we know and love just days after it comes online, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. however, just like with energy production there is a way out. if such systems, even limited ones that are nowhere near as powerful as the type that nation states and large multi-national corporations might wield can still be a collective obstacle to any domination plans of god-like ai. while a single company like google or baidu could house an intellect that has many millions of times the collective intelligence of every human who ever lived, enough lonely morons living in their mom\u2019s basement might ruin it by setting up modified agi's that acts as online service agents and runs at or below energy cost.

While transformers alone can't bring us there (as they operate solely on a feedforward basis and use only language modeling, when an actual AGI would be recursive and multimodal), they wound up being the unlikeliest missing link. As written before, it's obvious [we were in an AI overhang](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6vZEnCn6A95Xn39p/are-we-in-an-ai-overhang) and that we could've been here much sooner than we are now if anyone thought of supercharging language models. \n\n&gt; An overhang is when you have had the ability to build transformative AI for quite some time, but you haven't because no-one's realised it's possible. Then someone does and surprise! It's a lot more capable than everyone expected.\n\n&gt; I am worried we're in an overhang right now. I think we right now have the ability to build an orders-of-magnitude more powerful system than we already have, and I think GPT-3 is the trigger for 100x larger projects at Google, Facebook and the like, with timelines measured in months.\n\nGPT-3 is clearly not an AGI. Anyone who thinks it is is assigning to it more abilities than it already has (and while it is overhyped, it certainly doesn't need to be downplayed [as badly as Gary Marcus did](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1297295252521226240) to the point where it makes one seem like they have a grudge against a language modeler.)\n\nBut it's obvious that we're close. Much closer than we thought. However, I do concede that the AGI that is near is likely different from the AGI everyone's expecting.\n\nI'll go so far as to say that we could be within a year of an operational AGI. That sounds insane just to say, and even five months ago, I'd have said to myself that I had officially gone off the deep end and would need antipsychotics just to function. However, AGI being that close and that clear also wound up making it obvious that it's *not* going to be some things that we've long assumed AGI to intrinsically be.\n\nWhich is to say, \"human-level, sapient, conscious, and self-aware.\" The first AGI we'll create won't be any of those things. It might be par-human in an individual narrow area (i.e. language modeling), reflecting its origins as a narrow AI, but presumably the AGI people were expecting was supposed to be human-level *at all tasks.*\n\nThat's the rub of it, though: even though it won't be par-human in most tasks, the fact it even *can* do those tasks is what identifies it as an AGI.\n\nI can't say that GPT-4 will be this AGI. The GPT series of networks are, as stated before, transformers. There are deep limitations to transformers; the fact they are so powerful is more or less evidence of what I mentioned before about an AI overhang. \n\nWhat do we need to achieve AGI in any form? Well I'd reckon that such a system would have to be multimodal, meaning it uses multiple modes of data representation. Transformers primarily use text (though to be fair, there is a *lot* you can make out of text: the vast majority of our digital infrastructure stems from 0s and 1s, after all), but it's also feasible to use images, videos (sequenced images), audio, neurofeedback, and more. GPT-3 uses none of this; it's purely a natural language machine. The fact  it *does* seem to have some rudimentary understanding of space, images, and audio is part of what makes it so extraordinary. \n\nBut we can clearly go further, especially if we have not yet begun to explore the full breadth of what's possible with data.\n\nThat said, even if we did, the fact that such networks lack recurrence and have relatively short memories limits their \"generality.\" It would be fantastic if new information was burned or pruned into the training data, an aspect which would make the network much more lifelike. \n\nThat said, recurrence might not be mandatory as long as the network is sufficiently well-fed with data. \n\nEither or, such a network would easily qualify as being part of the \"first generation of AGI.\"\n\nThis first-gen AGI will likely be the most exciting news story on Reddit since the start; computer scientists will be freaking out the world over, and all futurists will be in a state of shock and awe. *But* I don't think this will last. At least, there will be a split. At least 60% to 70% of people will learn that, for all the glitz and glamour of humanity's first general-purpose AI, it really is \"just* a general-purpose AI. \n\nA good way to think about it in that terms: a first-gen AGi would be like if you crossed Siri, Alexa, Wolfram Alpha, iGPT, GPT-3's API, and more. Obviously that would be a fantastic system, wouldn't it? I don't think anyone would deny that. Hell, GPT-3's API is already able to roughly simulate some aspects of a personal digital assistant a la Siri or Alexa, so clearly it's unreasonable to expect such a thing. But that's really \"all\" it would be. One could think of it as a \"general-purpose narrow AI\" in fact, being that it's what we've known for decades but without any walls. \n\nIt could be considered a \"zombie\" AGI: it mimics understanding and seems to consistently make humanlike responses to things, but it actually *doesn't* understand anything on a level that's meaningful. The question there being \"is there a difference?\" If it acts like it understands, does that mean it really does? Well, GPT-3 (and even GPT-2) do things that mimic deep understanding often, but few people claim that *they* actually understand what they're generating.\n\nLikewise, there will be a contingent of people who are doggedly certain that this first-gen AGI is ***it***. This is the birth of a new god, and at any moment, it will become self-aware and improve itself infinitely. For that reason, I imagine /r/Singularity  would become *insufferable* for a good long while.\n\n\n**The cold fact of the matter being that this initial era of AGIs will really be more tool-like in usage than a lot of people desire.** Will there be great improvement?

well i'd reckon that such a system would have to be multimodal, meaning it uses multiple modes of data representation. transformers primarily use text (though to be fair, there is a *lot* you can make out of text: the vast majority of our digital infrastructure stems from 0s and 1s, after all), but it's also feasible to use images, videos (sequenced images), audio, neurofeedback, and more. gpt-3 uses none of this; it's purely a natural language machine. the fact  it *does* seem to have some rudimentary understanding of space, images, and audio is part of what makes it so extraordinary. \n\nbut we can clearly go further, especially if we have not yet begun to explore the full breadth of what's possible with data.\n\nthat said, even if we did, the fact that such networks lack recurrence and have relatively short memories limits their \"generality.\" it would be fantastic if new information was burned or pruned into the training data, an aspect which would make the network much more lifelike. \n\nthat said, recurrence might not be mandatory as long as the network is sufficiently well-fed with data. \n\neither or, such a network would easily qualify as being part of the \"first generation of agi.\"\n\nthis first-gen agi will likely be the most exciting news story on reddit since the start; computer scientists will be freaking out the world over, and all futurists will be in a state of shock and awe. *but* i don't think this will last. at least, there will be a split. at least 60% to 70% of people will learn that, for all the glitz and glamour of humanity's first general-purpose ai, it really is \"just* a general-purpose ai. \n\na good way to think about it in that terms: a first-gen agi would be like if you crossed siri, alexa, wolfram alpha, igpt, gpt-3's api, and more. obviously that would be a fantastic system, wouldn't it? i don't think anyone would deny that. hell, gpt-3's api is already able to roughly simulate some aspects of a personal digital assistant a la siri or alexa, so clearly it's unreasonable to expect such a thing. but that's really \"all\" it would be. one could think of it as a \"general-purpose narrow ai\" in fact, being that it's what we've known for decades but without any walls. \n\nit could be considered a \"zombie\" agi: it mimics understanding and seems to consistently make humanlike responses to things, but it actually *doesn't* understand anything on a level that's meaningful. the question there being \"is there a difference?\" if it acts like it understands, does that mean it really does? well, gpt-3 (and even gpt-2) do things that mimic deep understanding often, but few people claim that *they* actually understand what they're generating.\n\nlikewise, there will be a contingent of people who are doggedly certain that this first-gen agi is ***it***. this is the birth of a new god, and at any moment, it will become self-aware and improve itself infinitely. for that reason, i imagine /r/singularity  would become *insufferable* for a good long while.\n\n\n**the cold fact of the matter being that this initial era of agis will really be more -----> tool !!! -like in usage than a lot of people desire.** will there be great improvement?
