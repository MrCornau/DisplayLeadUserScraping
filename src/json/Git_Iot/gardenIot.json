We install and test the MicroPython Generic IDF3 firmware when we ship the kits, if you want to use the Arduino IDE you can BUT note the following:\nOnce you use the Arduino IDE you might not be able to use Thonny IDE (MicroPython) again so easily, Thonny IDE might tell you:\nCould not enter REPL. Trying again with 1 second waiting time...\nThis is due to Arduino IDE removing REPL (The MicroPython interpreter) in order to solve it, go to your Thonny IDE settings under interpreter and press \"Open the dialog for installing or upgrading MicroPython\" and select the firmware esp32-idf3-20200902-v1.13.bin (version might be different) which you can download from the links above.\nThis will install REPL again and you'll be able to use MicroPython without any problem. if you'll use Arduino IDE again, you might need to repeat the process.\nEduponics Mini Extension board\nThe Extension board allows to connect extra 4 soil moisture sensors (or any other analog input devices) and extra output devices (digital output devices with 12V support by using relays). The board designed using ADS1115 for ADC support and MCP23017 for GPIO control with some advance functionalities such as interrupt on change and precise analog data reading.\nBoth chips use the I2C protocol which means we can control all the functionalities using only 2 pins (SDA and SCL) it also means it's 100% compatible with Raspberry Pi as it doesn't have a built in ADC.\nThe Extension board code can be found at extension_module/ folder\nLicense\nSome of the code is taken from other repositories, proper credits and license is given at the beginning of each file.
