Not a massive difference though. I saw much bigger differences in the SL. (That just gets to be a better and better camera in my view). The more I look at the M10, the nicer it looks. Video isn't an issue for me... so the M10 would be a good fit, but I'm not remotely concerned about the thinner body (perhaps because I have never owned a Leica film M, so body size isn't an unconsciously learned 'thing' for me (I suspect most wonders complaining about M8/9240 body width are previous or existing film owners). I will still wait for the M10-P as I like my M240P too much to be able to justify the expense of changing right now... I may not even change then, I'll just keep my powder dry for a while.

Close focusing diminishes the angle of incidence lessening the effect and typically involves OoF backgrounds where any smearing could be put down to bokeh and might actually be welcome anyway.

People's understanding of what is and isn't possible is simply weird. I will say this one last time. A lens which has ony one mechanical coupling and can merely tell the camera which lens it is and nothing ore through 6-bit coding, is going to be compromised on anything other than its present platform. The 'magic' of Leica M lenses is that they are small and work well with the rangefinder bodies for which they were designed. Any other body will represent some sort of compromise somewhere. If that is what people want then fine, ask Leica to build it, at a price. But don't expect the images to be as good as those from other systems nor the user experience to be smooth and simple. Neither will be the case. I'm not trying to be argumentative, but I think you're being a little myopic. The geometry that underlies the core of the lens design for all M lenses was conceived long before any notions of digital sensors existed. These optics were designed for compact 35mm film, not digital. As a result, creating a digital M was not as simple as slapping a sensor in an M body and voila. There is however a big difference between impossible and difficult. Ultimately, in spite of the refraction problems introduced by interposing a piece of glass between the digital 'film' and the lens, via some very clever mechanical, optical and software engineering, Leica managed to overcome what previously might have been seen as 'impossible'. One might not be able to repeal the laws of physics, but this is what engineering is about about... dreaming up ways of overcoming these sorts of problems such that it appears that they have been. Referencing 6 bit encoding above is an excellent example. The M didn't start out with lenses being coded, it took over 50 years for that to show up. In the intervening decade and half, the notion of providing 6 bits of information has become rather laughable. But we're just stuck right with 64 values for all eternity now, right? Not necessarily. If, for example, future Ms incorporated an RFID reader, every M mount lens, 6 bit or otherwise, could be equipped or trivially retrofitted updated its correct ID and the optical reader code be dropped. It would be possible to include far more info than just a simple id, as even the simplest of RFID tags has exponentially more bits than are in use today. Plenty of excess memory that could be useful for providing lens specific correction info or perhaps even something more exotic, say table info for -----> ML !!!  based aperture guessing. There is no doubt that some asks, might not be possible or available a a reasonable cost... currently. IBIS or a digital RF in a M size body are two of the seeming impossibilities of this generation.

If you removed the entire optical RF assembly that stretches across the top of the M body, including moving parts (!!), additional RF windows, etc, I would imagine there would be plenty of space to allow an EVF assembly. If Sony can do it in the A7C, which is smaller than an M, why can't Leica do it? Even if we remove IBIS for the time being, an A7C has an EVF, all the hardware required to drive autofocus, and the same size sensor. If we remove the AF motors and control chips and prioritize a high quality EVF like in the Sony Alpha 1 (the current state of the art in EVFs) and strip out the optical rangefinder, a skilled engineering team should be able to do what they need to make this a reality.", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/319914-leica-m11-your-next-camera/?tab=findComment&comment=4259517"}, {"autor": "Dennis", "date": "08/24/2021 07:18  PM", "content": "13 hours ago, cirke said: I have looked in the best OVF (Hasselblad H1, Alpa ...) and its not for me , I like EVF , I can see at night , I can see in B&W, I can zoom x10 And who knows, maybe in the future the -----> AI !!!  will shoot picture for you when you just feel something. In a way or another, all this techie stuff will help to catch the decisive moment, right? But consider that all the things you mention are like help, an addition, an extra, to what a simple M camera with an OVF (only) can do. . Now, try to shoot in harsh daylight a silhouette in BW with the EVF. Yes, you are pre-visualize the scene. And in BW. But you are also losing \"everything\" because you see all pitch black (in the shadows). My point is that to be able to see with EVF the proper exposure, or at night, it's not necessary a good thing. An OVF is always bright, and you see through it the reality. An honest and objective POV of the scene in front of you. It depends (in no particular order) on your skills, approach, feelings, vision, etc., how the final image will look and make people feel about it. For some, it's a labor of PP, some prefer to have an image already great in the raw files with slightly PP. You don't need to see it all to know how a picture will look like. As many already said here, the process is essential. And an OVF, especially for M passionate shooters, most of the time makes the process a better experience. My two cents p.s1 Zoom 10x? I have a binocular 10x25 for that \ud83e\udd14 p.s2 As a pro, I'm ready for a big change. I will probably switch from DSLR to mirrorless in months. It doesn't matter which brand; it will be an EVF anyway. So I will probably start to see some silhouettes as well. But I also know that my M gear is growing, step by step, so the change to acclimate me to an intelligent (and custom to my needs) M system only, for everything. I really believe the M is unbeatable, it's just how one is able to master it. Working in progress on that.

And when I mean \u2018used\u2019, I mean actually done some real world shooting out and about for an extended period. With few exceptions, the SL2-S EVF is as good, if not better than an OVF on a high end DSLR. The only time I found it troublesome is in strong backlit scenarios (especially while using highlight weighted exposure metering) but I think this is something that can be fixed in software and is not a problem of the underlying technology or concept. [Background position statement: I love my M. Of the 15K+ frames I shoot annually, it does 75% or more of them. My best work has been done with an M. I'm on my local dealers list for the M + 2 the day I pick up the M + 1. For as long as I can afford to, I'll keep buying them. I am therefore, not anti-M, nor Auntie Em, nor anti Toto or the Wizard of Oz for that matter.] Personally, I've noticed scenarios where the SL2 EVF outdoes the OVF in low light and others less so. But I can accept that it may well be true that currently the OVF, for those with young enough eyeballs, is superior to most EVFs in ultra low light... today. But last I checked, night vision is done electronically, not optically. If extreme low light viewing was a serious priority for manufacturers, I've little doubt that EVF based systems can far outdo simply looking through glass. So I think the implications of your last point is something possibly missed by some. I have said for many years now that eventually, anything that can be done electronically, rather than mechanically, will be, if for no other reason than cost. But also for the fact that there is far more upside for improving the capability as well. Mechanical shutters are certainly next on the hit list. In the case of the VF, E-viewing, be it software, hardware, -----> AI !!! , ML whatever, will continue to advance at a far greater pace than pure optical systems. Today, there are at least as many reasons to prefer a VF made of glass as there are to shun it. And some of those reasons are likely to always be valid. But eventually, for economics, performance or both, OVF will go the way of the dodo. Might the M OVF escape such a fate? Dunno, perhaps for the novelty of it, but I fear it's unlikely. Back to low light and the SL2. The very first thing I did with the SL2 was shoot at night just to checkout the noise levels and how well IBIS worked. Not quite to the same level of darkness as the previous examples, though it was quite dark, but OTOH I find it more interesting to shoot with at least some minimal light source around anyway. In both cases, SL-75, F2.0 ISO 1600 1/30\".

Pixel mapping will use the full sensor at at least two, maybe three other resolutions. Oh and as others have said this could add 1-2 stops of DR to the M10R. I think a clean ISO 12,800 would reduce the need for IBIS. Bottom plate on or off, a battery like the Q2 or SL2/SL2S would be lovely, and likely to make a standard battery for the FF Leica line up (sans the CL/TL and S3, which require different EQ.) So this rumor I expect fully. I would say they will Keep the upper body of M10, and change the bottom plate, not horribly off putting. Also this will keep all of the M10 accessories, not like the M240 which made all the accessories immediately obsolete. I think Leica is trying to forget the M240. I think a modern M should have USB-C charging (which means adding a port), GPS via a multifunction handgrip would be nice or a new Visoflex (make the Visoflex backward comparable). Tethering would be nice, for those of us that use the M in studio (few of us, but it\u2019s significant for those of us that do it). But not a real deal breaker if not. I don\u2019t need two SD card slots, but maybe some internal memory or Bluetooth back up to Fotos. I personally want about 9-10 fps, a new processor, larger buffer. Maybe some more computational toys like perspective control. Outside of all this, I think some fine tuning on color profiles would be helpful. In camera DNG processing. A black chrome, black paint and chrome version at launch, and upgrade program from the M240-M10 with a half-off trade in will get a lot of people to make the switch. Maybe some of this is going to be real. Maybe there will be a unicorn in each box and the sensor will show all the souls it has captured through some -----> AI !!!  algorithm, ha. Maybe nothing at all.

I think it would be fair to say I agree with all of them. I would only take issue with the idea that Leica users can focus faster than a modern AF camera. I've seen that claim made on this forums -often accompanied by a tack sharp shot or two, but I consider these posts to be anecdotal. I'd love it for a NYC based Leica shooter to reach out so we can do some side by side testing on video. Nothing intended to embarrass anyone. I'd even do it without video if anyone were interested. But I'd be shocked beyond words if a Leica user could manually focus on different subjects faster than I could nail focus on a Z6. Hell, I'll even use my 10+ year old Nikon D3s and I'm confident the camera autofocuses faster than anyone can manually focus a rangefinder or any other type of manual focus camera. To be honest, John, I have always struggled with auto-focus. My first auto-focus camera was an F5, then a D800e, then the T, TL2, SL and X1D II and none of them were as reliable or fast in practice as my manual focus FE/FM cameras, manual focus -----> AI !!!  Nikkor lenses or my M cameras. With each I had what were supposed to be the best AF lenses, and still I struggled. Worst was my niece\u2019s wedding, where I elected (for reasons I still don\u2019t understand) to take the X1D II, with the 21, 45, 80 and 135 (& 1.7 converter). Switching lenses was a nightmare, lugging those lenses drove me crazy, and the AF just wouldn\u2019t focus quickly enough to grab those moments which make wedding photographs so special. And, of course, manual focus by wire is very poor compared to Leica\u2019s manual focus M primes. To be fair, the few images that worked were favoured by the happy couple over the professional photographer\u2019s images, taken with what looked like a DX with an auto-focus zoom. Now, I\u2019d be the first to admit that my dislike of AF has stood in the way of my mastering it for the last 30 years or so. But AF in my experience too often fails to focus at all, or fails to focus on the right thing. In your test, it may be quicker than an M lens, but will it focus on the right thing? I have never been able to achieve that with AF. When I see a potential image unfold, I think about where I want the subject, what is going to happen next and the depth of field I want (most of this instinctive), then I frame, focus and take the image. I know what I\u2019m going to get in focus. With my SL, I back-button focus, then adjust manually. Auto-focus with some of Nikon\u2019s best lenses has never achieved that for me. I suspect the fastest part of the process is a couple of inches behind the viewfinder. I appreciate your experience differs, but there is, perhaps, a reason why Leica continues to produce so many, such fine, manual focus M lenses, and they sell.

The M11 will use the Maestro 3 Processor - Leica Marketing will try its best to convince us that this combo yields even better sensor performance. Image quality wise, the difference between M10R and M11 will be negligible. The M11 body will be ever so slightly different from the M10 body. Perhaps an integrated faux advance lever acting as a thumb rest. Andreas Kaufman mentioned in the Hugh Brownstone interview that Leica sales have been hit very badly due to Covid related store closures - leading to excess inventory than projected for this time in the M10 life cycle. The M10R sensor was introduced early to help reduce excess inventory. The R designation is not the beginning of a new trend. The M 11 will be introduced in the next 12 months. M11P in the next 24 months. What does this all mean for me?

There is a bit of debate on another thread about tripods, although most of us see 35mm as a hand-held format with odd exceptions, which I guess could be about a photographers technique, as even at 24mp with the latest lenses your technique needs to be good to achieve best possible outcomes.

I am not arguing what it should mean, but wondering what it means in the context of your post... Essentially that the mid-tones fall on Zone V, if that there is where I want them; and for shots into the light, or with strong sidelight, when I'm exposing for the high-lights, that the main subject is exposed where I want it, after I lift shadows and mid-tones to where I want them. My issue with the M10 is that it's necessary to underexpose too much when exposing for the highlights, compared to many other cameras (the Ricoh GRIII in my case), and that this results from the contrast curve that Leica applied to the M10 DNGs, which allocates too little of the available dynamic range to the highlights. Sorry that I wrote such a long off-topic post above, but it's an issue that I'm interested in and @otto.f's post touched on that. On the topic of this thread itself, I agree with @pedaes's thought that it would be interesting to have a comparison of Lightroom Super Resolution to the Topaz -----> AI !!!  tools; and also agree with @Jeff S's statement that the necessary sensor resolution really depends on what the photographer wants. This has a long history. On the old Leica forums, people would say that, if you wanted print's larger than 11x14 \u2014 or even 8x10, though some said 16x20 \u2014 you needed to go to medium format film. All this was blown out of the water for me when, around 2006, I saw the Daido Moriyama retrospective at the Gallery of New South West in Sydney, with sixty prints of 100x150 cm printed on an Epson wide-format inkjet printer from 35 mm Twi-X negatives. The prints were dazzling, but clearly this type of high-contrast work requires less resolution than certain types of landscape. On a future M11, I would like to see a sensor something like the one that Leica uses in the SL2S. ________________________Frog Leaping photobook", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/322645-does-lr-super-resolution-obviate-the-need-to-upgrade-to-m10-r/?tab=findComment&comment=4236897"}, {"autor": "pgk", "date": "07/12/2021 05:59  PM", "content": "11 hours ago, setuporg said: As a computer scientist, I believe the \u201csuperresolution\u201d is a particular form of sharpening through -----> deep learning !!!  algorithms.

I didn't know that something as Gigapixel AI was existing; I thought it was only for movies and not for all mortals. \ud83e\udd23 I feel nowadays a lot the concept of the paradox of choice. Interesting resume below, go to the link for more. Barry Schwartz believes that having a lot of options isn\u2019t always a good thing. A professor of social theory and social action at Swarthmore College, he argues that instead of producing feelings of abundance, too much choice overwhelms our already-exhausted brains. An abundance of choice, writes Schwartz in his book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less \u2014 How the Culture of Abundance Robs Us of Satisfaction (Harper Perennial, 2005), forces us to \u201cinvest time, energy, and no small amount of self-doubt, and dread\u201d into each decision, leaving us feeling more constrained than liberated. \u201cClinging tenaciously to all the choices available to us,\u201d writes Schwartz, \u201ccontributes to bad decisions, to anxiety, stress and dissatisfaction \u2014 even to clinical depression.\u201d Maximizers Vs. Satisficers There are two types of decision makers, says Schwartz: maximizers and satisficers. The difference between the two is their goal when making a choice. \u201cIf you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer,\u201d writes Schwartz. \u201cMaximizers need to be assured that every purchase or decision was the best that could be made.\u201d Satisficers, on the other hand, will choose \u201csomething that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better.\u201d The key to experiencing more satisfaction and abundance, according to Schwartz, is to be a satisficer. \u201cHow can anyone truly know that any given option is absolutely the best possible?\u201d ponders Schwartz. \u201cAs a decision strategy, maximizing creates a daunting task, which becomes all the more daunting as the number of options increases.\u201d The goal of maximizing, he asserts, \u201ccan make people miserable \u2014 especially in a world that insists on providing an overwhelming number of choices, both trivial and not so trivial. \u201dBeing a satisficer doesn\u2019t mean you have to sacrifice your standards, however. A satisficer maintains rigorous decision-making criteria, but she is aware that nothing can ever be perfect. \u201cShe searches until she finds an item that meets those standards, and at that point, she stops,\u201d writes Schwartz. She is not resigned or settling, he emphasizes; she is \u201ccontent with the merely excellent as opposed to the absolute best.\u201d Are you a Maximizer or a Satisficer? The paradox of choice, the camera specs comparison, digital world VS , etc. It takes us, step by step, away from the truth. Of course, since dark rooms first step, PP has always existed: to give life to the next stage of the process after the exposure, right? The personal interpretation was and still is essential. And it helps to reach the photographer's goal, his/her vision, and unique signature style. But this doesn't have to distract us from our original purpose: create stunning work in camera, just with an idea: film, or BSI CMOS whatever... I think there is not more exciting emotion that reaches a great photo in camera, despite the MP# ... w/o AI ... And of course with 24 or 40meg. Who cares?

A bad photo is a bad photo on all sensors, true. I can't speak to the M10M as I've never used one, but the Q2M is mind-blowing. It absolutely resolves more detail than a color sensor \u2013 ~30% acuity increase from removing the Bayer color filter array. Anecdotal cases of users \"not seeing it\" does not change that fact. The results from the Q2M are equal to or better than b&w conversions from my GFX 50R with the GF 30 lens. But to your point, a better sensor cannot compensate for some things: the Q2M files are still a little soft in the far corners since the Q Summilux requires a tremendous amount of software distortion correction.

Probably not a big loss, as Ken Rockwell though it was a terrible lens. Any thoughts or advice? I know it's expensive, but last time I was searching, people told me it's \"the best\". I do work with both a Novoflex and a FotodioX adapter on a M10-R, M10-M and M10-P \"Reporter\" As for the Novoflex adapter, it is very precise, but also pretty \"stiff\". There seems to be absolutely no play between the Nikkor lens and the adapter. This is supposed to make sure that focusing remains very precise, especially with wide open glass such as the Nikkor -----> Ai !!! -S 50/1.2. Focusing on a RF can be utmost critical as we all know. The drawback: sometimes it es very difficult to dismount the lens from the adapter. On the other side, I can also use Nikon G lenses such as the 58/1.4G with that adapter on my M10 body, a lens that is unrivalled for its transition into soft background (\"bokeh\") I also use a FotodioX adapter, mainly for my Carl Zeiss lenses ZF.2 15/2.8 and ZF.2 135/2 (normally used on my Nikon D850). Here it is easy to mount and dismount the lens, but the link/connection is not as stiff as with the Novoflex and I am not sure, whether in critical focus situations (mainly the 135/2 wide open) I get maximum focus accuracy. For G lenses you will have to use an different FotodioX adapter. As for Ken Rockwell's opinion about lenses, I am very careful to say at least. He keeps writing his \"reviews\" long before the lenses are available. As a pro Nikon shooter I usually get the newest lens first before anyone else has a chance to get hold of it. And Ken writes \"tests\" even when lenses are officially delayed... I do love the Nikon Ai-S 50/1.2 for its nice bokeh wide open. Actually it has an equally convincing \"analog\" look as the recently re-introduced Leica Noctilux 1.2/50mm. From f/2 onwards, the Nikkor is one of the sharpest Nikon lenses ( I own 20+ AF-S lenses and 5 Ai-S lenses, and comparing the Ai-S 50/1.2 to lenses like the PC 85/2.8, AF-S 105/1.4, AF-S 28/1.4 and the latest AF-S 120-300/2.8 amongst others drew me to that conclusion.) That's why I enjoy using this lens on the Nikon D850 or Df and on the M10-X, especially wide open, for the film look. I also love the Canon FD 1.2/55 S.S.C. Aspherical on the M10, but this is really a chunky piece of glass... FYI I own original M lenses such as the SEM 21, the FLE 35/1.4, the APO 75/2 and just recently added the 28/1.4, so I can compare my Nikon gear to Leica gear. Apart from the 50/1.2 I use Carl Zeiss lenses on the adaptors, mainly 15/2.8, 25/2 and 135/2. Hope, this was of any help to make your decision.

This question is, of course, lurking around every corner for me! In the struggle to answer it, I did find some clues as to what I should do now. Let me share some of it with you because I do appreciate the comment more than you realize. My journey in photography started when I was around 7 years old. I picked up this huge accordion style Polaroid camera and was hooked ever since. My dad used to let me carry it around for him until one day it was just understood that it was no longer his I then discovered 35mm through Minolta and Nikon and spent many hours in the high school darkroom. I never once gave any thought to the model of the camera or its features. For probably 10 years I owned a Nikon N90s and the only thing I ever changed were the batteries! When the Nikon D100 came out, I grabbed it and although it was APS-C and I preferred full frame, I enjoyed it for many many years. I was looking into buying a Nikon D700, when I went down the rabbit hole completely. I was intrigued by the Leica M8, but finally came across a used M9. I was instantly having visions of a smaller camera system. I can still remember the feeling of a backpack full of gear while traveling through Europe. Since we are on a Leica forum, I can sum up this phase of life like this, and you can fill in the blanks: MP film, M9, M240, with and without Visoflex, Q, M10. The pros of this saga: the exquisite design of Leica cameras, the care put into the details and simplicity of use. The connection back to the \u201cmanual\u201d days. The cons: due to the high cost of this equipment, there was more pressure to make those purchases \u201cmatter.\u201d What worked for me was the connection to the Leica camera. It was never perfect. I missed as many shots as I hit. I liked looking through the glass and seeing the real world. I liked \u201cprevisualizing\u201d what a shot would look like, and then comparing it when I took the shot. I liked the manual aperture and shutter controls and the film speed dial. For the first time in literally decades, I was thinking in photographic terms again. Looking at a street and saying \u201cthat\u2019s about ISO 800, at 1/60 of a second, at f8.\u201d My experience with the Leica M was incredible. It improved my photography skills immeasurably. That is really what still draws me to the M system - it is a continual masterclass in slowing down. Sometimes it causes me stress, and sometimes it is liberating. One thing I can tell you: my Sony A9 does nothing for me like this. I don\u2019t love the EVF experience and I don\u2019t like the dials and buttons and menus. I am drawn to the simplicity and elegance of Leica, and the way the cameras inspire me to go out and shoot. You are 100% right about one thing though. The cameras today are all so good. As long as it can shoot at ISO 1600 that is already more than enough for me. As I posted before, I\u2019m stuck between the M and the SL2. My worry with the SL2 is that it is just a really really good version of the Sony A9. Maybe your post leads me closer to the realization that I am M bound. I think back to my M9. I didn\u2019t sell it because I hated it, I sold it because I loved it! I figured the next version would be even better. Since I still drive my car from 1997, I do want to tell everyone that it is better to keep something long enough to render it technologically obsolete. Then the pressure is off!", "link": "https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/317675-caught-between-a-rock-m-and-a-hard-place-sl2/?tab=findComment&comment=4140430"}, {"autor": "petermullett", "date": "04/23/2019 05:49  PM", "content": "On 4/12/2019 at 6:52 PM, petermullett said: .......... but in the many decades that I've owned all sorts of gear, many cameras, I've yet to find one that's \"perfect\".\ufeff.....and probably never will so I just get on with what works for me and with the M10-D that's more than enough to float my boat.\ufeff Since posting this the other week I've been thinking whether there were any cameras that have come close to perfect for me, and yes perhaps there was......sorry not a Leica M, close, but no cigar, at least not yet.

However, what it cannot do is render the extra fine detail that is produced by high-resolution sensors, as it is simply not there in the file. So no, it cannot replace a high-resolution sensor. And it can use a 40 MP file and give it the same boost again. No doubt that you capture tinier things with a higher-res sensor, given the same lens (assuming the lens resolves them... which is not a given with a lot of older glass, especially focused by old eyes). I think high MP sensors help sell expensive lenses (which have no point unless you can blackboard a big system resolution) and facilitate steep crops. Those sensor also help preserve a sufficient data volume with more severe forms of post-processing perspective correction. But the world has largely settled around 24mp mirrorless cameras, which suggests that statistically, that's acceptable for most uses. We're coming onto the eighth or ninth year for the Sony A7 line where the main camera still 24.2mp and includes models as late as July 2020 with 12.1mp(!) sensors. And certainly, a massive uptick in responsiveness or reliability in a camera can make an incidental upgrade compelling. For example, the M8/M9 architecture got to an 18mp resolution, but from the M240 on, the user experience improved considerably. More data was just a plus. My questions about obviation have more to do with having sufficient resolution for any size output than they are about catching the tiniest cheek fuzz of a 21-year-old woman in a head shot. I'm not sure that the smallest meaningful aesthetic level of detail has really moved off the \"texture of concrete\" or a \"non-aliased eyelash.\" Even in landscapes, I'm not sure that any picture has been made or broken by being able to resolve a telephone wire at 1000m vs 2000m. If there is an identifiable subject in a picture, it's hard to point to one that is defined primarily (or even appreciably) by the smallest thing a sensor or film grain can see. There is an \"ooh and ah\" factor to the microscopic, but that's for discussion sites. In prints, the only place you are not discarding most of the data for an output, the real mark a camera needs to hit is to create enough data about sufficient levels of detail aesthetically and enlarge for a normal viewing distance without adding blur or artifacts. Ansel Adams believed that this might take as few as 1 megapixels, which is obviously low, but the point remains that the bigger the print, the greater the normal viewing distance. This is the theory upon which depth of field relies - circles of confusion. By the numbers, you need 120dpi at a 1.5m viewing distance. From an M9, that's a 43.3\" (110cm) print, which is frankly enormous. Obviously with the M240/M10 you get a 50\"/127cm output at that resolution. My testing of Super Resolution was prompted by a project where I was making large prints (18\"/46cm short side) for a client from 24mp M files and wondered what the resulting image files (300dpi) would look like in an unrealistic 100% view on screen. If they don't show artifacts at that size, unrealistic as it is, there is zero real-world chance that anyone would detect issues in the finished prints, no matter how close they got to them. And when the prints from this experiment came back yesterday, they stood up to the 40cm scrutiny test (that's about the expectation for an adult's eye to even focus). So no pixels, no artifacts on a close-up look in person, on a print. The ultimate installation location for these would not allow a human to approach closer than 1.5m, so rescaling was always overkill anyway. I did read Margulis' article on unsharp masking and Super Resolution. I know what he wrote, but if his illustrations are indicative, his conclusions seem to assume a much higher tolerance for halos on high contrast edges. I didn't see the results as exactly equal, and the point of the -----> machine learning !!!  is to cut down on that.

Yes, I think the choice on buying new M systems today is (at least as I personally see it) basically just down to two cameras for most users to really consider; either the M240 for a limited/reasonable budget, or the M10-R for a much less limited budget. The improved shutter on the M-P 240 and my M-E 240 is quite quiet I think, but l do appreciate the higher ISO and DR capability I see in the photos from the M10-R. Leica made very good improvements already with the M10 sensor, but the new one in the M10-R seems to be a really great sensor. Just wish Leica also had upgraded the CPU and memory at the same time to better match and cope with the increased resolution (the camera electronics seems to slow down considerably with the increased amount of data that has to be processed from the M10-R sensor).

But I have seen beautiful results as well, even at ISO 2500. How do I get the best quality images at high-ISO? Answer: There is a vital difference between the M9 and all other high-end digital cameras. The M9 has virtually no in-camera noise reduction at high ISO, resulting in more detail, but also more visible noise. To avoid this noise, there are two steps to be taken, but first consider the type of photograph: Low contrast diffuse light or high contrast with specular highlights. The first trick is to gather as many photons on the sensor as possible to improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) without overexposing. That means: use the histogram. And go manual. It is easiest with the flat image - just bunch the peak up to the right and flatten the lefthand side of the histogram. The high contrast image will need clipping of the specular highlights. So move them off the righthand side of the histogram, and you will see the signal coming up on all other light levels. There is your optimum SNR which you must try to preserve whilst taking photographs by manually adjusting the exposure to the amount of real light, i.e. disregarding the bright spotlights that are trying to fool you into underexposing. This presupposes that you are on manual and are spending some time \u201c shooting the histogram in\u201d before starting to shoot in earnest. Note that at ISOs below about 1250 you have enough SNR leeway to start trying to preserve highlights - a whole different game than avoiding noise! Now we come to the second step: the capture sharpening and noise reduction in Adobe Camera raw 6 and Lightroom 3. I will describe the procedure for ACR 6.0, Lightroom users will be able to translate this easily, as it is basically the same. First make sure the program is set to Process Version 2010. You will find the setting under the Camera Calibration menu. If an exclamation mark appears on the lower righthand side of your preview it means you have an image that has been processed in Version 2003. Click the exclamation mark to reset the Process Version. With the image open (make sure your output parameters are set to 16 bits!) adjust the color balance and exposure to taste, and switch to the detail panel and hit alt-option(command)-0 to go to 100% view. We will use the sliders from top to bottom( more or less), bearing in mind that ACR is non-destructive and, with a subsequent adjustment made it is wise to got back to the previous steps for finetuning. It takes some experience to \u201c play\u201d all settings to their optimum. Sharpening slider. Set for the optimum detail separation (normally between about 10 and 40), never mind that you seem to increase the noise, in conjunction with the next Radius slider Use the range of 0.5 to 1.5, never more. 0.5 is for high-frequency detail images like wooded landscapes, 1.5 for low-frequency detail images like glamour portraits. Once set, bearing in mind that visible halos and artefacts introduced here will get you in trouble later, skip the next Detail slider for the time being. And go to the Masking Slider. Then drag it with the alt key held down and you will see an edge mask being created on the fly. This will only be visible with the image at 100% or larger. It shows ( in white) what areas are being sharpened and (in black) which ones are being protected. So drag it until only the edges you want sharpened are showing. Never mind the small detail. For that you have the Detail slider. Alt-drag that one until you have your fine detail back without enhancing too much noise. Now go to the noise-reduction group. First go to Color. Normally the default setting of 25 will be fine to suppress the color noise completely, but by all means play with the slider to find the optimum setting. If you get some color bleeding on color edges you can move the Color Detail slider from its default of 50, but be careful not to go too far left as it will make the image digitally smooth. ( the same for the Luminance Detail slider) Normally you won\u2019t be using those two. The most important slider of the group is the Luminance slider Pull it right to see the noise disappear. When you are happy, go back to the sharpening group and tweak if needed, back to luminance, etc. (*) And you are done, go back to the adjustments panel. Now if you have a mixed frequency image, you can correct by using the adjustment brush and tweak the sharpening, both to more sharp ( for instance the eyes in a portrait) or softer ( for instance the skin of somebody in a landscape) (**). Then go on and open the image. Now this is a long instruction manual, but with a bit of practice it gets really quick and easy, and you can of course make a few presets for image types you commonly shoot. (*)This is a most interesting slider. At a setting between 0 and 10 it will act as an extra sharpening slider for low-noise images, as it seems to add a bit of fine random structure, which enhances the impression of sharpness (**) Of course, for the more Photoshop-minded the elegant way to do this is to optimize for one frequency, open as a Smart Object, copy and redo for the other frequency, create a layer mask in PS and paint in the effect, but on the whole I find that a bit of overkill for routine use.

That could be useful. I agree I need to find the right sweet spot for exposure, but I don't see myself looking at histograms out on the street.

Any DOF scale, for any lens, is going to the be the same, for any camera. Focusing accuracy is linear, with the axis of the lens. The blur problems we see with higher-resolution cameras are more likely the result of shooter movement, across pixels. If one stands, within a tiny box, one is more likely to touch the sides, than if one is standing within a large box. Well, individual pixels can be seen as tiny boxes. More pixels, per unit of area, means each pixel is smaller. Crashing into multiple boxes makes a mess. Shooting with technique that is is inadequate for the task makes a mess, across those tiny pixels. My first two DSLRs had/have 10MP sensors. The third, a Canon 7D, at 18MP, was quite a leap, and required an improvement in technique. The next big leap was the 50MP Canon 5Ds R. Macro and close-range shooting was important, during this MP progression, as I was doing evidentiary/forensic/crime scene photography. DOF is very thin, as the range gets closer. I never noticed focus accuracy becoming more difficult, whether the camera was a 10MP 40D, or a 50MP 5Ds R. As a mater of actual practice, the huge files of the 5Ds R were a bit much for the proprietary software in the police department\u2019s computer, so I only used the 5Ds R for one crime scene, a limo bus that had been shot full of holes. Trivia: One compensates for fore-and-aft movement, at close range, by using Continuous AF, or, in Canon-speak, -----> AI !!!  Servo, just as if shooting a ball game, at longer range. Yes, hand-held macro is possible.
