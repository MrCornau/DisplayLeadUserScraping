I'm part of a Young Enterprise team from the UK. Firstly, this isn't a sales pitch, just market research. We have been challenged to come up with a product or service and then manufacture, market and sell it. Currently, we are only at the beginning of the process and are still thinking of ideas.\n\nOur current strongest idea is a tool/device that measures the water level in the soil of plants. We are aware of similar items available but we would be focusing on sustainability with regards to production and packaging as well as a focus on aesthetics. Plants are quite commonly used for decoration and we don't want to make something that sticks out like a sore thumb. We would be aiming to sell the product somewhere in the region of \u00a35-10 but this would be decided once all costs are calculated. \n\nTheoretically, would this be something you might consider purchasing? If so, would you be happy with the price and features?\n\nIf not, what could we change to make it appeal to you? What elements could we add or remove?\n\nThank you all very much and have a lovely day!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/ivalld/research_would_you_use_this_item/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "gardening", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "[research] would you use this item? /!/ hello everyone! hope this post is allowed here! i'm part of a young enterprise team from the uk. firstly, this isn't a sales pitch, just market research. we have been challenged to -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  a product or service and then manufacture, market and sell it. currently, we are only at the beginning of the process and are still thinking of ideas.\n\nour current strongest idea is a tool/device that measures the water level in the soil of plants. we are aware of similar items available but we would be focusing on sustainability with regards to production and packaging as well as a focus on aesthetics. plants are quite commonly used for decoration and we don't want to make something that sticks out like a sore thumb. we would be aiming to sell the product somewhere in the region of \u00a35-10 but this would be decided once all costs are calculated. \n\ntheoretically, would this be something you might consider purchasing? if so, would you be happy with the price and features?\n\nif not, what could we change to make it appeal to you? what elements could we add or remove?\n\nthank you all very much and have a lovely day!", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 0, "comments": 9, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/ivalld/research_would_you_use_this_item/", "identifyer": 86311, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 90063, "autor": "Cupro-Pringle", "date": 1587378510000, "content": "Gravel compaction on a shoestring. /!/ So I need a solution here and I need it fast, because my family isn't going to stop bullying me about this until I come up with something (I'm \"the smart one\", you see) - how do you compact a large area of gravel without using an expensive tool like a plate compactor?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/g4qdk0/gravel_compaction_on_a_shoestring/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "gardening", "result": true, "Selector": "come up with", "selectorShort": "with", "MarkedSent": "gravel compaction on a shoestring. /!/ so i need a solution here and i need it fast, because my family isn't going to stop bullying me about this until i -----> come !!!  -----> up !!!  -----> with !!!  something (i'm \"the smart one\", you see) - how do you compact a large area of gravel without using an expensive tool like a plate compactor?", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 2, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/g4qdk0/gravel_compaction_on_a_shoestring/", "identifyer": 90063, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 105089, "autor": "GrandmaGos", "date": 1589297432000, "content": "K, so, I'm writing a FAQ.
