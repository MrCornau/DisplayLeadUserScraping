Seeking input from more experienced DIYers on hinges, frame support, and overall design. Want to build this right the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Overall Build Concept](https://preview.redd.it/d1pvslzq7jr51.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a4939df8e7f87b4a703475acc249d0a752e8da8)\n\nThis gate is going at the top of the stairs on our back deck. We have small dogs (a Dachshund and a MinPin mix, and yes there are pics of them below!) and very steep stairs, so we built them a ramp for their ease and comfort, as well as to protect their joints and backs. This gate is to ensure they use the ramp and not the stairs, because old habits die hard. They know how to use the ramp and are comfortable on it, but the stairs are right there....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm working out some details of the design before we go further, and have some questions and concerns especially with the hinges and how to support the frame to prevent sagging or warping. I am also aiming to get feedback from more experienced DIYers to avoid pitfalls. I know that I don't know what I don't know. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What we have:**\n\n\\- Husband and I have some experience with handiwork like this, but we're definitely beginners\n\n\\- We have lots of good tools (including battery powered drill gun, skill saw, circular saw, and a corner clamp) but we can't really afford to buy any more tools at the moment unless they're cheap. (Similarly we can't buy a prefab gate, thus the DIY!)\n\n\\- We already have the wood and chicken wire we're using, but no hinges or latch or support parts. We won't be buying different wood for the frame or a different wire mesh unless it's really necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Expectations of this gate:**\n\n\\- Gate does not need to bear weight, we do not expect the dogs to push/dig/jump at or on it. (also no children around to mess with it)\n\n\\- Durability! We want this to not need replacement or repair for a long time. We want to do it right the first time.\n\n\\- We live in the Salt Lake valley in Utah, the stairs are several yards from our house, and our deck is not covered. This gate and its hardware needs to endure snow, rain, high temps, low temps, etc. We will be painting the wood with the same \"deck protect\" sealant the rest of our deck and the dog ramp used.\n\n\\- Aesthetics are not a big consideration, we don't want it to look like trailer trash garbage but we're not making high art. Function over fashion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Specs**:\n\n\\- Measurements for the opening the gate covers: 39\" across, 31\" tall, 3\" deep ( constrained by deck supports being 3x3s)\n\n\\- Gate will be 38\" across, 30\" tall (allowing swing space) and 3\" deep\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Overall Build Concept](https://preview.redd.it/kka224ie7jr51.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1880d997745994dc89230dc9a386abfbf5b4a1a)\n\n**Overall Build Concept Image Explanation:**\n\n\\- Yellow is the existing deck structure where we're building. The gate will open inward, toward the deck, not toward the stairs.\n\n\\- The gate's frame is layered: red and orange are 3\"x0.5\" redwood boards. 0.5\" sides face the viewer. We have already purchased these boards but have not cut them.\n\n\\- Cross-hatching is chicken wire (leftover from another project) because small dogs are wiley but they can't get through a 1\" mesh! \n\n\\- The edges of the chicken wire will be attached to the inner orange layer with staples, and completely enclosed between the layers of the frame to prevent any stray wire edges (lesson learned from the aforementioned other project).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Support Options](https://preview.redd.it/v5qmuuci7jr51.png?width=509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e98ba1ef9016527e5e4fe8d12fb2106e0b7dbe9)\n\nThe different support options we're considering. My husband is insisting on #1 but I haven't seen any gate supported that way while I've been researching.\n\n\\#1 - a solid triangular piece of wood\n\n\\#2 - a wooden strut made from the same wood as the frame\n\n\\#3 - a metal brace screwed onto the outside of the frame\n\n\\#4 - a metal L-shaped brace screwed into the inner edge of the frame\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Supports we are NOT considering](https://preview.redd.it/6fe3bfcm7jr51.png?width=509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3bdd903837dbd01ea82bccd6ce29370eb349c27)\n\nWe're not currently considering these supports. Ignore the metal brace visible here, I forgot to paint it out of the image. Whoops.\n\n\\#5 - wooden slats in an X shape across the inside of the frame. My husband is convinced that this doesn't work at all and that the frame will still wobble and warp. I find that odd considering this is the most common support I've seen in my research, but he's insistent that it is completely useless.\n\n\\#6 - Vertical wooden slats we're not going with simply because it's excessively complicated for our needs, and it adds more visual appeal than support anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hinge Options](https://preview.redd.it/lqbzsxbw7jr51.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc1b98b2eb2e8b74ef8ee759176991ca5bc48dcd)\n\nHinge options and concerns - the span markings here indicate the dimension I'm concerned about for these options.\n\n\\#7 - Simple butt-hinge. Easy to find in self-closing (a bonus but not required), easy to find in the right size, lots of options. But I'm worried about stability considering the width of the gate. I read somewhere that you should use a strap hinge that is 1/5th the width of your door/gate. \n\nIf I use two 3\" wide butt hinges, are they going to be able to securely support a 38\" gate? Honestly this is my only concern with this option. If a butt hinge will be plenty secure I'm not going to bother with a strap hinge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8 - T-shaped strap hinge.  I read somewhere that you should use a strap hinge that is 1/5th the width of your door/gate. I can easily find one with an 8\" long strap. BUT the frame of the gate is only 1\" vertically, and lots of T-straps have their screws all right along the middle (as pictured), which would either put them right in the seam or necessitate finding an even thinner strap, which might in turn reduce the support capacity. \n\nIs it worth bothering to try and find one with a strap less than 1\" tall? \n\nI know that dummy straps exist, but I don't think they actually offer any structural support. Is there a way to combine a dummy strap with a butt hinge to add support (not just for looks)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Very Good Girls**\n\n[ Aloy the long haired Dachshund \\(1.5 years old\\) and Karma the MinPIn Chihuahua mix \\(we think. \\~7 years old, rescue\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/56b7xr948jr51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273e6e72d338e2e06e890524d0bae9253c8afee5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The doggie ramp \\(I'm very proud of it\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cdw761598jr51.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a21b4ff5b706e15f5981c51530ee53cc005f62)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/j6cmxt/deck_gate_help_with_hinges_and_design_please/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "DIY", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "deck gate - help with hinges and design please /!/ [https://imgur.com/gallery/hllwyt9](https://imgur.com/gallery/hllwyt9) has all the images and the same info\n\ntl;dr: building a gate on our deck to remind our dogs to use their ramp instead of the stairs. seeking input from more experienced diyers on hinges, frame support, and overall design. want to build this right the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[overall build concept](https://preview.redd.it/d1pvslzq7jr51.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a4939df8e7f87b4a703475acc249d0a752e8da8)\n\nthis gate is going at the top of the stairs on our back deck. we have small dogs (a dachshund and a minpin mix, and yes there are pics of them below!) and very steep stairs, so we built them a ramp for their ease and comfort, as well as to protect their joints and backs. this gate is to ensure they use the ramp and not the stairs, because old habits die hard. they know how to use the ramp and are comfortable on it, but the stairs are right there....\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni'm working out some details of the design before we go further, and have some questions and concerns especially with the hinges and how to support the frame to prevent sagging or warping. i am also aiming to get feedback from more experienced diyers to avoid pitfalls. i know that i don't know what i don't know. :)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**what we have:**\n\n\\- husband and i have some experience with handiwork like this, but we're definitely beginners\n\n\\- we have lots of good tools (including battery powered drill gun, skill saw, circular saw, and a corner clamp) but we can't really afford to buy any more tools at the moment unless they're cheap.

\n\ni know that dummy straps exist, but i don't think they actually offer any structural support. is there a way to combine a dummy strap with a butt hinge to add support (not just for looks)?\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**the very good girls**\n\n[ aloy the long haired dachshund \\(1.5 years old\\) and karma the minpin chihuahua mix \\(we think. \\~7 years old, rescue\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/56b7xr948jr51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273e6e72d338e2e06e890524d0bae9253c8afee5)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[the doggie ramp \\(i'm very proud of it\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cdw761598jr51.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a21b4ff5b706e15f5981c51530ee53cc005f62)", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 4, "media": "self", "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/j6cmxt/deck_gate_help_with_hinges_and_design_please/", "identifyer": 267918, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 267978, "autor": "prnrathod81", "date": 1602758382000, "content": "WotNot ---&gt; DIY no-code chatbot builder /!/ There are many chatbot tools available but how many of them let you build your own chatbot?

Wherever you are in the world, your local healthcare system is likely running low on, if not completely out of, personal protective equipment. These are things like masks, respirators, safety glasses, face shields, and nitrile gloves. So are the shelves of your local home centers and hardware stores and medical supply companies.\n\nWe like to make stuff. That's why we're here. The world has been crowdsourcing ways we can all chip in to help protect ourselves and others. Up until now, /r/DIY has abstained from that, because we don't have the medical knowledge and resources to vet project submissions, or the moderator bandwidth to manage the comment sections on these posts. We do, however, feel strongly that these are important projects, and we want to support those efforts. \n\nSince we can't safely do that here, today we're announcing a partnership with the [**CoronaVirus Discord**](https://discord.gg/coronavirus). They have a group of verified licensed medical professionals from around the world who have been vetting projects and collecting resources for DIYers. They have offered not only to share those resources with us, but offered a space there for discussing these types of projects, including chatting with licensed medical providers one-on-one about the projects you want to work on. You can identify them by their certifications at the end of their usernames. Check out their #covid-19-diy chat channel for details! We're encouraging everyone who wants to DIY some PPE to head over there!\n\n# Some Project Ideas\n\nHere are a few of the links they've encouraged us to share:\n\n- [Scrub cap and mask patterns](https://cvfg.org/2020/03/28/info-for-sewing-masks-and-scrub-caps/)\n- [3D printed ear savers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4187448)\n- [Hand sanitizer](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-make-hand-sanitizer)\n- [More](https://www.digitaltrends.com/health-fitness/how-to-use-your-3d-printer-to-make-face-masks-for-coronavirus-responders/)\n- [More](https://anest.ufl.edu/clinical-divisions/mask-alternative/)\n\n# Donating PPE\n\nIf you have manufactured PPE or self-made PPE, please consider sourcing them out locally. You can call your local public hospitals and ask how you can donate, as many systems have set up drives and drop-off processes to accept donations. Look to your neighbors and friend circles for healthcare workers and at-risk essential workers. Reach out and ask what you can do to help and what resources they need the most. \n\nIf your system is in a low-impact area, you can also consider donating to regional or national drives like 100 Million Mask Challenge by the American Hospital Association. \n\n## DIY PPE\n\nWe've seen how amazingly generous this community can be, and it's blown us away. So many people are producing these things not only for their own families, but to donate to the healthcare workers and others on the front lines. With PPE shortages in the news daily, our donations can have an immediate positive impact on our communities.\n\n- [100 Million Masks](https://www.100millionmasks.org/)\n- [WSJ on how to donate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-you-can-donate-protective-equipment-to-help-hospitals-fight-coronavirus-11585323638)\n\nand so many others.\n\n## Pre-manufactured PPE\n\nMany of us have PPE that we purchased before this crisis began. Maybe you bought a bulk box of dust masks and still have a few left, or have a face shield you bought for using your lathe but don't need right now.\n\nPlease consider donating extra pre-manufactured protective equipment to your local healthcare organizations! Hospitals and EMS agencies are at the top of that list. As a healthcare provider myself, I'm seeing first hand just how short we are on these essential items. Every donation will help. Call your local hospitals, talk to that nurse you know, stop by your local fire station (remember social distancing). We need your support!\n\n# Vetting Info Sources\n\nThere's a lot of information about DIYing these kinds of equipment. Some of it's good, but a lot of it is downright dangerous. Here are some tips for finding the good stuff when doing research on your own:\n\n- Be sure that any recommendations you receive are given by someone who has knowledge to speak on the subject. Has a licensed medical professional seen the design and given input? There are many designs out there that have been been looked at by professionals who have given advice about fine-tuning the designs for more safety. Is this one of those, or is it a new design that might have unsafe consequences that the designer didn't notice?\n- Beware fear mongering. Does the resource you're using tend to over-amplify the impact of the virus beyond what is stated by official channels, such as those from your government? Are they suggesting truly unusual ways of protecting yourself?\n- How widespread is the specific design? Have major news outlets linked to it and discussed its aspects? What did they say about the merits of this design specifically, versus the many unreliable designs out there?\n- Does the design discuss mistakes you could make while constructing it that would cause it to be less safe? All designs can do more harm than good if you don't create them correctly. Does the designer explain improper methods of constructing it to help you avoid those mistakes?\n\n# Thank You!\n\nThere are over 17 million of us. That is a significant number of makers, DIYers, sewers and 3D printers. Together we have the capacity to have a huge impact on the current crisis, changing the course of history and literally saving lives. At no other time in human history has the capacity to make such a difference been divested in so many people. Every single one of us can make a difference, and I'm so excited to see what you come up with.\n\nI'll see you over at the [**CoronaVirus Discord**](https://discord.gg/coronavirus)!\n\nAs always, if you have questions about /r/DIY and its moderation, you can [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/DIY).

See imgur gallery.\n* I try putting 3/8'' backer rod (smallest I could find) into the gaps. One sizable gap, the backer rod fits easily (with my cutting a length of a few inches).  Other areas, which I tried to fill to keep a 2-edge joint, are much more difficult.\n* I resort to slicing the backer-rod parallel to reduce the size of it, allowing me to fit some into the gaps.

Initially after purchasing this cedar playset I used a lot of [this oil based Rust-oleum satin sealant](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-Varathane-1-Quart-Classic-Urethane/dp/B01HU3OXTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) to cover every bit of wood on that playset. The first time through, being a really DIY noob, I used two paint brushes and it took two entire days, had dried dripping oil (which I didn't care about because my thought process was coverage/weather resistance &gt; looks).\n\nAnyways, the sealant is starting to peel really badly in some spots and underneath the wood has that old dark grey color you see on old fences. Some places also have that white mildew. We are planning on selling our house soon, and I figured this would be a good way to cover the cost of any new hardware/tools. Purchase the hardware/tools, make the playset and/or fence look as close to new as I can, and recoup the cost of the new hardware/tools in the sell of the house.\n\n**My plan for the playset is to:**\n\n1. Lightly pressure wash the playset where its peeling. Even though I have never used a pressure washer, I have read you must be very careful with the pressure washer on wood, as too much pressure causes the wood to splinter and be very rough.\n2. Masking tape / remove hardware pieces that are not wood.\n3. Using paint sprayer, apply oil based paint everywhere (? see question below) on the playset.\n4. Possibly spray paint the colored handles and thinks that arent wood.\n\n**Plan for the fence is to:**\n\n1. Note, I don't have access to sides of the fences that are shared with my neighbors, so I am not so sure if this is something I should bother with.\n2. Simply pressure wash the side of the fence I do have access to.\n3. Apply some type of sealant to the fence.\n\n**Tools I plan on purchasing pending suggestions from responses:**\n\n1. Electric pressure washer: [Stanley SHP2150](https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-SHP2150-Electric-Pressure-Washer/dp/B06XKLNN6Z/ref=sr_1_9?_encoding=UTF8&amp;c=ts&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=Pressure+Washers&amp;qid=1603643949&amp;refinements=p_85%3A2470955011%2Cp_72%3A2661618011&amp;rnid=492225011&amp;rps=1&amp;s=lawn-garden&amp;sr=1-9&amp;ts_id=552856), [Sun Joe SPX3001](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Joe-SPX3001-Electric-Pressure/dp/B00LX8Z03K/ref=sr_1_19?_encoding=UTF8&amp;c=ts&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=Pressure+Washers&amp;qid=1603643949&amp;refinements=p_85%3A2470955011%2Cp_72%3A2661618011&amp;rnid=492225011&amp;rps=1&amp;s=lawn-garden&amp;sr=1-19&amp;ts_id=552856) or something better suggested here. Prefer electric because of less maintenance, even though they generally have less pressure/spread than gas pressure washers. I don't plan on using it much besides the playset, possibly the fence, and occasionally future jobs like cleaning the driveway. Would prefer not to spend more than $300 on this.\n2. Paint sprayer: [YATTICH Paint Sprayer](https://www.amazon.com/YATTICH-Electric-Patterns-Furniture-YT-191/dp/B083CZ6ZQ5/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=paint+sprayer&amp;qid=1603641698&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-5), or something better suggested here that is less than $100\n3.

Potentially for fence as well if I decide to do that.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. What is the difference between a oil based paint and oil based sealant? I have been told I should use a oil based paint.

I applied 2 cartridges worth of silicon wood glue approved for outdoor underwater, high-temperature use in between all of the planks.  \nIt's being held together by 4 steel ropes tensioned with the wire fence tensioners.  \nI coated it with flax oil.  \n\n\n[bottom](https://preview.redd.it/e23107g3ryd51.jpg?width=5504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=521a5b779ee18683e2cf0ea78ca528ab965b1228)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0y60fbpzqyd51.jpg?width=5504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=460c7cb29678e9f52b60276b8bcc287d6acfdc0d\n\n[this one broke..](https://preview.redd.it/81m5hoocryd51.jpg?width=5504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f62454327a7b646f6e36b08e64077b5d7609244)\n\n  \nThen I coiled 2 spirals (to have more heat exchange surface) out of 22mm soft copper pipes (about 20m of it together). Before coiling, I packed it with salt to avoid pinching (getting it out was a hassle but I guess it was worth it). And I soft welded them together on both ends (watch the video). This, however, is a part I'm not too sure about. I did it so I wouldn't have to drill 4 holes in the tub instead of 2 (and because the part that's connecting the tub to the pipe and seals the hole was like  $ 30/piece)  but it might be causing inefficiency in the natural convection - the pressure coming from one pipe to another rather than just upwards ^(what do you think?). The top hole (where the hot water comes out) is drilled about 30cm below the final water surface.  \n\n\n[the top pipe is isolated to prevent heat loss.

I've placed a sheet of metal (from an old computer case)  between the coil and chimney hole so the fire wouldn't go straight in the chimney but rather all around the interior - leaving more heat.  \n\n\n[dry test without mortar \\(it doesn't have a foundation.

Whatever your layout is, the manner continues to be the same.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Fixture for the Groove\n\nWe created a fixture for cutting the groove in a nice, immediately line with a handheld router. At this point, you should decide which face of the wood is nicer, so you can cut the groove on the opposite side. You may additionally have a different manner to do this, or other gear that may be used. With the gear we've got here, this changed into the quality alternative for us.  \n\n\nThis simple fixture is crafted from some MDF board and is sized to our router. We used a desk saw to reduce out the hole in the MDF board, but a Jigsaw or Bandsaw may paintings better (and be safer!).\n\n### Step 3: Cut the Groove\n\nUsing the fixture and router, we reduce the groove inside the again of the knife holder. Make sure to set the intensity nicely to depart the favored thickness of wood. We left 1/16\" thickness of ultimate wood.  \n\n\nThis is where a few technical facts approximately magnets comes into play, but it's far simple. The much less material left, the smaller (and cheaper) magnets you can use. The more cloth, the stronger the magnets will need to be to correctly hold the knives. We assume 1/16\" of material left is a superb thickness. This means we set the router intensity to 11/16\".\n\n### Step 4: Route the Other Edges and Sand\n\nAfter cutting the groove, we desired to have a nice fillet on the other edges, so we used the router for this. Again, your design is probably different, ours is quite simple. We then sanded the groove and piece smooth. At this point, all major cuts at the block are finished, so that you can sand to complete as well.\n\n### Step 5: Insert Disc Neodymium Magnets!\n\nThis subsequent step is our favorite part, placing the magnets! We placed the block on a steel cookie sheet, to help maintain the magnets in vicinity at the same time as setting them into the groove. We positioned paper in between to protect our finishing sand. Our groove is 1/2\" extensive and we used [1/2\" x 3/16\" magnets](https://magnetshub.com/collections/disc/products/100-pcs-disc-neodymium-magnets-size-12-3mm-n52-nickelni-cu-ni)  \n\n\nThe orientation of the magnets is important. They have to be positioned in alternating polarities. If you have a look at the magnets, the poles could be North, South, North, South, etc. The edges attract on this orientation, so you will understand if they are being installed right. If you try and place them facet by aspect and the magnets repel, genuinely flip one of the magnets so it attracts.  \n\n\nNote: Neodymium magnets are very hard and brittle. If they're allowed to slam together, they could probably break. This process must be carried out carefully. The steel cookie sheet clearly helps keep the magnets down in order that they do not slam to each other.\n\n### Step 6: Adhere the Magnets in Place\n\nIn this last step, we adhere the magnets in vicinity even as still at the steel sheet. While many different sorts of adhesives will work well, we used a silicone adhesive. Make sure to cover all of the magnets along the whole groove. Don't be afraid to be generous with the adhesive!  \n\n\nAfter the adhesive dries, you can finish the block with something finish you choose (oil, stain, wax, etc).\n\n### Step 7: Install the Block\n\nOnce the adhesive is dry and your block is finished, its time\u00a0**to put in**\u00a0the block!

Stained Glass Succulent Tutorial- Since I have not been able to find a free tutorial on how to make a stained glass succulent here\u2019s one I\u2019ve made one. I\u2019ll detail the steps and provide a YouTube link in the comments! /!/ [How to Make a Stained Glass Succulent](https://youtu.be/FqatZIQP97o)\n\n[Finished Product](https://imgur.com/gallery/3sp377F)\n\n\nHi there again- to begin here\u2019s a YouTube link to the video for a visual tutorial on the entire process save for the drafting. \n\nTools needed:\nDrafting- Avery printable adhesive cardstock, pencil, sharpies, scissors\n\nCutting Glass- pistol grip glass cutter, glass cutting oil, breaking pliers, grozing pliers\n\nFinishing Edges- Glass grinding table, (optional) dremel with a diamond bit or silicone carbide bit, soap, water and a clean cloth\n\nFoiling, Soldering, and Assembling- Copper foil tape, burnishing tools, flux, 60/40 lead solder, 100 watt Soldering Iron\n\n\nTo begin I sketch three different size succulent/leaf petals on Avery\u2019s printable adhesive cardstock with a pencil. Once I feel the shapes are uniform I cut each one out and trace each of the three sizes eight times. I cut these out and arrange them in clean glass, sticky side down\n\nI then score the glass using the glass cutter and use my breaking pliers to gently squeeze on the score I\u2019ve created, this will break the glass along the score but may take some coaxing by squeezing the other end and alternating until the glass gives. I score and break any larger pieces off of each petal and then use my grozing pliers to nibble away at the glass until I\u2019m close enough to the stencil to grind. \n\nI use my grinding table to smooth the edges up to the stencil and then I peel the adhesive sticker off and wash and dry thoroughly- this is important because the copper foiling in the next step will not adhere to dust or water or oil from your fingers (wear latex gloves for extra caution). \n\nI then lay the foil tape along the edge of each petal and burnish the edge (cold press the copper foil to lay it down smooth), I then fold the sides over and burnish the small strip on either side of the glass piece. Once smooth flux the foil thoroughly while you allow your soldering iron to heat. Once fluxed use the soldering iron and solder to lay a thin layer of solder onto the foil, repeat on all exposed foil on each piece- fluxing when it won\u2019t stick. Smooth your solder for a tidy look and now we assemble. \n\nBeginning with your eight largest pieces, add a solder tack to a corner where two petals will meet. Slightly raise and angle each piece up and inward to create your bottom layer of petals. Now begin the second layer by tacking a petal on and working in a circle to add the other pieces. Do a third layer with the eight smallest pieces angling your petals steeper with each layer. Create a \u201ccenter\u201d for your succulent by filling with solder and smoothing! \n\nNow you have a nice stained glass succulent you can use as decoration or as a small jewelry holder. \n\nAny questions, comments or constructive criticisms of my technique are greatly appreciated and welcomed!

This was my first shot at designing something so complex from the ground up and building it all myself. I'd only done very simple projects before, screwing a few 2x4's together and such.\n\nDecided to build 20\"x48\" workbench with a lower shelf and upper shelf that would measure 60\" high.

The only exception were for the 60\\\\\" cuts, because those didn't have to be exactly 60\\\\\", as long as I had 4 pieces that were about 60\\\\\" that were the same length.](https://preview.redd.it/n5eajsu9d3b51.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1ff6a5419510b184c483401f1c4b466b566a1f5)\n\n \n\n[ Here's my initial haul. That's 11x 8 foot pieces of Douglas Fir 2x4's. I needed to have the shop make one cut in each one to fit it in my car, so I looked at my Google Sheets and just picked the longest cut for each 8 foot piece. I also found an old peg board that were exactly the measurements I needed at my mom's house. She used to blow up balloons to stick in the holds so my friends and I could throw darts at them at my birthday parties and stuff. I decided to keep it exactly the way it was with all the old balloon fragments and stuff on it, kind of a nostalgia thing. ](https://preview.redd.it/uv7mo43ub3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5992d11956a3175d37442b5f460fdeb67337669)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's the pile of 2x4s after I got them cut. I brought everything to my friend's house and used his miter saw to cut everything. I really wanted to make sure each piece was the exact same size as the other pieces of the same size. I know that I am prone to error and can make mistakes measuring by fractions of an inch, so instead of measuring each cut using a measuring tape, I would measure, for example, one 10\\\\\" piece, cut it, and then use that piece to measure out cuts for the remaining 5x 10\\\\\" pieces. It took a lot of time and patience, but in the end I'm glad I was so careful making sure all the pieces of the same length were EXACTLY the same length.](https://preview.redd.it/jencb3pbe3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a250b9f89da256bed8064d58066fae2628ed503)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here is the frame for the work bench table top, which I'll attach a piece of plywood onto to serve as a work surface.

I marked out where I wanted the size 10 3\\\\\" screws to go with a pen, and then clamped everything together so that the frame would at least somewhat hold its shape as I drilled my pilot holes using a 9\\/64\\\\\" bit. Then, I used my impact driver to drill in two screws per connection point, making sure to check the squareness of the corners after I screwed in each screw. This was done very carefully and was very time consuming, but I ended up with a very square frame so it was worth it.](https://preview.redd.it/vcmaswhud3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d48a366b601189f555ac2e023e7fc762932d242)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I did the exact same drill with the bottom shelf, being very careful to measure the squareness of everything before clamping it and screwing it together. Two 3\\\\\" screws per connection point and checking the squareness after every screw. I wanted to make the bottom shelf recessed a little bit compared to the table top so that I could easily sit at the work bench with a stool and store it underneath the table as well.

After completing the frames for the table top and the bottom shelf, I decided to connect legs to the table top as a next step so that I could have a surface to complete the rest of the cutting and assembly. Here is a leg being attached. Legs were 36\\\\\" long. Used a square and clamp to try and get everything as square as possible, same drill as the table top and the bottom shelf with checking the squareness and drilling pilot holes. However, I used 3 screws in the shape of a triangle \\(think play button orientation\\) to attach the legs, being careful to avoid the screws that were already in the frame itself. It was very important for me to get the legs as square as possible because I didn't want a wobbly table. Before and after every screw, I checked the squareness of the leg to the floor, leg to the frame, etc. ](https://preview.redd.it/rnklt9vtg3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b6474d5d560d62e8f847ecad6e81fe81e6a77c6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's what it looked like after connecting the four legs to the table top. Rock solid and not wobbly at all. See how the legs stick out a bit from the sides of the table top frame? That will play into how I cut the plywood because I wanted the plywood surface to stick out a little bit past the frame to cover the table legs. It also gives me the added advantage of having another surface to clamp onto. ](https://preview.redd.it/0hyfcemkh3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=557fb92cac006262425378b961bd040f686456af)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ I bought 2 sheets of plywood from a lumber shop - 2'x4'x3\\/4\\\\\" for the table top, and 2'x4'x1\\/2\\\\\" for the bottom and top shelves. I used a 50\\\\\" saw guide from Harbor Freight to get everything lined up to cut down to size, making sure to leave enough room to cover the table legs sticking out. Basically, I drew a line where I wanted to make the cut, and then measured 4 inches over from that line to place my saw guide. Lining up my circular saw with the saw guide exactly 4 inches over allowed my blade to line up perfectly with my cut line. I was able to use both the saw guide and the drawn line to make my cut as perfectly as I could. Also, I made sure to use my 4 ah battery instead of my 1.5 ah, - I definitely noticed a difference in power.](https://preview.redd.it/npo7wngxh3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f7bc2a35049bfb00420f6d475ba1b679f3594a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[After I cut the plywood for the table top, I used size 9 1 1\\/2\\\\\" screws \\(the store didn't have 1 5\\/8\\\\\"\\) to attach the plywood to the frame. I used the piece of plywood I had just cut off, measured out even distances between the 4 screws I would use per line, and used a square with the plywood piece to mark out exactly where I wanted each screw to go, making sure each one would go through the plywood and into a 2x4. I used the same 9\\/64\\\\\" drill bit to drill pilot holes before driving in the screws with an impact driver.  I found that I broke a couple of the 1 1\\/2\\\\\" screws while driving them, I think I could've gone a little slower to keep the screws from heating up too much. I found they heat up really fast - I burned my arm on one when I rested on it.  ](https://preview.redd.it/1zari5zgi3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c8b159dbc6ab976efcfcd8e826435c5258327b9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Now that I had another surface to work on, I decided to put the top shelf together.

Two screws per connection point. ](https://preview.redd.it/kahh10w8j3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21718a398b9ae4cfc5ac202cd415391235215112)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Did the same drill I did with the table top with the top shelf, connecting four 60\\\\\" legs onto the frame by using the square and clamp.

I realized that the middle leg of the work bench doesn't really do anything if it extends all the way to the ground and it looks really weird having 6 legs touching the floor, so I used a reciprocating saw to saw it off right past the table top. I used a square to mark off where I was going to make the cut to make sure I didn't cut into the bottom shelf itself when making this cut.](https://preview.redd.it/1htoj9g2k3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=906abac9df6386b919a45324afd18c038a923303)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here is the work bench at the end of day 2, sitting in its nook. I didn't take pictures of how I attached the bottom shelf, but I needed my roommate to come down and hold it in place while I attached it to the legs. I used some leftover plywood, measured out 19 inches in length, and then used that plywood to serve as a support for the bottom shelf \\(along with my roommates' hands\\) while screwing in the shelf. It actually took quite a bit of wiggling to get the shelf in there to screw in. I probably should have attached it before I attached the top shelf. I made the top shelf 19\\\\\" off the ground so I could fit my shop vac under there - you'll see later.](https://preview.redd.it/1737jx5ck3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feaa6459c4418fc1e23e9f2b4f42e22686f37513)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Start of day 3, first thing I did was put the pegboard on. I just screwed it in with 1 1\\/2\\\\\" screws into the back of the frame of the whole workbench. I basically used the holes of the pegboard itself to mark out where I wanted the screws to go through to attach to the frame, and then put screws through those holes into the 2x4 beneath. Basically, I used the pegboard holes as pilot holes for the pegboard itself, and didn't have to drill any new holes into the pegboard. I then used an oscillating multi-tool with the plugne blade attachment to cut out the hole in the pegboard for the outlet. I could've done a better job on that. What I did was push the table against the wall and then use a pen to poke the holes in the pegboard to see whether it was outlet or drywall underneath. Then I just cut hole to hole using the multi-tool. I could've done with a slightly smaller hole to fit the size of the outlet better. I also put in a backing board 2x4 at the bottom, figured it'd be good to have a piece like that back there to push things against later. The workbench was like this for about a week while I waited for a few things to arrive from Amazon: a power strip, shop light, and peg board hooks.](https://preview.redd.it/tz52fqtsk3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d232062c548ee3be7f6901c8308251ff64aa3bbe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Got a shop stool from Harbor Freight that fits under the work bench. This picture was after I put in a bunch of the peg board hooks I got. This was a regrettable purchase from Amazon. A lot of the hooks were bent in the wrong way and the plastic bins didn't fit into my pegboard at all. I had to drill holes in them and hang them off of hooks for them to work. I also saw a pegboard hook set at Harbor Freight yesterday for 1\\/3 of what I paid. Much regret. I cut out some of the 2x4's of the frame of the top shelf to nestle the 30\\\\\" LED shop light I bought into it to try and get it out of the way a bit.

of the garage. i had recently just gotten a bunch of tools and wanted to put them to use to build a spot to organize them as well. this was my first shot at designing something so complex from the ground up and building it all myself. i'd only done very simple projects before, screwing a few 2x4's together and such.\n\ndecided to build 20\"x48\" workbench with a lower shelf and upper shelf that would measure 60\" high. needed to make it exactly 48\" wide so that it'd fit in a little nook in my garage between my breaker box and where my stairs jut into the garage.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[this was the plan i drew up on my ipad using an apple pencil. i initially tried using sketch up to make a rendering of the work bench but i couldn't figure it out and gave up. i did a wrong calculation for the top shelf plywood, it should be 10\\\\\"x48\\\\\" instead of 10\\\\\"x45\\\\\". learned a valuable lesson in measuring twice, cutting once.](https://preview.redd.it/4wvulpwfc3b51.png?width=211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a677621cfe6ee74ebe619c2d86bbd3c9cd3191d7)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[i then used this google sheets to estimate what cuts and lengths i needed to cut out of each piece of 2x4, as well as how much plywood wood and how many of what length of screw i would need. i initially forgot to take into account the width of the blade of the miter saw i'd be using to cut the wood, so i had to re-configure the 2x4 cuts to leave at least a few inches extra in each 8 foot 2x4. the only exception were for the 60\\\\\" cuts, because those didn't have to be exactly 60\\\\\", as long as i had 4 pieces that were about 60\\\\\" that were the same length.](https://preview.redd.it/n5eajsu9d3b51.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1ff6a5419510b184c483401f1c4b466b566a1f5)\n\n \n\n[ here's my initial haul. that's 11x 8 foot pieces of douglas fir 2x4's. i needed to have the shop make one cut in each one to fit it in my car, so i looked at my google sheets and just picked the longest cut for each 8 foot piece. i also found an old peg board that were exactly the measurements i needed at my mom's house. she used to blow up balloons to stick in the holds so my friends and i could throw darts at them at my birthday parties and stuff. i decided to keep it exactly the way it was with all the old balloon fragments and stuff on it, kind of a nostalgia thing.

brought everything to my friend's house and used his miter saw to cut everything. i really wanted to make sure each piece was the exact same size as the other pieces of the same size. i know that i am prone to error and can make mistakes measuring by fractions of an inch, so instead of measuring each cut using a measuring tape, i would measure, for example, one 10\\\\\" piece, cut it, and then use that piece to measure out cuts for the remaining 5x 10\\\\\" pieces. it took a lot of time and patience, but in the end i'm glad i was so careful making sure all the pieces of the same length were exactly the same length.](https://preview.redd.it/jencb3pbe3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a250b9f89da256bed8064d58066fae2628ed503)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[here is the frame for the work bench table top, which i'll attach a piece of plywood onto to serve as a work surface. first, i laid out all of the pieces to resemble the shape i needed. then, i used the speed square to make sure every single corner was as square as possible. i marked out where i wanted the size 10 3\\\\\" screws to go with a pen, and then clamped everything together so that the frame would at least somewhat hold its shape as i drilled my pilot holes using a 9\\/64\\\\\" bit. then, i used my impact driver to drill in two screws per connection point, making sure to check the squareness of the corners after i screwed in each screw. this was done very carefully and was very time consuming, but i ended up with a very square frame so it was worth it.](https://preview.redd.it/vcmaswhud3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d48a366b601189f555ac2e023e7fc762932d242)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[i did the exact same drill with the bottom shelf, being very careful to measure the squareness of everything before clamping it and screwing it together. two 3\\\\\" screws per connection point and checking the squareness after every screw. i wanted to make the bottom shelf recessed a little bit compared to the table top so that i could easily sit at the work bench with a stool and store it underneath the table as well. i gave myself about 8\\\\\" of space for my legs when i sit and to store a stool. this was the last thing i did on day 1.](https://preview.redd.it/cguo6yqdg3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9fe62ec7f1dddf775cd44ebdb556aba8f4da23e)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[start of day 2. after completing the frames for the table top and the bottom shelf, i decided to connect legs to the table top as a next step so that i could have a surface to complete the rest of the cutting and assembly. here is a leg being attached. legs were 36\\\\\" long. used a square and clamp to try and get everything as square as possible, same drill as the table top and the bottom shelf with checking the squareness and drilling pilot holes. however, i used 3 screws in the shape of a triangle \\(think play button orientation\\) to attach the legs, being careful to avoid the screws that were already in the frame itself. it was very important for me to get the legs as square as possible because i didn't want a wobbly table. before and after every screw, i checked the squareness of the leg to the floor, leg to the frame, etc.

four legs to the table top. rock solid and not wobbly at all. see how the legs stick out a bit from the sides of the table top frame? that will play into how i cut the plywood because i wanted the plywood surface to stick out a little bit past the frame to cover the table legs. it also gives me the added advantage of having another surface to clamp onto.

shop - 2'x4'x3\\/4\\\\\" for the table top, and 2'x4'x1\\/2\\\\\" for the bottom and top shelves. i used a 50\\\\\" saw guide from harbor freight to get everything lined up to cut down to size, making sure to leave enough room to cover the table legs sticking out. basically, i drew a line where i wanted to make the cut, and then measured 4 inches over from that line to place my saw guide. lining up my circular saw with the saw guide exactly 4 inches over allowed my blade to line up perfectly with my cut line. i was able to use both the saw guide and the drawn line to make my cut as perfectly as i could. also, i made sure to use my 4 ah battery instead of my 1.5 ah, - i definitely noticed a difference in power.](https://preview.redd.it/npo7wngxh3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f7bc2a35049bfb00420f6d475ba1b679f3594a)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[after i cut the plywood for the table top, i used size 9 1 1\\/2\\\\\" screws \\(the store didn't have 1 5\\/8\\\\\"\\) to attach the plywood to the frame. i used the piece of plywood i had just cut off, measured out even distances between the 4 screws i would use per line, and used a square with the plywood piece to mark out exactly where i wanted each screw to go, making sure each one would go through the plywood and into a 2x4. i used the same 9\\/64\\\\\" drill bit to drill pilot holes before driving in the screws with an impact driver.  i found that i broke a couple of the 1 1\\/2\\\\\" screws while driving them, i think i could've gone a little slower to keep the screws from heating up too much. i found they heat up really fast - i burned my arm on one when i rested on it.

decided to put the top shelf together. here's a better shot of how i clamped the pieces together to make the frame before i started drilling pilot holes and putting the screws in. again, took my time

is a picture from a little later in the process. i realized that the middle leg of the work bench doesn't really do anything if it extends all the way to the ground and it looks really weird having 6 legs touching the floor, so i used a reciprocating saw to saw it off right past the table top. i used a square to mark off where i was going to make the cut to make sure i didn't cut into the bottom shelf itself when making this cut.](https://preview.redd.it/1htoj9g2k3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=906abac9df6386b919a45324afd18c038a923303)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[here is the work bench at the end of day 2, sitting in its nook. i didn't take pictures of how i attached the bottom shelf, but i needed my roommate to come down and hold it in place while i attached it to the legs. i used some leftover plywood, measured out 19 inches in length, and then used that plywood to serve as a support for the bottom shelf \\(along with my roommates' hands\\) while screwing in the shelf. it actually took quite a bit of wiggling to get the shelf in there to screw in. i probably should have attached it before i attached the top shelf. i made the top shelf 19\\\\\" off the ground so i could fit my shop vac under there - you'll see later.](https://preview.redd.it/1737jx5ck3b51.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feaa6459c4418fc1e23e9f2b4f42e22686f37513)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[start of day 3, first thing i did was put the pegboard on. i just screwed it in with 1 1\\/2\\\\\" screws into the back of the frame of the whole workbench. i basically used the holes of the pegboard itself to mark out where i wanted the screws to go through to attach to the frame, and then put screws through those holes into the 2x4 beneath. basically, i used the pegboard holes as pilot holes for the pegboard itself, and didn't have to drill any new holes into the pegboard. i then used an oscillating multi-tool with the plugne blade attachment to cut out the hole in the pegboard for the outlet. i could've done a better job on that. what i did was push the table against the wall and then use a pen to poke the holes in the pegboard to see whether it was outlet or drywall underneath. then i just cut hole to hole using the multi-tool. i could've done with a slightly smaller hole to fit the size of the outlet better. i also put in a backing board 2x4 at the bottom, figured it'd be good to have a piece like that back there to push things against later. the workbench was like this for about a week while i waited for a few things to arrive from amazon: a power strip, shop light, and peg board hooks.](https://preview.redd.it/tz52fqtsk3b51.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d232062c548ee3be7f6901c8308251ff64aa3bbe)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[ got a shop stool from harbor freight

i paid. much regret. i cut out some of the 2x4's of the frame of the top shelf to nestle the 30\\\\\" led shop light i bought into it to try and get it out of the way a bit. it didn't really work that

The easiest way would be to buy a new mainboard (micro ATX or mini ITX) along with the case which would add 100-150\u20ac to the bill which is unacceptable for an apprentice with a monthly wage of 500\u20ac. So, since I had a bunch of free time at home due to corona, I wanted to make one myself because \"how hard can it be?\" (foreshadowing: harder than I hoped, easier than I feared). This was my first time making a DIY project out of wood so I had no idea what to expect.\n\nPlanning:\n\nI used the freeware program \"Dia\" to make a few plans to estimate the best size and layout of the build. I wanted to make it easy to build a computer in, be either as small as possible or moderately sized while well implementable into room decoration (I chose latter by making a cube to put things on), and not an eyesore. Eventually I ended up with the design in the photos, where I place a middle plate on top of the power supply unit (PSU) and have the main components on top of the plate and the storage drives and all cables below it.\n\nGetting the materials:\n\nI went to the local hardware store and took a look at the plywood planks. Immediately I feared that the 5mm thick boards I wanted to make it from wouldn't be stable enough. Instead, I went for the 10mm thick ones. Sadly, the CNC service of the store was closed due to corona so I had to load the 1200 x 600 mm board into my tiny ford fiesta. My brother let me use his jigsaw to cut the boards to the sizes I planned them to have. I also bought some screws, angles and nuts.\n\nA little disclaimer:\n\nI didn't have any type of saw of my own except for a swiss army knife. I wanted to buy things but the corona situation got worse so the hardware store was closed the day after I bought the wood. It only opened after I was finished. As I didn't want to bother my brother again with tool demands, I decided to suck it up and make the whole thing with only the following tools: A cordless drill with bits for different sized holes and screws, a round file, a flat file and the swiss army knife with a tiny saw of 10cm length. This will probably make some of you cringe but that were the tools I had available so that's what I used. I also used parts of a 15 years old PC as references.\n\nBuilding it:\n\nFirst I screwed the bottom, back and the side panels together with angles. Probably not the most elegant or comfortable solution but it allowed me to place the old parts in the case and see exactly where the positions were on all sides of the case. First I noticed that the old mainboard spacer screws are the exact same size as the holes in the PSU (3mm thick) so I screwed them in, painted the top ends with a text marker and pushed the PSU into the wood where I wanted the PSU to sit. This created a print of the marker on the wood which determined where the holes for the screws had to be. The mainboard spacers are 5mm long so I just screwed two spacers into each other and screw the board in. After testing that, I removed the PSU again and drew shapes with a pencil that resembled the shape of the PSU ventilation, both at the backside and on the bottom. Used the drill to make holes and the files to expand it (again, these were the tools I had and the 10cm saw was pretty useless)\n\nAfter that was done, I screwed the PSU in again and put the middle plate on top of it, Held it in place with a weight and put the angle on the underside of it. With the marker I marked the spots to screw in the holes for the 4 angles the middle plate will rest on, took everything out again, screwed the angles in, put everything in to test it again, used the marker and drilled through the plate completely at the 4 points where the angles and the plate will be screwed together. I placed nuts on the angle's downsides and hot-glued them on. Tested again with the screws. So far no problems.\n\nSame Marker method used to make the holes for the mainboard spacers. However, since the 3mm thick holes only need to get 3mm into the plate I had to first hammer the spacers into the wood and then hotglue them so they won't move or come off.\n\nI used the marker method to determine where the first hole for the I/O had to go. The connectors on the mainboard are not standardized so the one I'm using has different connectors than the reference. However, the I/O Shield's outer measures are standardized. I used position of the connector I marked and held the shield where it had to go later. With a pencil I drew the size of the shield and made the hole a tiiiiiny bit smaller so that the IO shield had to fit tightly without being able to wiggle out of the hole.\n\nNext was the graphics card. In order to give it more stability, the bent part of the board's IO shield has to lay on top of the wood, ideally being screwed into it. This was a bit of a problem because the wood isn't allowed to cover the IO itself which means the wooden rest has to be smaller than 5mm, making it less stable. In the end, 5mm is still stable enough to hold the card, but I wouldn't be comfortable with it being thinner.\n\nAfter that, there came the ventilation holes. I won't go into details about airflow and why I used the exact spots I used, but I cut out a 120mm round hole on the backside as exhaust and on the (from the front) right side I made some smaller holes in an even pattern for a backup fan in case the main exhaust isn't enough (it is though so that was unnecessary). The pattern was made by first drawing the round inside of the fan with a pencil and then using a ruler to make a point every 15mm. The holes are 8mm thick. Then I made 4mm thick holes in the middle of the space between the first holes because I felt that I had wasted too much space with the gaps in between the holes.\n\nSame procedure for the left side, however, I wanted to use 2 140mm diameter fans next to each other so I expanded the pattern.\n\nMaking it not an eyesore:\n\nI bought vinyl wrap online to make it look less wooden. The foils are Carbon and metallic gold. I used a calculator to make it so the space underneath the golden stripe was exactly half of the space above the stripe. This interferred with the exhaust pattern but I am okay with that. However, before applying the foil, I wanted to even out the parts where I worked unprecisely. So I used wood putty. I smeared it on the edges and rubbed the excess stuff off with sanding paper. Then I spraypainted the whole wooden structure black so imperfections in the application of the foil are less visible.\n\nIt was my first time applying the vinyl foil and at first it was a bit hard. I used a hairdryer for heating the wrap and a plastic spatula to push the air out. It is a bit hard to describe the process so if you want to do something with vinyl wrap, please watch a youtube tutorial before. I removed the foil that was on top of the exhaust fans with a box cutter. In the end, I ran out of vinyl wrap before being able to fully envelope the backside. However, as that side will forever face a wall, I don't intend on buying another 15\u20ac of wrap just to use a tenth of it so I left it that way.\n\nIn the end I swapped out the old computer parts with the new ones. There were a few holes that didn't match up because of old vs new standards, but that wasn't a problem and I just took things out, drilled and put it in again.\n\nEnd:\n\nIt was a lot of work and my biceps probably grew a bit from all the filing, and it isn't perfect, but I am proud of it as my first real DIY project.\n\nA good pc case is around 80-100\u20ac and I would have probably needed a new mainboard for another 100\u20ac. This one here cost me around 55\u20ac in material so disregarding the work hours, I saved \\~130\u20ac.", "link":

We ended up with 23 drawers in the kitchen, so **right around $500 in glides.**\n\nDoor hinges were either full or partial overlay Blumotion Clip Top 110 degree face frame's. Between $6-12/each depending on sales, etc. We have 20 doors in the kitchen, **so about $350 in hinges.**\n\nAll handles were Top Knobs from [Build.com](https://Build.com) and averaged $15/ea. We had 50 in the kitchen, **so right about $750 in handles.**\n\nThe inside of all cabinets and all sides of the drawers were covered in one coat of Woca Diamond Oil Natural, to match what went on our red oak floors. That s\\*it is expensive and ended up being **about $500 for Woca alone**. Add in **about $30 in cloth, rags, gloves** to put it on (everything is flammable after coated in Woca, so you end up just throwing it away).\n\nAll door/drawer fronts got 2 coats of SE Urethane Paint on top of one coat of primer. We had some sales locally, **so the paint/rollers/trays was only $160**.\n\nOther elements included a Rev a shelf **mixer lift for $160**, **hidden corner pull-out for $300.**\n\nAs for tools, we did all this with a 10 year old Rigid 10\" job-site table saw and a few new blades, a nicer/newer Makita 10\" dual-tilt sliding miter saw, Makita track saw w/ 8' track ($600 off Amazon), misc drills/drivers, Kreg pocket-hole jig/shelf pin jig, Bosch plunge router (only used for bar door channels).\n\nAll in all, this took about 6 weeks, working 10 hour days on the weekend and 2-3 hours 2-3 nights a week.

The knot roughly in the centre was what I wanted.\n\nStep two - Drilling, with a 6mm drill bit to get rid of most of the wood in each square, and then taking to it with hammer and chisel. Had to be careful to not go too far over, otherwise the resin would spill between the squares and ruin it.\n\nStep three - Pouring the resin, I used Protite Clear Casting resin, from the local hardware store. It's not the greatest quality as it shrinks quite a lot as it sets. I will be using a different one next time. I also used sillicone around the outside of the board to ensure the overspill of resin wouldn't go any where.\n\nStep four - Waiting. I let the resin set for 2 weeks as I have been impatient before, and it doesnt sand properly, if it's not properly set.\n\nStep five - Sanding, I started with an 80 grit belt on an ozito belt sander, then to a 120 grit belt. after that I went to a Bosch Blue orbital sander, starting at 120 grit again and gradually upping it until about 800 grit.\n\nStep six - Filling the gaps, I couldn't let go of the gaps that were left between the resin and the wood after sanding, so I got some wood coloured builders putty and smeared it into all the gaps, and then sanded back after 24 hours. This time I didn't go to quite as high a grit as I wanted the resin to stay a little smokey to cover some of the imperfections underneath.\n\nStep seven - Cutting the boarder. I got 90 degree Steel angle, 40mm x 40mm and cut 45 degree angles with an angle grinder. I cut the top at 45 first, and straight down the 'Vertical' side, ground it back with a sanding disc to the 45 degree. I made sure to make each side a little smaller that they should be, because I knew I could fill in their gaps. I also drilled 4mm holes in the boarder and lined the holes up with the edges of the squares, and then counter sunk the holes so the screws would sit flush\n\nStep eight - Oiled the wood. I used decking oil to finish the wood and resin. It seems to have helped clear up the resin, and really made the grain of the wood pop. I left it over night to soak.\n\nStep nine - Filling in more gaps, the boarder. I put all the center screws in all the way,  I was going to use sillicone, but worried the paint wouldn't stick to silicone properly, so I opted for the builders putty. After filling the gaps on the boarder, the boarder can't be removed.\n\nStep ten - More sanding, I sanded back the corners of the boarder to get rid of the excess builders putty. I had screws in all the centre holes all the way in, and the rest of the screws in only a little bit, as I plan to remove the screws after spray painting the boarder to give the boarder a more authentic metal look.\n\nStep eleven - Spraying, I used Charcoal Hammer tone spray paint. and packaging tape to cover the centre of the board. I used a grey primer first to make sure the paint would stick properly, and to help hide the builders putty. I used a fair few coats of paint which made the builders putty in the corners look like weld joins.\n\nStep twelve - Peel the tape off the centre of the board. this was really satisfying and the result was wonderful.\n\nStep thirteen - replaced all the screws in the boarder.\n\nStep fourteen - The Pieces, I used 16mm steel tube for the pawns, and cut each of them with an angle grinder, which I found really hard to get straight. I used a piece of paper wrapped around the steel pipe at the measurement I wanted, and made sure the paper lined up when wrapped around the pipe, and marked the line with a permanent marker. To the the pieces to stand more straight, I used my belt sander and 120 grit paper to get rid of uneven angles.\n\nStep fifteen - Same as step fourteen, except with 20mm steen pipe, and I used a square to mark where to cut, and spun the pipe on the square and marked roughly every 2mm with dots. I managed to cut these a lot more square than the pawns.\n\nStep sixteen - Shaping the Class pieces. I used an ozito rotary tool to cut each of the shapes of the class pieces. I used a small grinding disc, and went through about 20 of them as they don't last long. I used a square and lots of dots to mark out what I wanted to cut, and then I used 120 grit sandpaper to knock off any sharp edges.\n\nStep seventeen - Painting, I used a grey primer on all of the pieces, and did two coats over about an hour. Then for the 'White' pieces, I used Silver Hammertone spray paint, and Charcoal Hammer tone for the 'Black' Pieces.\n\nStep eighteen - Let it dry.\n\nStep nineteen - Enjoy a game of chess.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/g14kin/diy_hand_crafted_chess_set/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "DIY", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "-----> diy !!!  hand crafted chess set /!/ https://preview.redd.it/tpnu56662ss41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3598087e22b1ded34604b8cdf4442c0bb3dde560\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tqkerd4](https://imgur.com/a/tqkerd4)\n\ni made a chess set, learnt a lot of things along the way, and keen to make a second one soon.\n\nit's roughly 400mm x 400mm\n\ni'm an electrician by trade, so i don't have many wood working tools, but i'm slowly building them up over time.\n\npower tools used -

This link is for reference, but if you have an Ace Hardware near you, you can get the four screws and nylon lock nuts to match for less than 2 bucks instead of having to buy a pack. I swear that every single time I need something small like this, Home Depot and Lowe's never have what I need, but Ace Hardware does every single time, AND they know exactly where to take me in the store as well as exactly what I'm asking about, even when I don't.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n1. Throw away the mounting hardware that comes with the pedal set you got, trust me. I tried that hardware to avoid drilling, but the cover will eventually slip off.  \n2. Take your drill and drill holes in the four corners of the pedal. You will find it a lot easier if you can center-punch each drill location first to keep the drill head in place, and you may want some help holding the pedal down a bit so you can both fit the drill in the working area and have the proper angle to apply force. Each hole took a bit of time and effort for me, and a lot of sweat and curse words while doing everything myself.  \n3. Insert the bolts into the four holes of the pedal pad/cover, and through the holes in the pedal, then put the lock nuts on the screws hand-tight so nothing slips off.  \n4. Insert the rubber spacer block between the pedal pad/cover and the clutch pedal itself, then tighten the bottom bolts until the cover is just touching the spacer block.  \n5. Tighten the top screws until the top of the cover is just touching the spacer block. From here you will need to center the spacer block underneath the pedal cover, then tighten the screws bit by bit until the pedal cover doesn't wiggle around. FYI, my pedal cover has not moved/slipped at all in the several months since installing it.  \n6. Take it for a test drive and see how it feels. If it's not enough of a height difference for you, you can try longer bolts and either stack two spacer blocks or stand two on their sides under the pedal cover to find your sweet spot.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nThe worst part of the whole install is the contortions you have to do to get under the dash and do everything. However, once you have the height adjustment you need for the clutch pedal, you will thank yourself every time you drive.
