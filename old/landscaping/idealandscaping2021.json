We've reduced water intrusion to the basement with gutter cleaning and by building up the soil against one wall. But heavy rain still streams along a paved walkway between the garage and the house, and water seeps into the basement.\n\nIn addition, the backyard is difficult to use because of the grade and because erosion has left only hard clay behind.\n\n**Goals**\n\nFrom highest priority down:\n\n1. No/minimal water intrusion into basement\n2. Hangout space that can accommodate about 10 people, including kids\n3. Area for a few young children to play, for us to throw out a couple blankets, and for a dog to pee &amp; poop\n4. Some vegetable/herb garden space (much of the yard is too heavily shaded for this)\n5. Qualification for local rainscaping grant program (worth a few thousand dollars)\n6. Maximal reuse of existing material (specifically concrete and soil)\n\n**Plan overview**\n\n1. Remove concrete walkway to garage and along garage to alley (mostly complete)\n2. Grade backyard to produce an upper section and lower section, both essentially flat\n3. Install retaining wall between upper and lower sections with steps or a ramp connecting them\n4. In lower section, install permeable surface patio\n5. In upper section:\n   1. Install a permeable surface path to the garage, and along garage to alley\n   2. One one side of path, create a shade-tolerant grass area for kids/dog\n   3. On other side of path, install a native garden, preferably including a dwarf tree at my wife's request\n6. Build a couple raised garden beds, and probably install a rain barrel to catch water from the flat roof of the house\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Currently getting bids for the remaining work\n* Open to doing some of the work myself, but availability is limited to vacation days and a couple hours here and there.\n* Utilities check complete, all clear. However:\n   * A buried electric line runs from the house to the garage (we know where to look for it)\n   * A possibly-working drain opening sits in the grass to the left of the old walkway (near the birdfeeder in the photo)\n* Concrete from current walkway is broken into 5-inch and finer chunks, would like to use these as the bottom layer of the patio bed and the area just behind the retaining wall to avoid sending it all to a landfill.\n* A 1-ton (28 inches wide) mini excavator should fit through the alley gate; a 33-inch model should fit if the gate and fence are removed.\n* For patio surface, have looked at [Romanstone Aqua-Bric Type 1](https://romanstone.com/products/concrete-pavers/century-series-pavers/aqua-bric-permeable-paver/) in terra cotta (brick red), but open to ideas\n* For the new path, could use the same patio material, stepping stones, whatever\n* For retaining wall, probably prefer an engineered block with a limestone-ish look\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Am I missing anything big?\n2. With only a little backhoe trenching experience, could I do the grading with a 1- or 2-day mini excavator rental?\n3. Any suggestions for materials?\n4.
