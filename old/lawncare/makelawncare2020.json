A list of specific questions is at the bottom.\n\n***\n\nI moved to the Pacific Northwest about 5 years ago, and purchased my first house here about 3 years ago. When my wife and I bought this house, the yard was decent. Not great, but not notably bad either. We've kept up on mowing, trimming, and watering the grass but haven't done much beyond that.\n\nEach year the yard looks a little bit worse. There's a little bit more moss and clover everywhere. Last year we tried spraying some killer around which sort of worked (the moss turned black at least), then tried raking it up and while a lot of moss came up, it seemed like we had barely made a dent. We've also had moles the past 2 years or so. The first year was real bad, but after much trial and error we managed to catch the bugger. The second year, now knowing how to deal with it, we jumped right on it and only had a couple hills crop up before we got him. Hopefully, that won't repeat this year, but we'll see.\n\nToday was the first real sunny day of 2020. I mowed the lawn today for the first time this year and am dismayed to see the moss has completely taken over the yard; orders of magnitude more moss than in previous years. (I've had the suspicion this was the case for a while, but as it has been rainy for the past 2 months or so there was a good amount of grass coming through the moss and the full scope of the infestation was not clear.)\n\nNeither I nor my wife have very much knowledge around proper lawn care, and what we have tried has been physically strenuous and shown minimal results. I suspect this is just us doing the wrong things and/or using the wrong tools, but on the occasions I've tried to get a better understanding of correct processes, I get marred down in conflicting advice and pictures of yards that look nothing like my own.\n\nI want to get to the point of maintaining the yard myself, but I feel like I'm so far behind the starting line both in knowledge and in the current state of my yard that I might need someone to come in and just get me to a decent starting place. Looking around at services though, I find I'm having a hard time finding one that I feel comfortable giving hundreds of dollars to with no guarantee they won't swindle me for a half-done job.\n\nAnd so I turn to this community for advice on how to proceed. Specifically my questions are:\n\n1. Is my yard recoverable, or do I need a professional to come in and fix or replace it? If the former, what should I do? If the latter, any recommendations for which services are trustworthy or what kinds of things I should look for or ask about to make that determination?\n2. The only lawn care equipment I own is a Craftman 40v electric push mower and the accompanying trimmer, a couple standard garden hoses and sprinklers, and a leaf rake. What else should I look into getting? I suspect a fertilizer spreader and/or an aerator, but even just mentioning those I'm outside my knowledgebase already (I know these are things that are useful, but not entirely sure how important they are or how to/how often to use them).\n3. Are there things I should be doing now, or do I need to wait until Spring officially starts next month?\n4. Assuming the yard is recoverable, how viable is it that I will have a healthy, thriving lawn this year? Or will I have to wait until next year to really see the benefits of this year's work?\n5. The one thing I repeatedly see called for before doing anything else is a soil test. Is the $12 kit at Lowe's sufficient for this? I keep hearing the recommendation to check my \"local cooperative extension\" that supposedly will help with this. As near as I can tell [this is mine](https://extension.wsu.edu/king/), but I don't see anything on that site relating to soil tests.\n\nThank you so much in advance for any help or guidance you can provide, as well as your patience with my ignorance/lack of experience. I'm usually pretty good at researching topics and being able to speak intelligently about them, but for some reason I've had a very difficult time getting a solid grasp on lawn care.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lawncare/comments/f1hvsq/lawn_care_newbie_getting_serious_about/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "lawncare", "result": true, "Selector": "we had barely made", "selectorShort": "make", "MarkedSent": "lawn care newbie, getting serious about maintenance but need guidance /!/ [album](https://imgur.com/a/eddlsdz) \\- zone 8b\n\napologies for the background context wall of text. a list of specific questions is at the bottom.\n\n***\n\ni moved to the pacific northwest about 5 years ago, and purchased my first house here about 3 years ago. when my wife and i bought this house, the yard was decent. not great, but not notably bad either. we've kept up on mowing, trimming, and watering the grass but haven't done much beyond that.\n\neach year the yard looks a little bit worse. there's a little bit more moss and clover everywhere. last year -----> we !!!  tried spraying some killer around which sort of worked (the moss turned black at least), then tried raking it up and while a lot of moss came up, it seemed like -----> we !!!  -----> had !!!  -----> barely !!!  -----> made !!!  a dent. we've also had moles the past 2 years or so. the first year was real bad, but after much trial and error we managed to catch the bugger. the second year, now knowing how to deal with it, we jumped right on it and only had a couple hills crop up before we got him. hopefully, that won't repeat this year, but we'll see.\n\ntoday was the first real sunny day of 2020. i mowed the lawn today for the first time this year and am dismayed to see the moss has completely taken over the yard; orders of magnitude more moss than in previous years.
