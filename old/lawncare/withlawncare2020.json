Help me answer my husband\u2019s questions. /!/ So since my husband and I moved into our home, our yard has been an issue. We live in a pricey area and it costs $200/month for a lawn service. I bought an inexpensive mower and mowed myself a few times and, when I got pregnant, my husband took over. He only mows every 2 weeks and isnt a fan. When I\u2019m not pregnant anymore I\u2019ll be able to help out, but a biweekly mowing is pretty much all we do. Then the weeds took over. By the end of fall, half our yard was destroyed. In this picture you can see that a hay-like weed completely ravaged half the yard. There are also drainage issues. (https://i.imgur.com/QmPUGKq.jpg) In the spring, I enlisted my husband\u2019s help and we managed to clear out a lot of the hay-like stuff, applied preemergent, and waited a couple weeks and seeded. This failed (because of the preemergent I\u2019m told), and weeds completely took over. The big issue is that there is nutsedge and it is spreading everywhere (https://i.imgur.com/y5Mnd6p.jpg). I bought sedge-hammer and my husband returned it because I\u2019m pregnant and he didn\u2019t want me applying it and also didn\u2019t want to apply it himself. Since then the nutsedge has flowered and is getting out of control. I want to solve these issues, but since I\u2019m pregnant and my husband doesn\u2019t have any time and doesn\u2019t like lawn work or know anything about it, I need to hire people to help. The issue is, I need to come up with a plan and as I do so, he questions everything I suggest. So, basically I need help addressing his questions so I can then hire a weed service, landscaper, or both. I boiled it down to two main issues.\n\n1. Do we just use a weed-control lawn service like lawn doctor, ignore drainage issues, and attempt to overseed to establish a lawn? My husband sees no issue with the drainage because it eventually drains by the next day. What are the issues with leaving it as is? Does this cause any further weed issues?\n\n2. If we do a weed control service, but then also hire a landscaper to till and reseed this fall, do they need to amend the soil with sand and grade it or is it okay to just grade it? I have two different opinions on this from landscapers. The old owner had a garden here and the soil is all black soil.\n\nAny help on those two questions would be an enormous help!

This year soil temps were at 52F as of March 1st in my area,  which is significantly warmer than normal according to the historical data\n* When soil temps are CONSISTENTLY around 52F - 53F apply the first half of pre-emergent. This assumes that you will be doing a split application, if you are not doing a split application then you can skip this step\n\n**April 2021:**\n\n* Continue to monitor soil temps, once they get around 70F and/or the forsythia starts to bloom apply second application of pre-emergent, if you are performing a split application\n   *  If you choose not to do a split application of pre-emergent (which is fine) apply pre-emergent when the forsythia blooms, this is usually in April sometime\n\n*NOTE:* It is important to consider the rates at which you are dropping pre-emergent if you are going to be planning a fall overseed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you have issues with fungus you can start your fungicide regimen towards the end of April, remember to rotate your fungicides!\n* If you have issues with grubs, you can start grub treatments / prevention at the beginning of April\n\n**May 2021:**\n\n* Apply 1.0 lb N / 1k sq. ft., you can do this in a split application or all at once\n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n*  If you notice that weeds are starting to develop, you can spot apply a post emergent herbicide. Once again be mindful of you application rates if you are planning an overseed\n\n**June 2021:**\n\n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* If the weather in your area is rainy, you can apply 0.5 lbs N / 1k sq. ft. ( Regardless of the weather I won't apply any N in June )\n\n**July 2021:**\n\n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* If the weather in your area is rainy, you can apply 0.5 lbs N / 1k sq. ft. ( Regardless of the weather I won't apply any N in July )\n\n**August 2021:**\n\n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* Overseed prep mid to end of august\n   * Scalp and bag\n   * Dethatch\n   * Aerate (if necessary)\n   *  Level\n* Depending on weather, overseed at end of august \n* IF NOT OVERSEEDING, early to middle of august you can apply another round pre-emergent. Once again check to see when soil temperatures start to cool down from the summer\n* IF NOT OVERSEEDING, start to drop nitrogen around mid august as well. The goal is to drop 1lb N / 1k sq. ft. per month.\\*\\*\n\n**September 2021:**\n\n*  If weather conditions were not favorable for overseeding at the end of august overseed at the start of September.\n   * First mow will be about 2 weeks after seeding\n   * After first mow apply 0.25 lbs of N / 1k sq. ft. each week for two weeks, then you can switch to 0.5 lbs of N / 1k sq. ft. every two weeks. \n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* IF NOT OVERSEEDING, Continue nitrogen application targeting 1lb N / 1k sq. ft. per month\n\n**October 2021:**\n\n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* Continue nitrogen application targeting 1lb of N / 1k sq. ft. per month\n\n**November 2021:**\n\n* Continue any grub or fungus treatments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said above, this is a rough guide of what my plans are.

( regardless of the weather i won't apply any n in june )\n\n**july 2021:**\n\n* continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* if the weather in your area is rainy, you can apply 0.5 lbs n / 1k sq. ft. ( regardless of the weather i won't apply any n in july )\n\n**august 2021:**\n\n* continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* overseed prep mid to end of august\n   * scalp and bag\n   * dethatch\n   * aerate (if necessary)\n   *  level\n* depending on weather, overseed at end of august \n* if not overseeding, early to middle of august you can apply another round pre-emergent. once again check to see when soil temperatures start to cool down from the summer\n* if not overseeding, start to drop nitrogen around mid august as well. the goal is to drop 1lb n / 1k sq. ft. per month.\\*\\*\n\n**september 2021:**\n\n*  if weather conditions were not favorable for overseeding at the end of august overseed at the start of september.\n   * first mow will be about 2 weeks after seeding\n   * after first mow apply 0.25 lbs of n / 1k sq. ft. each week for two weeks, then you can switch to 0.5 lbs of n / 1k sq. ft. every two weeks. \n* continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* if not overseeding, continue nitrogen application targeting 1lb n / 1k sq. ft. per month\n\n**october 2021:**\n\n* continue any grub or fungus treatments\n* continue nitrogen application targeting 1lb of n / 1k sq. ft. per month\n\n**november 2021:**\n\n* continue any grub or fungus treatments\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nas i said above, this is a rough guide of what my plans are. i will continue to update it as needed. once i have a little more time (hopefully tomorrow) i will lay out my specific product schedule as well.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n\\*soil tests can be performed at any time throughout the year but it is generally recommended to perform them in the spring sometime. i am planning on doing mine particularly early this year so that i can get a plan in place for any required soil remediation that may be required. the generalized advice is do one every year around the same time each year and soil remediation can be performed at any time.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n\\*\\*nitrogen can be dropped all at once or in split applications of 0.5 lbs n / 1k sq. ft. every two weeks. however you want to apply it, every 30 days you should be putting down a total of 1lb n / 1k sq. ft.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 1, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lawncare/comments/iutxo4/cool_season_yearly_plan_guide/", "identifyer": 230553, "year": "2020"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 234657, "autor": "jdono927", "date": 1590950318000, "content": "Government Class Survey /!/ Hello Lawn care enthusiasts!\n\nIn my government class, our final project is to come up with a public policy that addresses a local issue.\n\nFor my policy, I decided to cover the topic of noise coming from lawn care in the morning.
