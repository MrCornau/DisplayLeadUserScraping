Just wanted to share [the latest edition](https://thesequence.substack.com/p/-size-matters) of our free weekly digest. Please, see it below. The content of TheSequence is written by Jesus Rodriguez, one of the most-read contributors to KDNuggets and TDS. You can check his Medium [here](https://medium.com/@jrodthoughts). I'm a professional journalist with a passion for artificial intelligence. I think it's highly important to spread correct and practical information about ML and AI so I hope this promotion will not be too annoying. Your feedback is very appreciated, and please feel free to [sign up](https://thesequence.substack.com/) if you like it.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\u00a0Editorial\u00a0\n\nThe recent emergence of pre-trained language models and transformer architectures pushed the creation of larger and larger machine learning models. Google\u2019s BERT presented attention mechanism and transformer architecture possibilities as the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in ML, and the numbers seem surreal. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 set a record by processing 1.5 billion parameters, followed by Microsoft\u2019s Turing-NLG, which processed 17 billion parameters just to see the new GPT-3 processing an astonishing 175 billion parameters. To not feel complacent, just this week Microsoft announced a new release of its DeepSpeed framework (which powers Turing-NLG), which can train a model with **up to a trillion parameters**. That sounds insane but it really isn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat we are seeing is a consequence of several factors. First, computation power and parallelization techniques have evolved to a point where it is relatively easy to train machine learning models in large clusters of machines. Second and most importantly, in the current state of machine learning, larger models have regularly outperformed smaller and more specialized models. Knowledge reusability methods like transfer learning are still in very nascent stages. As a result, it\u2019s really hard to build small models that can operate in uncertain environments. Furthermore, as models like GPT-3 and Turing-NLG have shown, there is some unexplainable magic that happens after models go past a certain size.\n\nMany of the immediate machine learning problems might be solved by scaling the current generation of neural network architectures.
