Before/After Pics, Process, and Details with Budget ($4,500) Included. /!/ **TL;DR:** Originally, we were planning to do a small kitchen upgrade and just replace the ugly vinyl flooring and hallway carpet. Pretty quickly, we decided if we were going to do the work, we may as well do it all! It took about two months to complete and approximately $4,500 - cosmetic, no cabinets/plumbing/structural changes.\u00a0Upper Midwest.\n\n[You can find all the images here, including before/after and process.](https://imgur.com/a/28O6Bw2)\n\n**Some background:** Our house was built in 1927, but appears to have been flipped sometime in the early 2000s.... a DIY flip where they ran out of money in the middle, according to our neighbors. We have done a bunch of projects, but usually my dad helps out (he\u2019s a great woodworker and engineer). This was our first totally independent project, with some FaceTime support for questions and some borrowed tools. When we bought the house three years ago, we decided it\u2019s an 8ish year house, so all projects we do with that in mind.\n\nIt all started with a random Friday night when I asked my husband if he would help me rip up the carpet in the hallway....\n\nAfter ripping up the carpet, we had grand plans to sand/refinish the floors underneath. Luckily we had my dad come to lend us his sander and he told us the black mastic was probably full of asbestos (clearly someone had removed old tile in the 80s (?) then just laid carpet on top). We got some quotes for asbestos removal and refinishing and quickly decided it was not worth it and just put a new subfloor over the hallway. This also was a good choice because it made the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway all the same height. We assume they had done something similar in the kitchen, but decided to cover the tile/asbestos glue with subfloor instead of carpeting. It was our first time independently laying subfloor, and went surprisingly well - despite the stupid corners that we fixed before we put down flooring. We used a circular saw and a straightedge to cut, this was before we had a workbench so it kind of sucked. We lived with the subfloor only for a few months as we figured out what to do with the rest of the kitchen.\n\n**Cabinet decisions/process:** We actually like our cabinets size/orientation and were a big reason we bought the house. For a small kitchen, they really utilized the space well for storage while maximizing counter space. We went back and forth between whether to paint or not paint. Our dream kitchens all have beautiful wood cabinets. Our kitchen had wood cabinets that we saw at Menards while picking up quarter round. So, we decided to paint them. We researched paints and colors and eventually decided on a [Benjamin Moore](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/interior-exterior-paints-stains/how-to-advice/interiors/paint-kitchen-cabinets) paint. The bottoms are Tarrytown Green and the tops are Chantilly Lace. We considered blue, but then when we showed a sample my husband\u2019s family all said \u201cI thought you were choosing green.\u201d and we landed back on green. We regret all of our paint choices!! Not the colors, we love those, but the paint itself. It ran all over the place, randomly dripped, and was generally hard to work with. All the trim in our house is Sherwin Williams Emerald Enamel Trim Paint and now that we\u2019ve used something else, realize that paint is totally worth the absurd pricing. We only chose Benjamin Moore because we couldn\u2019t find a green we liked at Sherwin. The actual process was fine, the usual sand/prime/sand/paint/sand/paint/wait forever/install.\u00a0 We kept our hardware since we liked it, and installed soft close door hinges (never going back!)\n\n**Countertop decisions/process:** Originally, we wanted a butcher block. My husband bakes a lot of bread, and we decided that doing quartz would just generally be easier for flour cleanup. Our local friends had a good experience with IKEA, so we decided to do that. AND they were running a 15% off countertops so we could spring for the better looking ones. The whole process was super slick! You choose and purchase at IKEA, with a close estimate of the price. IKEA subcontracts to a local company who takes it from there. They were fast, communicative, did good measurements, fabricated in about two weeks, and installed in an hour, including the under mount sink. I\u2019ve heard some horror stories on the internet, so it\u2019s good if you\u2019re considering IKEA custom quartz countertops to get a local friend\u2019s experience. We disposed of our old countertops via a \u201cfree\u201d sign in our yard and a FB marketplace post. The person who picked them up said they use them for his Habitat for Humanity (ish, can\u2019t remember the company) homes in Guatemala.\n\n**Sink/faucet:** My husband loved spending forever looking at sinks and faucets. We don\u2019t have much space so choices were limited! We love a large, single sink. The touch less feature on the faucet sucked so we turned it off (less water pressure, slower). Next time we\u2019d get the cheap regular faucet, same style. We ended up getting the [Kraus Dual Mount Drop-In Sink](https://www.kraususa.com/kraus-kht411-25-25in-dual-mount-drop-in-stainless-steel-2-hole-single-bowl-kitchen-sink.html) and the [Kraus Bolden Touchless Sensor Faucet](https://www.kraususa.com/touchless-sensor-single-handle-18-inch-commercial-pull-down-kitchen-faucet-in-matte-black.html).\u00a0\n\n**Demo:** We were prepped with drywall to fix the backsplash drywall post demo. As we started, we quickly realized it was actually just peel and stick tile - who knew that existed?!? So that ended up being super easy and immediately made the space look better. The vinyl flooring went quickly once we started. The cat hated the residual glue on the floor and it was hilarious.\u00a0\n\n**Flooring decisions/process:** This was another go-back-and-forth decision, if you\u2019ve noticed the trend... We originally wanted Marmoleum. We installed sheet Marmoleum in our mudroom and it is our favorite floor. It was a pain to install though, so we had already decided we would hire out if we did Marmoleum. Since the rest of our house is blonde original hardwood, we didn\u2019t want something that would look too similar to the rest of the house since we knew it would be a lot of work to get a perfect match. We ruled out tile flooring since we already had a 3/8inch difference in flooring heights and weren\u2019t looking to have a tile hallway. We eventually landed on doing Cali Bamboo flooring, in [Aged Amber GeoWood](https://www.calibamboo.com/product-aged-amber-medium-brown-hardwood-floors-7204006501.html) since it claims to be easy to install and also waterproof. We laid the flooring ourselves using the Cali underlayment. It was a pain to cut since it was a limestone core, but eventually we got the hang of using a jigsaw for weird parts. We blew through a bunch of blades. We used a mitre for the straight cuts. We ended up flooring in the bathroom too, to get rid of the ugly vinyl. It looks good, but we wouldn\u2019t do it again. It\u2019s already coming apart in places despite our best efforts. It would have worked better with a rubber mallet and an s-bracket to tighten them up even more in the hallway. A floating floor is weird. We prefer hardwood, and if we were to do it again we would just get the hardwood we actually want. Even good looking engineered isn\u2019t the same as real wood. We still think we made the right choice for the space, function, and time in our lives.\u00a0\n\n**Backsplash decisions/process:** This one was easy. Dream handmade local tile is not for an 8-year house and subway tile is unbelievably cheap and easy to install for your first time. We used a tile cutter and an angle grinder to do the outlets, installed in a day. Used info from here to help out, as well as internet searching for the best way to lay tile backsplash. My husband also researched grout forever - we wanted a light grout but did not want all the work of light grout. We do not like the dark grout + subway. We ended up with [Platinum grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-115-Platinum-10-lb-Non-Sanded-Grout-PBG11510/202647231) and it was the right choice for us. Reaffirmed I hate all concrete work, grouting included. But it looks good! We cut out around our magnetic knife strip, which was a great idea because now knives aren\u2019t hanging on the wall by our back door.\u00a0\n\n**Thresholds:** My dad made us maple thresholds for Christmas, custom sized to our transitions. I stained and polyurethaned them. The staining was annoying because it was spotted all over the place (I didn\u2019t use a wood conditioner the first time). So, I had to re-sand all of them then wood condition and stain. A short project became a long annoying project... oh well!\u00a0\n\n**Undermount lighting:**\u00a0 My husband also was obsessed with undermount lighting, and researched a bunch before going with the [Philips LED strip](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-lightstrips), plugged in with our microwave.\n\n**Finishing:** We finished it all up with installing some quarter round, painting trim, and installing thresholds! And lots of caulking! And a new light fixture from [Olde Brick Lighting on Etsy](https://oldebricklighting.com)! The walls are all Alabaster by Sherwin Williams.\u00a0\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n\n1. Rip up carpet, lay subfloor in hallway\n2. Paint walls\n3. Paint cabinets/demo backsplash\u00a0\n4. Install countertops\n5. Lay flooring\n6. Do backsplash\n7. Finish/thresholds/trim\n\n**Budget-ish ($4500):**\n\n* Subfloor: $50\n* 2 gallons paint: $100\n* Soft close hinges: $200\n* Countertops + install: $2,400\n* Flooring: $700\n* Light fixture: $200 (or $400 if you count the first light we bought, installed, and hated)\n* Sink/Faucet: $500\n* Backsplash: $150\n* Other: $200\n* Thresholds: gift\n\n**If we were going to do it all again:**\n\n* (Opinion) Use real hardwood floors/never install laminate or engineered unless it\u2019s your basement\u00a0\n* Touchless sensor faucet isn\u2019t worth it\n* Use Sherwin Williams Emerald trim paint\n* Kitchens need light! We ordered a cool stained glass Tiffany light... looked great BUT gave off no light, even with 2X100W bulbs.\u00a0\n* Use an angle grinder the whole time for cutting tile. We used a jigsaw for a while and it sucked. Alternatively, ask your friend their opinion because turns out they had a wet saw you could have borrowed this whole time...\u00a0\n* Grouting is a two person job to clean/sponge if you're a first-timer. Make a plan before you start and both watch the same YouTube video! We did not and ended up yelling \u201cno not like that diagonal you\u2019re removing all the grout\u201d while making a mess.\n* Mitre corners when you are awake and fresh. The first time we tried doing quarter round we were too tired from laying flooring and just cut all these random pieces until we ran out of quarter round and nothing fit together anywhere. Then we stopped, ordered pizza, cleaned up and immediately fell asleep.\u00a0\n\n**Working with your partner on DIY:**\n\n* Doing your own research is good, but... make sure you come together and talk about it before you start. AKA watch the same YouTube videos or read some of the same articles. With so many different ways to do things, you can both be right but also be trying to use two different techniques.\u00a0\u00a0We may have done this and then finally figured it out by the end of the project.\n\nIf you made it to the end... congrats!

Not sure why. Posting with my other account, \n\nI've been searching this sub, YouTube vids etc., and I have a rough (very rough) idea of what I want to do with my detached garage. Would welcome your input, especially on my near term plans for water intrusion.\n\n**General info:** It's a detached brick garage (about 18x18) with a slate gabled roof. There's a single 15a electrical line. The floor is cement with no sealer or anything. There's an uninsulated garage door about 16 feet wide. The garage is considered a contributing structure in a historic neighborhood so I would need approval for certain types of exterior renovations. I'd also like to not permanently alter the structure. Built \\~1937-1941.\n\n**What I'd like to do:** I want to turn it into a shop space to do some light wood working and little electrical projects. I want to eventually have a 100a sub installed in the garage, have walls that I can hang stuff or install cabinets and shelves, I want climate control, and nice lighting. I also don't want to make any changes that would prevent a car from parking in it (we won't park a car in it, but if we sell I want it to be able to be used as an actual garage).\n\n**My rough plans:** I spoke to some general contractors and they were talking about $30-50k. That's not in the cards. I have more like $15k to spend. So I've been researching what pieces of this I could do myself and where I could act as my own GC and hire help for certain parts.\n\n***Near-term*** ***Structural fixes (water):***\n\nIssue: The roof leaks in a few spots.\n\nFix: I've had a roofer over and they are going to send me an estimate. This is a priority item and one that I will hire out. I've received a quote of $2800 to replace 25 slates, reseal hips, etc. I am waiting for two more quotes. Full replacement is nearly $16,000\n\nIssue: One of the corners at the base has water intrusion. When Ida clipped us, I had water leaking in.\n\nPartial Fix: A handyman looked at it and pointed out that my gutter dumped right at that corner, and that I should take a tube and reroute the water elsewhere. I've done that and saw no leaks when it poured for a day straight.\n\nIssue: There's efflorescence on some of the interior brick wall that sits below ground level.\n\nIssue: There's deteriorated/missing mortar in some spots on the exterior (including the corner where there was water intrusion) and in the interior.\n\nFix: I planned to dig up around the exterior to get to the foundation. I propose to remove and clean out deteriorated mortar with an angle grinder. I will likewise do this on the interior. I then planned to repoint using type N mortar. Once it cures, I was going to coat the exterior and interior with Foundation Armor (water based) using a garden sprayer.\n\nThat's my near-term plan (next month or two)--deal with the water intrusion. The rest of my plans are notional but I'd like your input if you have time.\n\n***Longer-term Plans***\n\n*Climate control/Interior Insulation:*\n\nI want to put in a mini-split--likely a Mitsubishi. I assume I'll hire this out though I see there are some DIY solutions. I suspect this will cost between $4000-$4500.\n\nFor insulation, I would put a moisture barrier on the Foundation Armor-treated brick walls, then stud framing. I don't have a lot of space between the wall and garage door tracks (6.5-7\" on each side). Not sure if I can use 2x3 instead of 2x4. I assume there's building codes on this. I would put down a seal under the floor plate (and use ground-contact treated wood for the bottom sil). I would insulate between the studs (not sure what yet), then a vapor barrier, then dry wall. I think I need a R20 or so in Baltimore, MD. I was thinking of doing the framing and insulation myself! I've read that its not terrible difficult, just labor intensive. I would likely hire someone to do the dry wall.\n\nFor the roof, I'm thinking about spray foam insultation and leaving it as is rather than creating a ceiling. I'd hire this out. I saw a thread re flammability. When I read threads here and elsewhere on ceilings, there is discussion on ventilation, soffits, etc. I don't understand the terminology so I'm struggling what to do here. \n\nI would look into an insulation kit for the garage door or possible replace the garage door. I'd have it installed I imagine.\n\n*Organization:*\n\nFor organization I was going to use slatwall on some of the walls. I'd do this. I have a bulldog hammer drill and some masonry bits. \n\n*Electrical:*\n\nI have three quotes to trench out to the garage. I've been quoted $3200-4000k for the trench, wiring, and subpanel. It's about a 60 foot run. I want to look into horizontal boring rather than trenching. (GF not keen on having the yard dug up.) Not sure when I should do the electrical--before or after the framing. I understand that wiring will need to be done before the drywall. I'd hire all of this out, though I can probably install the light ballasts and maybe the outlets.\n\n*Floor:*\n\nFor the floor, I was thinking of either leaving as is or doing the epoxy thing. It's fairly ugly right now. Not sure if I can do this myself. GF is paranoid about chemicals and won't want me doing anything that is seriously toxic. \n\n***Final thoughts:*** Not sure about the proper order of all these things--I assume water intrusion comes first. A handyman I use is also an architect and former woodworker.

So I was stumped for what to do to fix it, should I repaint or hire someone to re-tile? I ended up finding a blog about a fireplace makeover with Smart Tiles, which mentioned they are heat resistant. I decided to give it a try! It only needs to last a few years until I completely re-do the mantle &amp; surround, so I'm not too worried about its longevity. So far I haven't seen any issues due to the heat, the adhesive is VERY sticky and I don't see them coming off any time soon.

Materials were pricey- six pieces of Baltic Birch 3/4, 100 Krug jig screws and jig, 100 long kreg screws for stud work, and a few other odds and ends was around 500. \n\nCut it all. Screwed it together. Including lengthening the tops of the uprights about 7 inches to match the height of the other shelves (9\u2019). \n\nThen cut the middle shelves which are 12\u201d flush across the front to make the trims match. At this point it was starting to look like this wild ass plan of mine may actually work! Ha! \n\nThen cut the 25+ 10\u201d deep shelves for the rest of the job. I wised and when I bought the second several sheets of plywood had Lowe\u2019s precut these for me and it saved a huge hassle with the guide/skill saw. \n\nLaid them out, kreg jigged four holes in each (downward facing on the bottom and upward on the top so you can\u2019t see the holes standing or sitting near them. Bought 100 more 1.25 kreg screws! And a new torpedo level as my old one crapped out - 25 \n\nMy wife then helped me screw each shelf in level. \n\nStarted messing with general finishes gel stains to mix into the right color. Spent two weeks being a mad freaking scientist of find the perfect match of 3 parts GA cherry, 1 part brown mahogany, and 1 part Java gel stains. There are literally 20 pieces of scrap plywood and poplar trim in my garage right now all stained varying shades of a reddish dark brown...plus I probably looked like I was cooking meth or something in the garage with all the vials, cans, and plastic containers going. \n\nWent out for the facing trim. Poplar. Mostly 1x2 and 1x4 with a couple 1x6 for the footer and header. Ran the long ones through a borrowed table saw to get the thin slot in the front to match the other shelves. Nail gunned them up with a brad nailer (80 bucks from a prior project). I already have a compressor. \n\nStarted staining a first coat. Realized we hadn\u2019t cut the half moons at the top for the finish trim. Did that in a weekend by using a giant platter as a sabersaw template. This was slow and painstaking work but turned out good. Kreg screwed those into the back of the finished facing. Between the facing, each shelf being screwed together, and the boxes themselves screwed into the studs top and bottom, this thing is rock solid. \n\nTime to do a little electrical. The other shelves have a switched plug up top with LED up lights, 12\u2019 ceilings, 9\u2019 shelves. I started to pull the electrical apart and the breaker popped before I even got the cover fully off...uh oh. I was just going to run a second line into the switch and straight up the wall 6\u2019 or so to put a plug in. The previous owner did something dumb and the electrical in this box was baddddddd. Instead of a 5 dollar job from spare romex and electrical bits I mostly had, I called a pro. I don\u2019t mind working from electrical done right, but this wasn\u2019t. Cost me 200 bucks, but worth it as he squared it all away nicely. \n\nPlus around 40 for 2 18\u201d LED light bars. \n\nThat weekend I also bought/had milled the crown, it\u2019s a super close match to the  other crown on the existing. Only cost me around 50 dollars. Tacked that up. \n\nTacked on the poplar shoe molding. 5 dollars\n\nFinished the first coat staining. All in I\u2019ve spent around 100 dollars on stain, brushes, painting odds and ends, etc. I\u2019ll still need to spend at least another 50 for the clearcoat. \n\nI\u2019m still waiting on the last piece which had to be custom made, but it\u2019s a small 1.5x.75 shelf facing for the 10\u201d deep shelves. It\u2019ll match the other unit. Total cost of around 100 for 50\u2019. \n\nThen it\u2019ll be final coat of stain and clear. We\u2019re close and everyone has been amazed by how good it turned out. Myself included. So, when someone hands you an asinine quote for relatively straightforward work. Figure it out, do it yourself! It\u2019s been a great project. Best part is this is my zoom background (why I put some stuff up even without it being fully done), so my coworkers and clients are sometimes watching the progress day by day. It\u2019s been a couple months total. \n\nAll in I expect the project to come in under $2000 with the saw. If I didn\u2019t do electrical, didn\u2019t need to exactly match the other unit, and just painted it, I\u2019d say this could easily have been a $1-1.2k project. \n\nHappy to answer any questions or provide future guidance.

I had it inspected and tested for radon and such.   It had popcorn ceilings throughout and I was told they had a risk of asbestos.  Being inexperienced, I didn't know much about it except that it's terrible to breathe.   \n\nI opted for a DIY sample kit and scraped several spots in my basement.   My thinking is that the basement would be the best place to disturb potential asbestos if I needed to contain it.  I sent the sample in and it came back completely negative.   I rejoiced and began to work on the ceilings. \n\nMy brother in law has experience with this work so we bought some sprayers and scrapers and taped up the rooms to make cleanup easy.  We did not take much precautions since we had a negative test that made us confident we had nothing to worry about.  The ceilings came off pretty easy and we did the second floor and first floor in about a week. \n\nWe sanded,  mudded, textured and painted the ceilings and got rid of the waste.   Then I started on the basement.   I noticed these ceilings scraped funny and I got a weird feeling.   What if these were done later?  So I took it upon myself to collect residue from upstairs where we had previously scraped and got it tested.   \n\nTo my horror it came back positive as 8% Chrysotile asbestos.  We had started scraping a month ago by that time.   My house is surely contaminated.  Not only that, but my pregnant wife and 2 children have spent plenty of time with me doing work on the house.   \n\nI am distraught.  We were very close to our move in date and now we are dealing with this.   I've surely brought contaminated clothing into our apartment and done loads of laundry by now.   \n\nI have had several abatement companies inspect.  They advise to stop working until the house is clean which takes a while to get permitted.  Since there's nothing left to remove, it's really just the air and cleaning surfaces.  Oh ya and the ventilation since I had my heater running during cold days. \n\nWhat should I do?  Do I need to throw out my family's clothing?  Is a month of exposure with a major spill considered heavy?  Have I doomed my family to lung disease in 20 years?  The thing keeping me positive is the idea that even a month of exposure might still be relatively low risk.   My kids were often playing outside while we worked on our house.

I shut off water to the house, cleared all the old caulking around the wall flange, removed the mounting screws, then put a wrench on the bib to (hopefully) unscrew it from the pipe.  Initially the bib wouldn't move, and I figured the fitting was just sticky and I just needed to give it more torque.  So of course I did that, and suddenly the bib turned!  Success (or so I thought....).  Another turn and the bib seemed to release from the fitting (again...or so I thought).  I then was able to pull the bib out from the wall to find out that I did not release the bib from the fitting and instead had twisted the copper pipe behind it so much that it sheared itself right off.  At this point a state a dread washed over me and a realization came that I would need to call in a professional to remedy my error.\n\nThis being around 5:15pm on a Saturday, I didn't expect too many companies to answer the phone, but long story short I was able to find a plumbing company who could send someone out.  A bit later the actual guy coming to do the work called me to confirm he was on his way, and mentioned that there would be a 40% surcharge for the work due to it being an after-hours call.  Considering we couldn't turn the water back on to the house until we got this fixed, I told him sure, no problem, let's do it.\n\nSo, the guy and his helper came to our house, initially told me it would be ~$400 to open up the drywall inside my wall and check the line.  This gave me a moment of pause, but again, gotta get it done so sure go ahead.  He did say that amount would be applied towards the total bill, so we moved forward.  They got it opened up, did a quick survey and then called me back over and gave me the estimate, which was ***$1699***.  GAG.  In the moment though,  I was set on the mindset that we needed to get it done, so we told them to go ahead with it.  They got the work done in about an hour, everything looked good on my end, and we can finally turn our water back on - hurray!  We settled up with the guy and he and his helper went on his way.\n\nNow - it's about 5 hours later, and homeowner guilt is crushing over me.

(would definitely dread this has the slopes on our roof are extremely steep and we lack the knowledge and tools.)\n\ni called my insurance to inquire whether they would cover a replacement. they have told me to submit a claim as it won't hurt me to see what the adjuster determines. apparently if it's just old, no help. if there's storm damage, only help where the damage occurred. not looking hopeful on that front. to say this is a stress right now would be an understatement.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 16, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/qj454i/first_time_homeowner_have_lived_here_5_years_roof/", "identifyer": 154994, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 155272, "autor": "DaHomieBehemoth", "date": 1613444623000, "content": "Advice on tackling this project /!/ Hi r/HomeImprovement, i need advice on what the most efficient approach would be to complete removing paper on ceiling thats stuck with some adhesive.

I think there are many parts of this project that can be DIY, and other parts where I may need to hire a professional. I am not opposed to doing this, but also don't want to make the project more complicated than it needs to be. \n\nBig picture, I want to convert the garage into a CrossFit gym. \\~Half the space will be the gym, the other half will be storage for lawn equipment, tools, etc. \n\n# Summary: \n\nBought a new house (located in the Midwest) in July 2020 that has a detached, 24' x 24', 2-door garage. \n\n* 8 ft. sidewalls, 4/12 pitched roof.\n* 2x4 wood trusses, spaced every 24\"\n* No sheathing (siding nailed directly to the exterior of the studs).\n* No house wrap.\n* No insulation.\n* No drywall (or other interior wall covering).\n* Electrical already installed.\n* No plumbing (not needed).\n* No HVAC (not needed).\n\n#  Ceiling Height\n\n [https://imgur.com/vSfKNtO](https://imgur.com/vSfKNtO)\n\n [https://imgur.com/iFAmjh1](https://imgur.com/iFAmjh1)\n\n [https://imgur.com/AgYsEig](https://imgur.com/AgYsEig)\n\n A major controlling factor of this project is the finished ceiling height. Right now, with the trusses that run across the width of the garage the height to the bottom of the rafters is 8'-3\". The bare minimum I need is 9 Ft., but Ideally I would like to open things up so that I have around 11 Ft.\n\nFrom the research that I've done, it seems I will need to hire a structural engineer to evaluate the project and provide engineering for modifying the trusses (i.e., what can be removed, and what needs to be installed in its place to re-establish structural support). The idea that I have seen implemented on similar projects is a cathedral type ceiling as follows: The bottom rafter part of the truss is removed, the vertical ties are removed, and \\~2x8s (size TBD) are installed from the top of the wall-plate up to the peak of the roof and back down the other side. This is then bolted to the part of the original truss that is left in place along the roof line. It seems that it IS possible to do this, so long as it is done correctly. I am currently estimating that at the very least, I need to \"modify\" 1 truss to give me the overhead room that I want. Perhaps I will convince myself this is the best way to go, in order to prevent a massive headache. If it is an easy enough process to do this, somewhere in the ballpark of 2 - 4 trusses would be ideal.\n\nI am assuming this process would require an inspection after the work is done.\n\n# Insulation/Walls\n\nIt is 1 degree (F) outside as I write this. I would like this space to be insulated well enough so that I can at least take the bite off the chill during the winter. In the summer it does get quite hot but I plan to open all the doors/windows and run some fans just to get the air moving. My concern is that right now I ONLY have siding to protect the space from weather. \n\nIs this a common practice for detached garages? Could it be a special type of siding? \n\nBasically, I am wondering if it would be okay to leave it in place and go ahead and insulate and finish the interior. Or, If I need to remove all of the siding, install plywood sheathing/house wrap, and then install new siding.\n\nI don't plan to modify the framing whatsoever, so I am assuming that adding/removing wall materials, insulation, etc. will not require an inspection.\n\n# Electrical\n\nAs I have stated in the summary, the electrical is already in place. The garage has its own breaker box that is being fed from the house. Not much work to do here other than possibly re-routing some wires around during the project.

This was my first time attempting a fire pit and it turned out nicely.

All said and done, materials ended up costing around $600 spent mostly at Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s. I had to buy a few tools but made the money back on those by selling them afterwards: tiller, wheelbarrow, tamper.\n\nI [started](https://i.imgur.com/sar7e6G.jpg)by digging out about 2\u201d deep in a large circle big enough to accommodate the pit plus room for seating.

Using the other end of the string, I spray painted the circle on the dirt for reference. The tamper helped to get the dirt even after all the digging.\n\nI then dug a deeper (about 12\u201d deep) small hole in the center to later fill with rocks and act as a drain for the pit during rain.

I placed the stones in 3 levels on top of the sand and secured the stones with construction adhesive.

Completely DIY, custom, and cost efficient /!/ I bought an old shotgun house about 2.5 years ago and just finished the rebuild. All work is my own outside of the roof and HVAC. I thought I'd share my finished kitchen. Keeping with my desire to do as much custom work as I could, and keep costs down, I used Ikea cabinets and made custom fronts and paneling. I also made precast concrete countertops, and open shelving from solid maple. It was a complete gut and redesign, as with the rest of the house. \n\nThe floors are solid hickory throughout the house, and I stuck with that in the kitchen, because it's open to the living space. It was 4.79 per sq ft.or about $1000 for the area the kitchen inhabits.\n\nAll cabinets were purchased from Ikea without doors. I then made doors from maple plywood and edge-banding for a clean, contemporary look. I painted them with an airless sprayer using Benjamin Moore Advance. The door handles are Amazon Basics brand. The total cost of the cabinets was roughly $3500 all in. \n\nThe countertops are made with Quickrete countertop mix. I've made my own mix before, and this stuff is perfect as it is. I made templates with 4\" strips of PVC and a glue gun.I used white melamine particle board sheets to build the forms. After about 3 days, I broke the forms off and polished the tops with diamond grit pads and a handheld concrete polisher. The total cost was less than $300 for about 55 sq ft of countertop including the waterfall end piece on the island.\n\nThe maple shelving is made with solid maple 1x material and polycrylic coating.

I've done many DIY projects but this was my first retaining wall. /!/ We bought our house in Nov of last year and while there's a ton we love about it there's also been a lot of work whipping it back in to shape. One of the projects we had completed right away was removing several dead trees that threatened the house. One tree was a giant oak that was probably an awesome tree while alive but unfortunately ivy had been allowed to grow all the way to the top and it was completely choked out and dead as a door nail. This tree sat no more than 4-5 ft in front of the house so taking it down was a no brainer. If this would've fell it would've taken out about 1/2 of our house. Trying to find the silver lining we decided where the tree sat would be a great place for a patio. While removing the tree the heavy equipment was the breaking point for an old retaining wall that was barely still standing. After they were done with removing the tree the wall had just completely failed and I knew to do the patio the first step would be putting in a new retaining wall. \n\nI wanted a block that was a little ragged and imperfect. I didn't want the wall to look too new as I'm trying to maintain the character of our 1934 home. I also needed the block to be gray since that was the color of all the other stone work around the property. I found a block that fit the bill at Menards. It's a block by Crestiline ( I think) and the color was \"quarry gray\". Menards is currently running their 11% rebate plus I'm getting 5%cash back at home improvement stores with my Chase card this quarter so now was the perfect time to do this project. \n\nI didn't really have a budget for this project but after it was all said and done I ended up having about $1200 in the project. You could definitely do it for cheaper though. I paid $360 for my delivery of 21 tons of #4 stone. I didn't need but maybe a ton for my backfill but I needed to touch up some sections of my driveway so I just went ahead and got a full load with the plan of using the leftover for my driveway. Also I bought some tools that I didn't really need like a 6ft level. I have two 4ft levels already but I had been looking for an excuse to buy a 6 footer and this was my chance. Realistically if you were on a tight budget you could do this same wall for around $700 if you already had all the tools you need. \n\nSpeaking of tools, the tools I used were:\n\n\\-Spade shovel and flat shovel\n\n\\-hard rake\n\n\\-4lb mini sledge and 4\" chisel\n\n\\-rubber mallet (this gets used ALOT...get a good one)\n\n\\-garden hoe\n\n\\-2025r tractor with and a few different implements (obviously not at all needed but very helpful when working alone)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said this was my first retaining wall and it was going to have to be a \"stepped wall\" so that complicated it a bit. I didn't know how to measure where my steps would be so I just had to run my first row level until I came to a point where the majority of the next block to be laid was going to be buried. When I hit that point I would go a head and lay the next block almost fully buried then step up to continue on. It worked out but it was definitely not the most efficient way to do it as I kept having to dig throughout the project. I would've much preferred to do all the digging at once. I ended up having 2 \"step ups\" for my 40 ft wall. Another issue I ran into was I built up my drainage pipe to quickly on the first part of the wall so by the time I got to the end the drainage pipe was about 3 rows up. I think it'll be fine due to the extra wide trench I made for all the drainage stone and because the block is so imperfect there are plenty of gaps for water to weep through the face. Only time will tell on that though.

 projects but this was my first retaining wall. /!/ we bought our house in nov of last year and while there's a ton we love about it there's also been a lot of work whipping it back in to shape. one of the projects we had completed right away was removing several dead trees that threatened the house. one tree was a giant oak that was probably an awesome tree while alive but unfortunately ivy had been allowed to grow all the way to the top and it was completely choked out and dead as a door nail. this tree sat no more than 4-5 ft in front of the house so taking it down was a no brainer. if this would've fell it would've taken out about 1/2 of our house. trying to find the silver lining we decided where the tree sat would be a great place for a patio. while removing the tree the heavy equipment was the breaking point for an old retaining wall that was barely still standing. after they were done with removing the tree the wall had just completely failed and i knew to do the patio the first step would be putting in a new retaining wall. \n\ni wanted a block that was a little ragged and imperfect. i didn't want the wall to look too new as i'm trying to maintain the character of our 1934 home. i also needed the block to be gray since that was the color of all the other stone work around the property. i found a block that fit the bill at menards. it's a block by crestiline ( i think) and the color was \"quarry gray\". menards is currently running their 11% rebate plus i'm getting 5%cash back at home improvement stores with my chase card this quarter so now was the perfect time to do this project. \n\ni didn't really have a budget for this project but after it was all said and done i ended up having about $1200 in the project. you could definitely do it for cheaper though. i paid $360 for my delivery of 21 tons of #4 stone. i didn't need but maybe a ton for my backfill but i needed to touch up some sections of my driveway so i just went ahead and got a full load with the plan of using the leftover for my driveway. also i bought some tools that i didn't really need like a 6ft level. i have two 4ft levels already but i had been looking for an excuse to buy a 6 footer and this was my chance. realistically if you were on a tight budget you could do this same wall for around $700 if you already had all the tools you need. \n\nspeaking of tools, the tools i used were:\n\n\\-spade shovel and flat shovel\n\n\\-hard rake\n\n\\-4lb mini sledge and 4\" chisel\n\n\\-rubber mallet (this gets used alot...get a good one)\n\n\\-garden hoe\n\n\\-2025r tractor with and a few different implements (obviously not at all needed but very helpful when working alone)\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nas i said this was my first retaining wall and it was going to have to be a \"stepped wall\" so that complicated it a bit. i didn't know how to measure where my steps would be so i just had to run my first row level until i came to a point where the majority of the next block to be laid was going to be buried. when i hit that point i would go a head and lay the next block almost fully buried then step up to continue on. it worked out but it was definitely not the most efficient way to do it as i kept having to dig throughout the project. i would've much preferred to do all the digging at once. i ended up having 2 \"step ups\" for my 40 ft wall. another issue i ran into was i built up my drainage pipe to quickly on the first part of the wall so by the time i got to the end the drainage pipe was about 3 rows up. i think it'll be fine due to the extra wide trench i made for all the drainage stone and because the block is so imperfect there are plenty of gaps for water to weep through the face. only time will tell on that though. i'll need to go through a couple winters to see how it's really holding up. \n\ni had all my materials staged and ready to go around noon this past thursday and i finished the wall yesterday evening around 6pm but that was after only working on it for a few hrs. the majority of work was done fri and sat so this wall basically took me about 3 days to build by myself. \n\nalbum here: [https://imgur.com/a/bpbvva2](https://imgur.com/a/bpbvva2)", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 145, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/myb5cr/built_a_retaining_wall_over_the_weekend_ive_done/", "identifyer": 160407, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 161110, "autor": "Chrisayy25", "date": 1624305074000, "content": "DIY Landscape Lights /!/ Hi, I am thinking of installing landscape lighting.

Thus began our bathroom makeover saga. (Imgur link and cost breakdowns at the bottom of this post).\n\nOriginally I didn't plan to do a full room facelift, but once the vanity was here it felt like there was no reason to put off things like updating the paint and fixtures. Easy peasy, right? WELL...\n\n**The biggest lesson I learned during this project was to never assume the previous owners of our home did** ***anything*** **correctly.** Why do a good job when a half-assed hackjob will suffice? Every step of the way I seemed to run into some horror they'd left behind, such as:\n\n* **Cabinets attached to the wall with light duty drywall anchors**. Yep I almost died at the beginning of this project, and I wasn't even in the bathroom! I was getting batteries for the flashlight so I could find our main water shut off in the crawlspace, when the utility room cabinet suddenly lurched forward from the wall. It turned out it had been attached to exactly ONE stud running down the exact center of the cabinet, and every other screw (at the corners, etc) was anchored with tiny red drywall anchors. Lucky for me, the particle boards holding the whole thing to the stud didn't snap completely in half, and the paint cans on top of it didn't fall on me, so I didn't end up in the hospital.\n* **Non-standard supply valves with flimsy plastic handles for the sink.** The handles broke immediately when I went to turn the water off at the sink to remove the pedestal. No biggie--I just took the handles off and used pliers to turn them off. The hot water was leaky in the off position, though, so I put a bucket under it while I got the new vanity in, but then the connections on the hoses were way too small. I had a hell of a time going back and forth to the hardware store trying to find and adapter that would work, but in the end I had to call a plumber even after I found one, because the hot water valve sprung another leak when I opened it up again. Plumber ended up replacing both valves because they were nonstandard anyway. Now they're the correct size and have metal handles that won't break.\n* **Hacked together drain system.** The plumber also had to redo everything from the P-trap to the wall to make it right. I was glad we'd had to call him in, because he saved me a lot more DIY headaches on this front.\n* **Outlet vaguely attached to back of medicine cabinet (and** ***nothing*** **else).** I wanted to replace our medicine cabinet with a large mirror, but it has an electrical outlet in the back that we'd like moved, so we need to have an electrician out first. I thought I could at least paint under where the cabinet hangs now, just to save time later. But when I removed the plate from the outlet and unscrewed the cabinet from the wall, I found that there's actually a giant rectangular hole in the drywall behind it (there was likely an old recessed cabinet there at some point) and the outlet box wasn't attached to *anything* except the back of the medicine cabinet (which explains why it's always felt a bit loose in there). I have a call in to my usual electrician about it, because I'm pretty sure it's not up to code and needs to be fixed. I don't know when they'll be able to get to it though...\n\n**After dealing with all that mess, I ran into a few other issues** that weren't the previous owner's fault (not directly anyway!). First I discovered peeling paint on the window trim that I needed to take care of, and when I put my first coat of paint on the walls, the (old) ceiling paint started peeling off with my painter's tape too! So I ended up having to sand, prime and paint the ceiling as well, even though it wasn't in my original plan. I used a \"peel stop\" primer on both the window trim and the ceiling after *very* carefully removing as much peeling paint as possible (especially on the window trim since lead paint is more likely there), then painted over with at least two coats. I did NOT sand the window trim.\n\n**Probably the biggest thing I learned from this project (besides never trust previous homeowners) was that taping off edges for each coat of paint is a huge waste of time.** I got much nicer edges when I just cut in with a brush (I got [one of these](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Wooster-2-in-Shortcut-Polyester-Angle-Sash-Brush-0Q32110020/100357411) for that), and I could have shaved at least a day off the project by not waiting for coats to be dry enough to tape again. Also, even though the Valspar cans say you only need one coat, it took two in order to get nice even color on all the walls.\n\nIn the end, even though we ran into all these issues and I made a few mistakes, I'm still very happy with how the project turned out. It's really amazing what a new coat of paint and some updated fixtures will do for a little bathroom. \n\n**If we hadn't had to call the plumber, this whole project as pictured would have run us just over $500**, which isn't too bad I think.

i was getting batteries for the flashlight so i could find our main water shut off in the crawlspace, when the utility room cabinet suddenly lurched forward from the wall. it turned out it had been attached to exactly one stud running down the exact center of the cabinet, and every other screw (at the corners, etc) was anchored with tiny red drywall anchors. lucky for me, the particle boards holding the whole thing to the stud didn't snap completely in half, and the paint cans on top of it didn't fall on me, so i didn't end up in the hospital.\n* **non-standard supply valves with flimsy plastic handles for the sink.** the handles broke immediately when i went to turn the water off at the sink to remove the pedestal. no biggie--i just took the handles off and used pliers to turn them off. the hot water was leaky in the off position, though, so i put a bucket under it while i got the new vanity in, but then the connections on the hoses were way too small. i had a hell of a time going back and forth to the hardware store trying to find and adapter that would work, but in the end i had to call a plumber even after i found one, because the hot water valve sprung another leak when i opened it up again. plumber ended up replacing both valves because they were nonstandard anyway. now they're the correct size and have metal handles that won't break.\n* **hacked together drain system.** the plumber also had to redo everything from the p-trap to the wall to make it right. i was glad we'd had to call him in, because he saved me a lot more -----> diy !!!  headaches on this front.\n* **outlet vaguely attached to back of medicine cabinet (and** ***nothing*** **else).** i wanted to replace our medicine cabinet with a large mirror, but it has an electrical outlet in the back that we'd like moved, so we need to have an electrician out first. i thought i could at least paint under where the cabinet hangs now, just to save time later. but when i removed the plate from the outlet and unscrewed the cabinet from the wall, i found that there's actually a giant rectangular hole in the drywall behind it (there was likely an old recessed cabinet there at some point) and the outlet box wasn't attached to *anything* except the back of the medicine cabinet (which explains why it's always felt a bit loose in there). i have a call in to my usual electrician about it, because i'm pretty sure it's not up to code and needs to be fixed. i don't know when they'll be able to get to it though...\n\n**after dealing with all that mess, i ran into a few other issues** that weren't the previous owner's fault (not directly anyway!). first i discovered peeling paint on the window trim that i needed to take care of, and when i put my first coat of paint on the walls, the (old) ceiling paint started peeling off with my painter's tape too! so i ended up having to sand, prime and paint the ceiling as well, even though it wasn't in my original plan. i used a \"peel stop\" primer on both the window trim and the ceiling after *very* carefully removing as much peeling paint as possible (especially on the window trim since lead paint is more likely there), then painted over with at least two coats. i did not sand the window trim.\n\n**probably the biggest thing i learned from this project (besides never trust previous homeowners) was that taping off edges for each coat of paint is a huge waste of time.** i got much nicer edges when i just cut in with a brush (i got [one of these](https://www.homedepot.com/p/wooster-2-in-shortcut-polyester-angle-sash-brush-0q32110020/100357411) for that), and i could have shaved at least a day off the project by not waiting for coats to be dry enough to tape again. also, even though the valspar cans say you only need one coat, it took two in order to get nice even color on all the walls.\n\nin the end, even though we ran into all these issues and i made a few mistakes, i'm still very happy with how the project turned out. it's really amazing what a new coat of paint and some updated fixtures will do for a little bathroom. \n\n**if we hadn't had to call the plumber, this whole project as pictured would have run us just over $500**, which isn't too bad i think. with the plumber, it came out to \\~$940.\n\n[imgur link with before and after photos](https://imgur.com/xcc6hjd) as well as a couple more documenting our previous owners' negligence.\n\n**full cost breakdown/parts list:**  \n[\"arvesen\" vanity/sink combo](https://www.homedepot.com/p/home-decorators-collection-arvesen-18-in-w-x-12-in-d-vanity-in-tobacco-with-ceramic-vanity-top-in-white-with-white-sink-arvesen-18t/304942911) from home depot: $230   \nmoen \"iso\" [towel bar](https://www.lowes.com/pd/moen-iso-chrome-single-towel-bar-common-18-in-actual-20-44-in/1001857514) and [ring](https://www.lowes.com/pd/moen-iso-towel-ring-in-chrome/1002750604) purchased from lowes: $58  \n[new led light fixture](https://www.homedepot.com/p/commercial-electric-13-in-color-selectable-led-flush-mount-with-night-light-feature-optional-white-and-oil-rubbed-bronze-trim-rings-56584112/313979562) (not pictured) purchased from home depot: $50  \nzinsser \"peel stop\" triple thick primer (for the window trim and ceiling): $44   \nvalspar signature latex paint in \"rising star\" (very light purple), \"purple royalty\" (accent wall) and \"ultra white\" (ceiling) (lowes): $74  \nkrylon gloss colormaxx white enamel (window and other trim topcoat), lowes: $10  \npainting tools (brushes, drop cloths, etc): $37  \nplumber: $435\n\ntotal without plumber: $503  \ntotal with plumber: $938", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 69, "media": null, "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/of5o6w/the_many_sins_of_our_previous_homeowners_bathroom/", "identifyer": 162918, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 163360, "autor": "BujuB777", "date": 1626222030000, "content": "Stump grinding - DIY? /!/ I have a large yard and the previous owners took down about 8 trees, leaving the stumps behind.

I knew going into the purchase that I would want to renovate damn near everything. I decided to start with the flooring in two of the three bedrooms since I know for sure I absolutely do not want the carpet that came with them (it's nasty -- stinks, crusty in spots, and just doesn't look good).\n\nI know that once I start moving stuff into these bedrooms it will become more difficult to achieve the necessary motivational activation energy to get started. Because of this I have already begun demolition by tearing up the carpet, padding, and carpet tack strips.\n\n# problem 1: vinyl tiling and mastic, likely containing asbestos\n\nOne thing I should note at the outset here -- I did uncover 9x9 vinyl tiles and because pulling up the carpet tack strips damaged the tile (they were nailed through the vinyl tile to the concrete) I decided to proceed with removing the tile entirely.\n\nNow this is the first problem I need to solve -- my parents visited and my stepdad mentioned that these tiles likely have asbestos (hi asbestos bot, thanks for your helpful advice!). At this point I stopped work and immediately did a good amount of internet searching for advice. The first thing I did with the information I gathered was:\n\n* bought large plastic sheets to mostly wall off these bedrooms from the rest of the house (not hermetically sealed)\n* bought a shop vac with a HEPA filter\n* bought a simple floor HEPA filter that claims to detect and report the amount of 2.5 and 10 PM that passes through it\n* bought one of those lawncare water/chemical pumps sprayers so i could wet the concrete and tile to reduce dust\n* bought several of those fancy disposable hazmat suits with the booties and hoodie to wear while working\n* bought heavy duty disposable latex gloves\n* bought heavy duty woven contractor waste disposal bags to contain the tiles (which have sharp edges)\n* bought 3 mil contractor waste disposal bags to put the woven bags in\n* have ordered 6 mil contractor wast disposal bags that have asbestos labels on them\n\nIn addition to this, prior to these purchases I already had and was wearing safety glasses and a Moldex respirator with dual P100 filters (and have ordered several more pairs of replacement filters) while working just out of common sense.\n\n**I know this is not at the standards of a professional asbestos testing and abatement, but after internet searching and reading up on available literature I am working at a comfortable personal risk level. I will be dropping off several samples of various materials from throughout my house at a testing facility soon to get a better idea of exactly what kind of asbestos i am dealing with and where else I might expect to deal with it later in my series of renovation projects. I appreciate in advance any further advice (short of \"you shouldn't be doing this, you should pay an asbestos contractor\" -- i have read the horror stories have a sufficient understanding of the risks and again am comfortable with my level of risk) anyone might have regarding PPE and risk mitigation!**\n\nSo the actual problem here that I need to solve is that under the tiles I have carefully pulled up there is black mastic which likely also contains asbestos. My current plan is to seal this with a product I have found called \"Perfect Primer\" and encapsulate it with a product from the same company called \"Perfect Membrane\" before putting down a layer of self-leveling concrete. **I would be super grateful if anyone who has had experience with this approach could let me know what their experience was like since the only reviews I can find for the product are on the company's website**.\n\n# problem 2: large cracks in concrete\n\nThe oldest carpet tack strips mentioned above were nailed in with absurdly long concrete nails (2-3 inches). The edges of the floor along the exterior walls of the house have very large cracks. My current assumption is that it was the long concrete nails that created these cracks. Pulling up the carpet tack strips and their nails pulled up a lot of loose material resulting in what to me are alarmingly large cracks (see photos below). The problem here is how to deal with these cracks. Should I just patch them with whatever patching compound I come across before applying the Perfect Primer and (eventually) laying down the flooring?\n\n**bedroom 1**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rxyiQYs](https://imgur.com/a/rxyiQYs)\n\n**bedroom 2**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/L2LP4ss](https://imgur.com/a/L2LP4ss)\n\n# my (rough) plan\n\nOkay that was a length preamble but here is my rough plan for how to proceed with these two bedrooms. I will be including steps that are already done because they are also planned for the third bedroom that also has nasty carpet but which I am sleeping in currently.\n\nThe three bedrooms add up to roughly 360 sq ft together. When ordering materials I will account for about 20% wasteage since there will definitely be a learning curve involved.\n\n**Phase 1: Demolition, Disposal, Testing, &amp; Encapsulation**\n\nNote: for all steps below assume I am taking care to wet everything down, wear PPE, use HEPA vacuum and HEPA air filter, properly bag tiles for disposal as described above.\n\n* Remove carpet and pad, bag for disposal through city solid waste collection.\n* Remove carpet tack strips with prybar and hammer, bag for collection and disposal by certified asbestos experts (since they were nailed through vinyl tiles that likely contain asbestos).\n* Remove trim to get better access to cracks when patching them. The trim looks awful anyway.\n* Carefully pry up vinyl tiles (they come up very easily with my pry bar), bag for collection and disposal by certified asbestos experts.\n* Patch the large concrete cracks using some kind of compound designed for that purpose *(open to suggestions for materials and process here)*\n* Use [Perfect Primer](https://perfectprimer.com/product/perfect-primer-retail/) \\+ Perfect Membrane to seal/encapsulate the asbestos assumed to be in the black mastic.\n\nIn addition to the above, I will also look for opportunities to seal air gaps I can see between the sill plates and the concrete.\n\n**Phase 2: New flooring**\n\nMy end goal for this flooring is either hardwood or high quality engineered hardwood. My main priority is not aesthetics nor cost reduction, but durability, maintainability, and (long term) resale value. Aesthetics and cost reduction will be considered after these criteria are satisfied. So I think high quality engineered hardwood is what I will go with. Because of this I believe I will need a vapor barrier between the flooring and the concrete (I suspect the Perfect Membrane may address this need -- anyone out there familiar with it?).\n\nAnyway, my plan gets a bit fuzzier here. For example, I'm not sure if I should add insulation between the concrete and the flooring. I live in central New Mexico, so the coldest colds aren't that bad and are moderated considerably by daytime temperatures. As mentioned above, based on what I've read so far I believe it will be important to have a vapor barrier over the concrete but probably not as important as in a humid climate and again I'm not sure if I need anything in addition to the Perfect Membrane.\n\nI do like the idea of insulation under the floor. Is there such thing as dual purpose insulation + vapor barrier I could use here?\n\nThe next part I'm a little fuzzy on is which of these parts I should glue down and which should be \"floating\". I suspect the insullation/water barrier should be glued and the flooring could either be glued to that or snapped in the floating approach where there is one column of tiles glued down and the rest are snapped onto that.\n\nSo the rough outline should look something like this:\n\n* Use self-leveling concrete over the perfect membrane. *(open to suggestions for materials and process here)*\n* Fill in any air gaps found along the sills through the bottom gap under the drywall, presumably using some kind of caulking substance made for this purpose. *(open to suggestions for materials and process here)*\n* Put down a vapor barrier and subfloor insulation. *(open to suggestions for materials and process here)*\n* Put down engineered hardwood flooring. *(open to suggestions for materials and process here)*\n* Finish flooring with a glossy coat. *(open to suggestions for materials and process here)* \n* Install new trim.\n\n**Phase 3: refinish walls**\n\nThis part of the plan is really rough and may happen entirely after flooring is complete. The only reason I mention it is that I am considering stripping paint from the walls and it seems to me like it may be a good idea to do this before trim is installed. At this point I have written so much that I imagine no one will get this far, but if someone does who likes to give advice I am all ears.\n\nI do plan to test the drywall for asbestos and the paint for lead before doing any serious work on the walls. Same goes for the ceiling.\n\nIf you do get this far, thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any advice you might be able to offer!", "link":

Both my fianc\u00e9 and I are DIY newbies, but we had the experience of my Dad, a great handyman, to carry us through it. We began this project on 11/1/20 and finished up on 1/6/21 doing all work ourselves. My fianc\u00e9 and I are both nurses, so our schedules make it easier to devote full days to projects. \n\n**Project process and details:** \n\nWe bought the house knowing that there was a pretty significant leak that ran down the pipes all the way to the basement, and originally thought it was due to the toilet flange leaking or the sink bowl being cracked. \n\nOnce we gutted the room, we found the sink drain was sloped where the water would have to run uphill, so we took out more drywall to look at it. We found that when the house settled, the sink drain that went through the joists in this bathroom was partially snapped off of the main plumbing stack. What a nightmare. No wonder the previous owners stopped using this bathroom. \n\nGood news was we found the source before finishing the bathroom. We also discovered that the book shelf in the family room below it is to cover up water damage. So we did a lot of plumbing and basically recreated the entire plumbing stack. We installed the bath, and had to plumb the tub section of drain pipes twice because we messed it up.\n\nThen we got to replacing the exhaust fan and venting it to the outside (of course the old one was venting into the attic).  Drilling a hole through our wood siding was a nightmare, we burned through 3 batteries trying to do it. We installed a humidity sensing fan switch because we have certain members of the household that \"forget\" to turn the fan on when showering (I now love this feature).  I ended up knocking down the texture on the ceiling, sanding and re-stippling it. The damage from removing the old fan was so great that trying to texture over it would have made it apparent that there was a hole patched. At the same time we put in a bunch of screws attaching the drywall back to the ceiling joists. The ceiling was visibly sinking in; I think the only thing holding it up was the previous fan. \n\nAt that time, we also ran new electrical wire to the upstairs outlet, which will serve the master bath and hallway bath receptacles. The circuit servicing this bathroom is fairly large and we had an issue where running a work light in one of the bedrooms and turning on the shopvac tripped the breaker.\n\nAfter that we turned to drywalling the entire wall we ripped out, cement boarding the shower and creating the shower niche.\n\nNext was fixing the rotted subfloor and adding another layer to bring it to the level of the rest of the house. The house has two layers of subfloor all through it, they put down 1/4in plywood and then reinforced it for some reason. Then we added cement backerboard to the floor.\n\nUp next was putting redguard in the shower. After that, mudding and priming the bathroom walls, realizing some areas looked like shit, re-mudding, sanding, priming again, and painting. \n\nWe tiled the floors, and I didn\u2019t account for enough waste, so we ended up using exactly the number of tiles I bought, no extra. It added some stress trying not to break anything. Then we tiled the shower walls. We used thinset mortar up to where the concrete backerboard ends and used tile mastic on the other areas. We grouted and sealed the grout. \n\n At this point I felt that we were nearing the finishing, but the vanity I ordered arrived broken... and then the replacement arrived broken. Thankfully the third vanity arrived intact but we spent nearly 3 weeks just waiting on a vanity to finish the project.  So after the toilet install and vanity install, we added trim and finishing touches. I'm still waiting for a matching mirror but  I was too excited not to share. \n\n**Cost breakdown: $3,358**\n\nDumpster: 294.20\n\nPlumbing, Venting, Misc: 433.24\n\nExhaust Fan: 99.00\n\nGFCI outlet: 15.37\n\nHumidity sensing switch: 36.26 \n\nWood glue: 15.97\n\nTub: 145.00\n\nDathtub drain kit: 37.99\n\n2nd bath drain kit- 18.97 (messed up the first)\n\nStuds: 23.75\n\nGreenboard drywall: 25.14\n\nCement board screws: 9.40\n\nCement Board: 1/4 in 29.91 1/2 in 43.88\n\nDrywall screws: 4.10\n\nCorner bead for drywall: 2.67\n\nRedguard: 47.87\n\nCeiling Paint: 30.97\n\nWall paint: 30.97\n\nStippling Brush: 13.86\n\nGrey Subway Shower Tile: 290.25\n\nGrey Quarter round tile: 92.42\n\nLeaf style mosaic tile: 44.67\n\nMarble Threshold for shower niche: 21.98\n\nFloor Tile: 63.68\n\nMarble Threshold for floor: 9.89\n\nThinset mortar: 32.96\n\nPolyblend white grout: 25.96\n\nGrout sealer: 15.48\n\nSink Faucet: 126.09\n\nTub/Shower Faucet: 181.22\n\nVanity: 549.20\n\nToilet: 99.00\n\nBathroom Hardware Set 34.99\n\nBathroom Towel Hook 19.99\n\nShower Rod 27.73\n\nShower Curtain Hooks 12.56\n\nShower Curtain 24.99\n\nShower Curtain Liner 14.99\n\nToilet Tank Lever Oil-Rubbed Bronze 16.45\n\nBaseboard vent diffuser: 10.70\n\nLight fixture: 92.10 \n\nEstimated sales tax: 192\n\n**Total: 3,357.82**\n\n**Missing from estimate:** mastic, subfloor, new mirror\n\nThings we used and already owned and/or borrowed: All tools, new baseboards and door trim, Sheetrock 20, topping compound", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/kwrfdd/bathroom_remodel/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "HomeImprovement", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "bathroom remodel /!/ [**photo album**](https://imgur.com/a/labcqbc)\n\n**project dates:** 11/01/20- 01/06/21\n\n**location:**  ohio\n\n**cost estimate:** 3,357\n\nmy fianc\u00e9 and i just bought a fixer-upper and one of first tasks was getting the main hallway bathroom working and beautiful. both my fianc\u00e9 and i are -----> diy !!!  newbies, but we had the experience of my dad, a great handyman, to carry us through it. we began this project on 11/1/20 and finished up on 1/6/21 doing all work ourselves. my fianc\u00e9 and i are both nurses, so our schedules make it easier to devote full days to projects. \n\n**project process and details:** \n\nwe bought the house knowing that there was a pretty significant leak that ran down the pipes all the way to the basement, and originally thought it was due to the toilet flange leaking or the sink bowl being cracked. \n\nonce we gutted the room, we found the sink drain was sloped where the water would have to run uphill, so we took out more drywall to look at it. we found that when the house settled, the sink drain that went through the joists in this bathroom was partially snapped off of the main plumbing stack. what a nightmare. no wonder the previous owners stopped using this bathroom. \n\ngood news was we found the source before finishing the bathroom. we also discovered that the book shelf in the family room below it is to cover up water damage. so we did a lot of plumbing and basically recreated the entire plumbing stack. we installed the bath, and had to plumb the tub section of drain pipes twice because we messed it up.\n\nthen we got to replacing the exhaust fan and venting it to the outside (of course the old one was venting into the attic).  drilling a hole through our wood siding was a nightmare, we burned through 3 batteries trying to do it. we installed a humidity sensing fan switch because we have certain members of the household that \"forget\" to turn the fan on when showering (i now love this feature).  i ended up knocking down the texture on the ceiling, sanding and re-stippling it. the damage from removing the old fan was so great that trying to texture over it would have made it apparent that there was a hole patched. at the same time we put in a bunch of screws attaching the drywall back to the ceiling joists. the ceiling was visibly sinking in;

I will have all tools and posts ready to go. I may use quick setting concrete for the corner posts, and then I will likely hand mix a few bags at a time the whole length of the line. \n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Fence is on a constant slope, drops 6 ft over 100 ft. This doesn't seem steep enough to change my concreting at all, right? I'll cut the boards to the angle to follow the contour.\n2. How long after pouring standard 80lb quikcrete should I insert the posts? I've only poured quikcrete around wood posts before. \n3. Is it worth having a truck pour this? The yard is very hard to access (thin property line, behind house, so we would have to have them pump or buggy it to the backyard, and this would require me to have the entire project framed before the truck came, vs one section at a time. Total cost for 250ft, 4\"x6\" is \\~75 80lb bags (100 Ft X 6 In X 3 (4 inch wide)), plus another \\~40 bags for posts' deeper, wider holes= 115 bags X $2.35= $270. Add $2-400 to rent or buy a concrete mixer= $570-770. I don't see much room for a big truck to save money on that, and even if it saves me 20% or whatever it's not worth needing to frame the entire project.\n4. Any considerations of having the concrete around the fence post essentially attached to a 250 ft wall? Specifically, should I cut the control joints (the line for predetermining where the concrete will crack) in the middle of the wall, 4 ft from the posts? Should I put a joint at each side of each post to make the post more of a separate structure?\n5. Any reasons, concrete wise, that I need to do 6 ft spans rather than 8 (really about 7'6\")?

Long time lurker, first-time poster. I've tried to breakdown below an issue we are having with our shower and would love some advice. \n\n**BACKGROUND:** My husband (36M) and I (29F) recently purchased our first home. For the most part, the house is in great shape, albeit outdated in certain areas. The worst room without a doubt is the master bathroom. (Think pink and white striped wallpaper, shell shaped sinks, brass everything) I don't spend much time in this room so I had it at the bottom of my priority list in terms of renovations. I know how expensive they can be and honestly would rather spend the money elsewhere. We've been working on updating the majority of our house and between the two of us would consider us pretty handy and self sufficient when it comes to home improvement and DIY projects for the house. Showers are where I draw the line- I am not knowledgeable enough to comfortably and successfully take this on. The o\n\n**PROBLEM:** Recently I was showering and my husband was in the garage. He noticed that the ceiling in our tool room was leaking. Its directly under the master shower. We called in a plumber to assess and his assessment was that unfortunately it's going to be a rather large project. What he believes is there is an issue with the shower pan. He said it looks like the previous owners had an issue and went with a quick fix, only redoing the bottom row of tiles vs ripping it all out. He said you can see this on the tile as well as in the ceiling where they tried to add new support beams etc. to bandaid the issue. Side note: he did say the plumbing itself looks great and in tact. The plumber thinks the shower pan should be much larger and may have a crack or something wrong with it, so in order for us to fix this, we would need to rip it all out and start over if we wanted to actually solve the problem. \n\n**QUESTIONS**; Based on the photos, I would like to have some idea of what it might look like cost-wise to fix this. I understand that all the choices play a big role in this, but I also feel taken advantage of when it comes to contractors due to my age. I want to be better prepared and ask the right questions. My 2nd question is, if we are having to get the shower fully ripped out, does it make sense to rip out the bath as well? The plumber said there didn't seem to be anything wrong in the bathtub area, but I don't like baths and was really dreaming of having a massive walk in shower space whenever we did decide to renovate this room. So, I'm wondering the cost range for a project like this if we were just looking at replacing the shower and I would also love to have some idea of the cost if we were to do the shower and bath.

(think pink and white striped wallpaper, shell shaped sinks, brass everything) i don't spend much time in this room so i had it at the bottom of my priority list in terms of renovations. i know how expensive they can be and honestly would rather spend the money elsewhere. we've been working on updating the majority of our house and between the two of us would consider us pretty handy and self sufficient when it comes to home improvement and -----> diy !!!  projects for the house. showers are where i draw the line- i am not knowledgeable enough to comfortably and successfully take this on. the o\n\n**problem:** recently i was showering and my husband was in the garage. he noticed that the ceiling in our tool room was leaking. its directly under the master shower. we called in a plumber to assess and his assessment was that unfortunately it's going to be a rather large project. what he believes is there is an issue with the shower pan. he said it looks like the previous owners had an issue and went with a quick fix, only redoing the bottom row of tiles vs ripping it all out. he said you can see this on the tile as well as in the ceiling where they tried to add new support beams etc. to bandaid the issue. side note: he did say the plumbing itself looks great and in tact. the plumber thinks the shower pan should be much larger and may have a crack or something wrong with it, so in order for us to fix this, we would need to rip it all out and start over if we wanted to actually solve the problem. \n\n**questions**; based on the photos, i would like to have some idea of what it might look like cost-wise to fix this. i understand that all the choices play a big role in this, but i also feel taken advantage of when it comes to contractors due to my age. i want to be better prepared and ask the right questions. my 2nd question is, if we are having to get the shower fully ripped out, does it make sense to rip out the bath as well? the plumber said there didn't seem to be anything wrong in the bathtub area, but i don't like baths and was really dreaming of having a massive walk in shower space whenever we did decide to renovate this room. so, i'm wondering the cost range for a project like this if we were just looking at replacing the shower and i would also love to have some idea of the cost if we were to do the shower and bath. just wanting to make sure i'm logically making the right call, and what financially makes sense based on the fact that we plan to re-do the entire thing at some point.

I knew I should start from the outside of the counter and work in, and we decided to start on the long wall first, but I wasn\u2019t sure whether to start tile at the edge of the counter or upper cabinet. After a quick google search, I found that you should start your tile at the edge of the upper cabinets, which fortunately meant no miter was needed to add a horizontal portion to the Schluter Strip.\n\nWe used a level and drew a line straight down from the upper cabinet to the countertop. This line would be the outside edge of our Schluter Strip. I then applied some tile adhesive and stuck on a piece of Schluter strip that I\u2019d trimmed down to size.\n\nFrom here, we could start applying more adhesive and begin with the tile! I started applying the adhesive and tile, while my father started trying to cut some in half using the tile cutter. It took a few tries, but we eventually got some to cut right down the middle. Once we had that, we used it as a guide for the next few.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after beginning to apply tiles that we came across a spot where a complicated cut would be required. The tile needed to have a \u201cU\u201d shape cut for a 3-gang wall plate, plus another \u201cU\u201d shape cut for a single wall plate that held a phone jack. We knew this would be difficult since the bottom edge of the tile would end up being so thin, and we had literally no experience at all with the tile saw at this point. I quickly decided we would just cover up the box for the phone jack; It didn\u2019t have an ethernet cable to use for internet, and who has a home phone anymore. Even with this decision made, we still broke 4 tiles trying to get the single 3-gang box cut out\u2026 until we decided to use the first broken tile anyways since the break was relatively easy to hide under the wall plate and not very noticeable. If we\u2019d had more experience with the saw, we probably could\u2019ve gotten this to work.\n\nWith that one stubborn tile up, and my father now having some feel for how the tile saw worked, we were good to continue tiling! I was attaching the tiles, and marking them for cuts, while my father did the cutting.\n\nSeveral more annoying cuts came up, including underneath the upper cabinets because the walls came down further than the back, and around the windowsill where we decided to try cutting out part of the sill to slide the tile behind on one side, and deciding to try cutting a rounded edge around the sill on the other side (cutting a notch from the sill provided a cleaner look). Unfortunately, all of the tiles underneath our cabinets and windowsill also had to be cut in half the long way.\n\nWe finished the wall, got some pizza for lunch, and then tackled the shorter wall behind the stove. We should have started with that wall in the first place. It allowed for significantly more full tiles without any cuts, and the cuts were simple. It would\u2019ve been a much better wall to start off on when trying to learn the tools and materials.\n\nAnd with that, the tiles were up!\n\nGrouting:\n\nThat night, I washed down the tiles several times and scraped away any excess adhesive in the gaps or on the face of any tiles. I wasn\u2019t sure if we would have a chance to do the grouting the next day or not, and didn\u2019t want to let the excess adhesive set up too much before getting around to grouting.\n\nThe grouting didn\u2019t happen the next day, so the day after that we got to it; this time without my father, it was just me and my partner.\n\nFrom watching videos and reading online, I was very worried about using the Mapei Ultracolor Plus grout, since I\u2019d heard it sets up so quickly. I\u2019d read that the Mapei Keracolor U was a better grout to work with as a first-time tiler \u2013 I looked around at a bunch of the hardware stores, and nobody carried the Keracolor line so I was just going to have to make do with the fast-setting Ultracolor.\n\nI mixed up a half bag at a time since I was told to only do one wall at a time due to the speed that it could set up. We started with the short wall this time since I realized it would be easier to learn on. I applied the grout, while my partner sponged off the excess.\n\nHonestly, I think the warnings I\u2019d read about this grout were overblown. We didn\u2019t end up waiting a full 15-30 minutes like the package said because of those warnings, but I was easily able to apply all the grout to the first wall, then help my partner to clean it all off with a second sponge. By the time we cleaned up the first wall, I probably could\u2019ve still done the long wall based on the consistency of the grout. Since I\u2019d only done half of the bag though, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was enough left in the bucket and I wanted to make sure the colour perfectly matched if the pigment wasn\u2019t distributed evenly in the bag. I scraped out the remainder of the first batch of grout and put it in a plastic bag as an emergency backup, and then mixed the other half of the bag. We applied this to the long wall, which proved to be more difficult as expected. With all the small spaces, the grout float and sponge were both too large to move around everything. It would\u2019ve been nice to have a smaller float and sponge for these spots.\n\nWith that, the grouting was basically done! I\u2019d come back a couple of times to wipe off any excess haze, but that was it! Much easier than the negative reviews made that grout sound like it would be.\n\nTo be fair though, I didn\u2019t turn the heat on so it was probably only 17 degrees C (62 F) inside while we worked, which could have slowed down the curing process.\n\nAlso, a tip\u2026 Make sure you don\u2019t lean onto the stove knobs, turning a burner on. It\u2019s especially bad if you\u2019ve got garbage bags laid over top, and a bucket of water also on it. Fortunately, we realized early enough that the only damage caused was the garbage bag being fused to our water bucket.\n\n\nCaulking:\n\nNext up was caulking. I hated this. Easily my least favorite part of the project.\n\nI thought it would be like doing the corners of a tub or shower, and I\u2019d just lay down a bead, wet my finger, and run it along getting a perfect curve. But nooo, try doing that and it smears all over your countertop and tile and since it\u2019s a contrasting colour, you see every imperfection!\n\nSo I tried doing the tape trick. Piece of tape along the wall, and piece along the countertop, then run your finger across, and pull up the tape. I\u2019ve got to admit, this did work well! But was best where you have long straight lines. On the many awkward corners I had in small places, the tape trick didn\u2019t really work. I\u2019m not happy with how some of them turned out, but they\u2019re doing to have to do for now.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nOverall, we\u2019re very happy with this project! It makes a huge difference to the look and feel of our kitchen, and was quite affordable, especially for the difference that it makes!\n\nTiling isn\u2019t that difficult if you get the tools for it, and I would recommend taking on a similar project yourself! Neither my partner nor I have much DIY experience, and we\u2019re still happy with the result, even knowing about all the imperfections.\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about the project, or give some tips and tricks to make it look better next time (if there ever is a next time).

i was attaching the tiles, and marking them for cuts, while my father did the cutting.\n\nseveral more annoying cuts came up, including underneath the upper cabinets because the walls came down further than the back, and around the windowsill where we decided to try cutting out part of the sill to slide the tile behind on one side, and deciding to try cutting a rounded edge around the sill on the other side (cutting a notch from the sill provided a cleaner look). unfortunately, all of the tiles underneath our cabinets and windowsill also had to be cut in half the long way.\n\nwe finished the wall, got some pizza for lunch, and then tackled the shorter wall behind the stove. we should have started with that wall in the first place. it allowed for significantly more full tiles without any cuts, and the cuts were simple. it would\u2019ve been a much better wall to start off on when trying to learn the tools and materials.\n\nand with that, the tiles were up!\n\ngrouting:\n\nthat night, i washed down the tiles several times and scraped away any excess adhesive in the gaps or on the face of any tiles. i wasn\u2019t sure if we would have a chance to do the grouting the next day or not, and didn\u2019t want to let the excess adhesive set up too much before getting around to grouting.\n\nthe grouting didn\u2019t happen the next day, so the day after that we got to it; this time without my father, it was just me and my partner.\n\nfrom watching videos and reading online, i was very worried about using the mapei ultracolor plus grout, since i\u2019d heard it sets up so quickly. i\u2019d read that the mapei keracolor u was a better grout to work with as a first-time tiler \u2013 i looked around at a bunch of the hardware stores, and nobody carried the keracolor line so i was just going to have to make do with the fast-setting ultracolor.\n\ni mixed up a half bag at a time since i was told to only do one wall at a time due to the speed that it could set up. we started with the short wall this time since i realized it would be easier to learn on. i applied the grout, while my partner sponged off the excess.\n\nhonestly, i think the warnings i\u2019d read about this grout were overblown. we didn\u2019t end up waiting a full 15-30 minutes like the package said because of those warnings, but i was easily able to apply all the grout to the first wall, then help my partner to clean it all off with a second sponge. by the time we cleaned up the first wall, i probably could\u2019ve still done the long wall based on the consistency of the grout. since i\u2019d only done half of the bag though, i wasn\u2019t sure if there was enough left in the bucket and i wanted to make sure the colour perfectly matched if the pigment wasn\u2019t distributed evenly in the bag. i scraped out the remainder of the first batch of grout and put it in a plastic bag as an emergency backup, and then mixed the other half of the bag. we applied this to the long wall, which proved to be more difficult as expected. with all the small spaces, the grout float and sponge were both too large to move around everything. it would\u2019ve been nice to have a smaller float and sponge for these spots.\n\nwith that, the grouting was basically done! i\u2019d come back a couple of times to wipe off any excess haze, but that was it! much easier than the negative reviews made that grout sound like it would be.\n\nto be fair though, i didn\u2019t turn the heat on so it was probably only 17 degrees c (62 f) inside while we worked, which could have slowed down the curing process.\n\nalso, a tip\u2026 make sure you don\u2019t lean onto the stove knobs, turning a burner on. it\u2019s especially bad if you\u2019ve got garbage bags laid over top, and a bucket of water also on it. fortunately, we realized early enough that the only damage caused was the garbage bag being fused to our water bucket.\n\n\ncaulking:\n\nnext up was caulking. i hated this. easily my least favorite part of the project.\n\ni thought it would be like doing the corners of a tub or shower, and i\u2019d just lay down a bead, wet my finger, and run it along getting a perfect curve. but nooo, try doing that and it smears all over your countertop and tile and since it\u2019s a contrasting colour, you see every imperfection!\n\nso i tried doing the tape trick. piece of tape along the wall, and piece along the countertop, then run your finger across, and pull up the tape. i\u2019ve got to admit, this did work well! but was best where you have long straight lines. on the many awkward corners i had in small places, the tape trick didn\u2019t really work. i\u2019m not happy with how some of them turned out, but they\u2019re doing to have to do for now.\n\n\nfinal thoughts:\n\noverall, we\u2019re very happy with this project! it makes a huge difference to the look and feel of our kitchen, and was quite affordable, especially for the difference that it makes!\n\ntiling isn\u2019t that difficult if you get the tools for it, and i would recommend taking on a similar project yourself! neither my partner nor i have much -----> diy !!!  experience, and we\u2019re still happy with the result, even knowing about all the imperfections.\n\n\nfeel free to ask any questions about the project, or give some tips and tricks to make it look better next time (if there ever is a next time). i'll be on and off throughout the day, and will try to respond as i can.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 8, "media": "self", "medialink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/nkt4fc/our_victoria_day_weekend_backsplash_project/", "identifyer": 180832, "year": "2021"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 180874, "autor": "thiccaz", "date": 1619583140000, "content": "How to fix / seal roof? /!/ Located in Ontario, Canada. \n\nHi folks, I'm new to the sub and very inexperienced when it comes to doing home repairs or anything DIY related so any advice would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nSquirrels broke into the dormer roof and we had animal control come in to install a fence and a one way door.

As our stuff has not been delivered yet we took it as a great opportunity to refinish the white oak floors, some areas were already sanded through to bare wood. I realized it was a huge amount of work but I was looking forward to learning and didn\u2019t expect a perfect job. \n\nUnfortunately things took a turn for the worse right at the start. My contractor neighbor inspected the floors prior to us started and suggested they were flat enough to not needed heavy leveling/sanding, and because many people said they were fool proof we rented one of the larger three disc orbital sanders below:\n\n[random orbital sander equipment ](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Clarke-American-Sanders-Random-Orbit-Floor-Sander-07163A/309005835)\n\nWe started with 36 grit and successfully did one room, however we thought we could expedite the finish removal by switching to 24grit. Didn\u2019t see a problem. We thought it was going well until we inspected the floor close up and found these scratches from the orbital: \n [Scratch/floor images ](https://imgur.com/a/OhfOchX)\n\nThey are all over the main acreage. As seen in the image there noticeable up close but not too significant from standing view. We\u2019re in desperate need of some help. Main questions: \n\n1. What could have caused this? I was under the impression these sanders were \u201cfoolproof but I\u2019m finding out the hard way no. My neighbor helped me inspect the tool and we noticed one of the discs was building up fast with sand, we assumed that may have caused a tilt. Also not sure if we were pulling the equipment around too fast causing the grits to drag. Too low of a grit?\n\n2. What\u2019s the best path forward? Unfortunately because they\u2019re deep, I\u2019m assuming we need to just knuckle down and sand until they\u2019re gone. I got scared of more damage and exchanged for a square buffer sander - it\u2019s working somewhat but VERY slow, thinking about switching back to another orbital and taking it slow.

Cost and item breakdown at the end.\n\n\n\nMy husband and I have always been grateful that if we have to have 1960s tile in our bathroom, at least it's black and white and somewhat on trend all the time. We haven't decided what to do bath/shower and floor-wise in the future so we decided to give the bathroom some upgrades now.\n\n\n\nI started by cleaning the grout - a task that had obviously been neglected since install - by using Barkeeper's Friend powder and a stiff brush. This stuff is a miracle and I don't know how I've gotten through life until now without it. Minus a few hairline cracks and some missing grout, the tile basically looked brand new after cleaning.\n\n\n\nNext we replaced our toilet with basically the same toilet. The sole reason was that I loathe unskirted toilets and an added benefit was that we have a sketchy kidnapper's dream bathroom in the basement that needs a new toilet, so the old one will go there. This was probably the easiest step of the facelift. Don't hire someone for a normal toilet unless you aren't physically capable or are moving it - very much a beginner DIY task.\n\n\n\nA few months later our incorrect custom vanity had arrived and two months after that the correct counter arrived. Spent a day removing the old vanity and medicine cabinet and installing the new ones. This was where some anticipated problems arose. The elbow pipe was galvanized and the pipe coming out of the wall was copper and the incompatible metals had caused the threads on the copper to corrode. I regret not taking pics of the state of the plumbing but we ended up replacing all of it from the vertical pipe coming up from the basement to the sink. The amount of crud in the pipes after 60 years of no attention was vomit inducing. We were lucky the drawers cleared the plumbing but we were prepared to relocate it if we'd needed to. Once the plumbing was good to go, we just had to cut the tile baseboard out to accommodate the new and much wider, taller, and deeper vanity.\n\n\n\nNext step was to take out the old medicine cabinet and prep the wall for the new larger medicine cabinet that was in-stock ready-to-ship upon order and OOS immediately after ordering and took about 4390530 years to arrive from Pottery Barn (never again). The main issue with the medicine cabinet and light was that the new vanity was centered about 4 inches of the old one, so everything above it needed to be relocated. This couldn't be avoided as we had more room to the right of the old vanity to fit the new one. We basically cut out and sistered-in studs where we needed them for the new mirror and shifted the lighting electrical to its new location. Again, regret not taking pics of this.\n\n\n\nNext was lots of spackling, sanding, hanging various towels bars and accessories, replacing the original door with a paneled one to match the rest of our house, and painting. It came out exactly how I had envisioned and even though it's technically more cramped due to the large vanity, it somehow FEELS bigger because there is so much more useful space. The tile floor looks like it was put in to coordinate with the room now and I'm even happy with the faux-granite counter I was hesitant about. It never looks dirty, it won't stain, and doesn't need any maintenance. I was also nervous about black hardware and being too \"modern-farmhouse-minus-the-farm\" but I love it with the tile and don't mind dusting it constantly.\n\n\n\nSorry for the lack of pictures but there is basically one angle you can take a picture from in our bathroom.

In fact, it's probably one of the most commonly discovered metals in the United States. From ceiling tiles to floor tiles to pipe insulation, Asbestos is present in more than likely all structures in the country. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most dangerous metals in the world and must be properly removed and disposed of in a way that doesn't put people at risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most effective method of [**Asbestos Removal**](https://www.asbestossafety.gov.au/removal-and-disposal/diy-removal-requirements) and Asbestos Disposal is through the use of trained asbestos abatement specialists. These professionals have training and certification in order to safely dispose of Asbestos containing materials. In fact, many federal regulations require Asbestos contractors to obtain both local and federal regulations certification when they are engaged in Asbestos abatement work. In this way, they are protecting themselves and their customers by ensuring that Asbestos Disposal is done in a proper manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen contacted by a customer about Asbestos Removal and Asbestos Disposal, most companies will ask that the client personally remove the materials contaminated with Asbestos from his or her home or business. This is a completely reasonable request as Asbestos fibers are quite small, often invisible to the naked eye. Therefore, no matter where Asbestos is located in the house or if a person is exposed to Asbestos materials, it is almost certain that the fibers will be detected. However, companies will often suggest that their customers dispose of Asbestos containing materials in whichever way is most cost-effective to them, and that may mean disposing of Asbestos containing materials in a manner that places the least amount of stress on those who are exposed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are multiple federal regulations that have been placed on Asbestos disposal. These regulations are in place to ensure Asbestos is properly disposed of. Asbestos disposal involves following specific guidelines that were designed to protect the public from exposure to Asbestos. The first step to properly disposing of Asbestos is to identify the location of the Asbestos contamination, and then make sure Asbestos containing materials are packed and taken to a safe location for Asbestos disposal. Following these steps can help ensure the safety of Asbestos waste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second step to properly disposing of Asbestos-contaminated materials is to take precautions to protect the Asbestos users themselves. For instance, buildings containing Asbestos materials should be planned to take Asbestos-removal measures, and employees should wear masks to prevent Asbestos exposure. In addition to wearing masks, Asbestos users should also use personal protective equipment designed to protect their lungs. The EPA has also developed numerous standards for Asbestos disposal and has information regarding the safety of handling Asbestos-containing materials. These standards are designed to protect Asbestos users, provide information concerning the health risk of Asbestos use, and set standards for monitoring Asbestos disposal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Asbestos abatement process generally involves two steps: abatement cleaning and decontamination. Abatement [**cleaning**](https://sydneyasbestos.com) will typically require a licensed professional to come out to the job site and remove Asbestos-containing materials on your own. Decontamination will usually involve a licensed professional coming out to the job site and using an industrial degreaser to completely dry out any Asbestos-laden materials. Once the Asbestos-laden materials have been completely removed, the abatement contractor will dispose of it in one of two ways - he/she may bag or wrap the materials, and transport it to a landfill site, or he/she may use aazine to break down the Asbestos waste into smaller particles that can be recycled or used for other construction projects. This second option is typically used when the Asbestos abatement project is very large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisposal of Asbestos waste is regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The TSCA regulations outline acceptable Asbestos disposal methods and are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Many states also have their own versions of the TSCA regulations. Many local governments also have their own rules and regulations pertaining to Asbestos removal, disposal, and protection. It is best to contact a qualified asbestos abatement/removal contractor to discuss your removal project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen hiring an abatement/removal contractor to handle your Asbestos containing material project, you should first make sure that the contractor has the proper training and that he/she has received certification for Asbestos removal and/or abatement. Then, you should ask any questions that you have about the project and ensure that the contractor is able to answer them. Finally, you should verify that your contractor is working in accordance with all of your state and county laws.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/p5s03h/asbestos_removal/", "origin": "Reddit", "suborigin": "HomeImprovement", "result": true, "Selector": "diy", "selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "asbestos removal /!/ companies that provide asbestos removal and asbestos disposal services understand the hazardous nature of asbestos and how it can easily be introduced to a home or business. in fact, it's probably one of the most commonly discovered metals in the united states. from ceiling tiles to floor tiles to pipe insulation, asbestos is present in more than likely all structures in the country. unfortunately, it is also one of the most dangerous metals in the world and must be properly removed and disposed of in a way that doesn't put people at risk.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe most effective method of [**asbestos removal**](https://www.asbestossafety.gov.au/removal-and-disposal/-----> diy !!! -removal-requirements) and asbestos disposal is through the use of trained asbestos abatement specialists. these professionals have training and certification in order to safely dispose of asbestos containing materials. in fact, many federal regulations require asbestos contractors to obtain both local and federal regulations certification when they are engaged in asbestos abatement work. in this way, they are protecting themselves and their customers by ensuring that asbestos disposal is done in a proper manner.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nwhen contacted by a customer about asbestos removal and asbestos disposal, most companies will ask that the client personally remove the materials contaminated with asbestos from his or her home or business. this is a completely reasonable request as asbestos fibers are quite small, often invisible to the naked eye. therefore, no matter where asbestos is located in the house or if a person is exposed to asbestos materials, it is almost certain that the fibers will be detected. however, companies will often suggest that their customers dispose of asbestos containing materials in whichever way is most cost-effective to them, and that may mean disposing of asbestos containing materials in a manner that places the least amount of stress on those who are exposed.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthere are multiple federal regulations that have been placed on asbestos disposal. these regulations are in place to ensure asbestos is properly disposed of. asbestos disposal involves following specific guidelines that were designed to protect the public from exposure to asbestos. the first step to properly disposing of asbestos is to identify the location of the asbestos contamination, and then make sure asbestos containing materials are packed and taken to a safe location for asbestos disposal. following these steps can help ensure the safety of asbestos waste.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe second step to properly disposing of asbestos-contaminated materials is to take precautions to protect the asbestos users themselves. for instance, buildings containing asbestos materials should be planned to take asbestos-removal measures, and employees should wear masks to prevent asbestos exposure. in addition to wearing masks, asbestos users should also use personal protective equipment designed to protect their lungs. the epa has also developed numerous standards for asbestos disposal and has information regarding the safety of handling asbestos-containing materials. these standards are designed to protect asbestos users, provide information concerning the health risk of asbestos use, and set standards for monitoring asbestos disposal.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe asbestos abatement process generally involves two steps: abatement cleaning and decontamination. abatement [**cleaning**](https://sydneyasbestos.com) will typically require a licensed professional to come out to the job site and remove asbestos-containing materials on your own. decontamination will usually involve a licensed professional coming out to the job site and using an industrial degreaser to completely dry out any asbestos-laden materials. once the asbestos-laden materials have been completely removed, the abatement contractor will dispose of it in one of two ways -

I\u2019m not planning on doing any plumbing aside from refitting new shower fixtures myself. I\u2019m comfortable using this room to sloooowly teach myself framing, drywall, tiling, and all the little bits that go with it (because there is a second bathroom with a shower, thank god). But I\u2019m seeing all this damage on the inner side of the exterior wall and I am not sure how to tell if structural elements can be treated or just need to be replaced. \n\nSo my ACTUAL QUESTIONS:\n\n1) Since I am finding SO MUCH mold, I want to set up a plastic barrier separating the workspace from the rest of the bathroom and my home. I\u2019m assuming I should also be wearing a general worker\u2019s filter mask when I\u2019m in there to limit my exposure. Is it as simple as this, or is there something else I need to do to be safe?\n\n2) Am I right that I need an expert\u2019s help to assess this damage? What kind of contractor would I need to hire? Can I go GC for this, or is there a more applicable  specialty that I haven\u2019t heard of yet?\n\n3) Is this the time to call my homeowners insurance? I\u2019m figuring out the policy still - first time homeowner and all - and I\u2019m not sure what words to look for to find out if this is covered at all, and if it is, when is it a good idea to call them?\n\n4) Can someone help me understand the layers I\u2019m seeing and if they\u2019re straight up inadequate, or just old? From start to where I\u2019ve gotten now, I\u2019m seeing grouted tile, thinset, drywall (with cardboard facing on both sides), two-layer aluminum foil insulation, and then framing and what I assume is exterior wall. Plus bonus spare tile underneath the window to...add height? I don\u2019t know. Am I crazy or is there definitely no vapor barrier? Why would someone tile on cardboard-coated drywall? Are these the product of ancient building codes or just shoddy work? I\u2019m learning so much but it\u2019s all jumbled up in my brain right now so maybe this question is word salad!\n\n5) Is there anything else I\u2019m missing that you think I should know?

Since he was charging me double to do this work before the start of his heating season (his truck was still outfitted for A/C repairs), he spent the whole time training me on how to DIY a basic tuneup.  I'm sharing this knowledge with the community.  The below is for one-pipe steam, but maybe someone in the comments can highlight the differences with a 2-pipe system.\n\nFirst off, if you've never had your boiler maintained, we'll get through it together.  The worst case scenario is that you do all this work and then find that your boiler's shot and the whole thing needs to be replaced.  That's well outside the scope of DIY, and in my case the quote was $5000 installed for a brand new boiler.\n\nYou'll need a bottle of boiler cleaner (check the manual for your boiler to see if there's a preferred cleaner, or ask your plumbing supply), pipe wrench, flexible brushes, screwdrivers, a few buckets, a shopvac, and possibly a propane torch to heat up anything that's really stuck.  If you have any copper lines, get some solder and flux too.  Learn the hours of your local plumbing supply, they will be your best friends during this process.  Bring old parts to them, and they'll get you the perfect replacements.\n\nSteam heat operates on the principle of pressure against gravity.  Flames boil a few gallons of water into lots of steam.  Steam rises, pushing air out of the way.  That cold air comes out your vents, which seal shut once they get hot.  Once all the vents are shut, your system starts building pressure.  The pressuretrol cycles the burner within a set range.  The most common range is 1.5psi cut-out, 0.5psi cut-in; but could be different if you have to travel higher than a 2nd story.  Pressure in this case is working against gravity, and that force is pretty weak when you're talking about steam so a little bit goes a long way.\n\nFresh water coming into the system introduces 2 things: dissolved solids and dissolved air.  Dissolved solids precipitate out of solution, and dissolved air causes oxidation and acidic corrosion.  All of this contributes to the buildup of sediment, or \"boiler mud.\"  That mud is what we want to get OUT of the system.\n\nYour pipes are probably configured in what's called a hartford or gifford loop.  Check out https://ccpia.org/hartford-loop/.  We'll be referring to the pipe diagram on that page for naming conventions.\n\nFirst start by finding your drain valves.  On my boiler there's 2: one on the wet return, and another on the boiler itself.  If either valve doesn't open, or water doesn't come out after you've opened it, replace the valve.  Drain out all the nasty water and close up your valves.\n\nFind your pressure relief valve and remove it.  It's usually at the highest place on the boiler body.  If its clogged, use the brush to unclog it.\n\nFind your manual fill valve.  Open it and fill your boiler up to the top.  Again, make sure all your valves are closed.  If the boiler starts to leak out the bottom, stop and call someone to replace the boiler.  The acids/oxidation I mentioned above have eaten a hole through your tank, and that's not fixable.  If not, observe all the valves you opened and make sure they're not dripping.  Replace bad valves as needed.  Drain the water again.\n\nRemove your pressure relief valve, low-water cutoff, and pressuretrol pigtail.  Clean everything thoroughly with fresh water and reinstall after you've made sure nothing's clogged with mud.  Don't reinstall the pressure relief valve.\n\nI used Comstar Steam Clean, so this is procedure I followed.  Different chemicals have different directions, so consult your bottle.  Add water to boiler up to the recommended level on the sight glass.  Add chemical through pressure relief until the water turns green.  Drain until the water runs clear.  Reinstall pressure relief valve.\n\nFire up your boiler.  Crank the thermostat to an unreasonable temperature, or just short the terminals down by the boiler with a little jumper wire.  Make sure your damper opened, and the flames are nice and blue.  Observe the level of the water in the sight glass.  Make sure it's not surging too much.  Half an inch of surge is the limit of normal.\n\nFollow the steam main to find your main vents.  Make sure the vents are letting air out, but seal tight once they get hot.  You may also have vents on the dry return, same principle applies.\n\nObserve your radiators for the same thing.  The vents should be open when cold, sealed when hot.  Also check your radiator valves on the pipe leading into the rad.  They should be 100% open.  Don't work them unnecessarily, this makes them drip until the rust seals back up again.\n\nOnce all the vents are sealed go back to the boiler and check the pressuretrol and gauge.  If your gauge gets up to 5psi and your pressuretrol hasn't cut out yet, the pressuretrol might be bad or improperly set.  Consult its manual.\n\nWith the boiler running, drain water until the Low Water Cutoff trips.  Your burners should shut off.  If you have an autofeeder, it will trigger after a few minutes.  Make sure it does.  If you don't, let the tank cool down a little before you add cold water - the shock could crack the tank.\n\nIf your LWCO is a float-type, do this draining exercise weekly.  That keeps the float from seizing.  If it's an electrical probe type, do the draining monthly to rinse out mud.\n\nFailed main vents are almost guaranteed to be rust-welded in place, so significant leverage will be needed to work them loose.  Use a torch to heat the vent threads, and expand the metal.  If you have luck like mine, the little tube that connects the vent to your main will snap before the threads give way.  Fear not, this isn't hard to fix, just time consuming.\n\nFirst, shut off your boiler.  Then head to the plumbing supply and buy an NPT tap for the size tube you just broke.  Then go to the hardware store and get a tap handle, and some drill bits the right diameter.  Make sure the drill bits are good for cutting metal.\n\nCut off the snapped tube flush with the main pipe wall.  Oscillating saws (multitools) and angle grinders are good for this.  Add some cutting oil and drill out whatever material is still left threaded into the main.  Stop drilling and add more oil if you see smoke.  Be patient, don't heat up the bit too much.  Once you're through, tap new threads into the hole you just made.  Again, be patient.  This is not the end of the world.  Install a new tube with whatever bushings you need to match the thread on the new main vent.

"selectorShort": "diy", "MarkedSent": "how to tune up steam boiler yourself and save money! /!/ i just finished paying my hvac guy his \"i don't wanna do it\" rate to tune up my tenants' steam system.  since he was charging me double to do this work before the start of his heating season (his truck was still outfitted for a/c repairs), he spent the whole time training me on how to -----> diy !!!  a basic tuneup.  i'm sharing this knowledge with the community.  the below is for one-pipe steam, but maybe someone in the comments can highlight the differences with a 2-pipe system.\n\nfirst off, if you've never had your boiler maintained, we'll get through it together.  the worst case scenario is that you do all this work and then find that your boiler's shot and the whole thing needs to be replaced.  that's well outside the scope of diy, and in my case the quote was $5000 installed for a brand new boiler.\n\nyou'll need a bottle of boiler cleaner (check the manual for your boiler to see if there's a preferred cleaner, or ask your plumbing supply), pipe wrench, flexible brushes, screwdrivers, a few buckets, a shopvac, and possibly a propane torch to heat up anything that's really stuck.  if you have any copper lines, get some solder and flux too.  learn the hours of your local plumbing supply, they will be your best friends during this process.  bring old parts to them, and they'll get you the perfect replacements.\n\nsteam heat operates on the principle of pressure against gravity.  flames boil a few gallons of water into lots of steam.  steam rises, pushing air out of the way.  that cold air comes out your vents, which seal shut once they get hot.  once all the vents are shut, your system starts building pressure.  the pressuretrol cycles the burner within a set range.  the most common range is 1.5psi cut-out, 0.5psi cut-in; but could be different if you have to travel higher than a 2nd story.  pressure in this case is working against gravity, and that force is pretty weak when you're talking about steam so a little bit goes a long way.\n\nfresh water coming into the system introduces 2 things: dissolved solids and dissolved air.  dissolved solids precipitate out of solution, and dissolved air causes oxidation and acidic corrosion.  all of this contributes to the buildup of sediment, or \"boiler mud.\"  that mud is what we want to get out of the system.\n\nyour pipes are probably configured in what's called a hartford or gifford loop.  check out https://ccpia.org/hartford-loop/.  we'll be referring to the pipe diagram on that page for naming conventions.\n\nfirst start by finding your drain valves.  on my boiler there's 2: one on the wet return, and another on the boiler itself.  if either valve doesn't open, or water doesn't come out after you've opened it, replace the valve.  drain out all the nasty water and close up your valves.\n\nfind your pressure relief valve and remove it.  it's usually at the highest place on the boiler body.  if its clogged, use the brush to unclog it.\n\nfind your manual fill valve.  open it and fill your boiler up to the top.  again, make sure all your valves are closed.  if the boiler starts to leak out the bottom, stop and call someone to replace the boiler.  the acids/oxidation i mentioned above have eaten a hole through your tank, and that's not fixable.  if not, observe all the valves you opened and make sure they're not dripping.  replace bad valves as needed.  drain the water again.\n\nremove your pressure relief valve, low-water cutoff, and pressuretrol pigtail.  clean everything thoroughly with fresh water and reinstall after you've made sure nothing's clogged with mud.  don't reinstall the pressure relief valve.\n\ni used comstar steam clean, so this is procedure i followed.  different chemicals have different directions, so consult your bottle.  add water to boiler up to the recommended level on the sight glass.  add chemical through pressure relief until the water turns green.  drain until the water runs clear.  reinstall pressure relief valve.\n\nfire up your boiler.  crank the thermostat to an unreasonable temperature, or just short the terminals down by the boiler with a little jumper wire.  make sure your damper opened, and the flames are nice and blue.  observe the level of the water in the sight glass.  make sure it's not surging too much.  half an inch of surge is the limit of normal.\n\nfollow the steam main to find your main vents.  make sure the vents are letting air out, but seal tight once they get hot.  you may also have vents on the dry return, same principle applies.\n\nobserve your radiators for the same thing.  the vents should be open when cold, sealed when hot.  also check your radiator valves on the pipe leading into the rad.  they should be 100% open.  don't work them unnecessarily, this makes them drip until the rust seals back up again.\n\nonce all the vents are sealed go back to the boiler and check the pressuretrol and gauge.  if your gauge gets up to 5psi and your pressuretrol hasn't cut out yet, the pressuretrol might be bad or improperly set.  consult its manual.\n\nwith the boiler running, drain water until the low water cutoff trips.  your burners should shut off.  if you have an autofeeder, it will trigger after a few minutes.  make sure it does.  if you don't, let the tank cool down a little before you add cold water - the shock could crack the tank.\n\nif your lwco is a float-type, do this draining exercise weekly.  that keeps the float from seizing.  if it's an electrical probe type, do the draining monthly to rinse out mud.\n\nfailed main vents are almost guaranteed to be rust-welded in place, so significant leverage will be needed to work them loose.  use a torch to heat the vent threads, and expand the metal.  if you have luck like mine, the little tube that connects the vent to your main will snap before the threads give way.  fear not, this isn't hard to fix, just time consuming.\n\nfirst, shut off your boiler.  then head to the plumbing supply and buy an npt tap for the size tube you just broke.  then go to the hardware store and get a tap handle, and some drill bits the right diameter.  make sure the drill bits are good for cutting metal.\n\ncut off the snapped tube flush with the main pipe wall.  oscillating saws (multitools) and angle grinders are good for this.  add some cutting oil and drill out whatever material is still left threaded into the main.  stop drilling and add more oil if you see smoke.  be patient, don't heat up the bit too much.  once you're through, tap new threads into the hole you just made.  again, be patient.  this is not the end of the world.  install a new tube with whatever bushings you need to match the thread on the new main vent.  idk if pipe dope or teflon tape helps with preventing seized threads, but it makes me feel better, so i use it.\n\nif you've covered all your bases and your system is still not building pressure, you may want to consult a handyman or hvac specialist.  there could be a hole in the tank that's venting steam up the flue, but since you fill-tested the tank, that's unlikely.  there could also be a steam leak in the risers buried behind your walls.  if you want to keep diying it, an ir camera would be a good investment, but working with 1\" cast iron pipe is not for the faint of heart.\n\ngood luck, and godspeed to all of you.", "sortedWord": "None", "removed": null, "score": 1, "comments": 2, "media": "self", "medialink":

The first we decided to tackle was a 3/4 bathroom on the ground floor. It was tiny, somewhere between 25-30 square feet. You had to turn sideways to get into the shower, and it was just generally unpleasant. The chronology of the project went like this:\n\n1. The ancient, wall-mounted sink in the \"before\" photo was leaking. We looked for parts to fix it, but the fine folks at Ace kind of laughed when they saw the components of the faucet. When we looked for replacement hardware, we realized that nobody hardware that fit the sink anymore. Futhermore, we realized that only tiny wall-mounted sinks would fit in the space (the hard way, by picking up a tiny vanity-sink at Habitat, installing it, and then realizing it was now almost impossible for a large person to fit into the shower).\n2. We realized that because the left-wall of the shower faced a finished (though un-insulated) garage, we could pretty easily gain about 3 feet of space by just tearing down and installing a single wall, and relocating the sink plumbing. At this point we thought it would be a 2 or 3 weekend project. We were limited in how much re-arrangement we could do by the toilet and shower plumbing, which go through a slab foundation, and we weren't interested in that much work.\n3. We realize that the existing walls have a textured paint on them. My girlfriend hates textured walls, and certainly wasn't going to add texture to new walls. So our choice was to either skim-coat the existing walls, or tear all the drywall out, and just start from scratch. We decided to go the nuclear option and just tear it all out \\[scope creep 1\\].\n4. Drywall demo probably took 2 full days, since we weren't very experienced at this, but went smoothly\n5. We began looking at tile options for the new section of floor, and realized that the style of tile was going to be hard/impossible to match, so we again had to decide between choosing a tile that would \"nicely\" mismatch/complement, or again, go nuclear. You can guess which route we took \\[scope creep 2\\].\n6. Demo of the existing tile was a physical bear. I tried doing it by hand for 2-3 hours, but made laughable progress (tile mortared straight to slab). Watched some youtube videos, and decided to rent a demo-hammer with chisel attachment. Was able to knock the rest out in another few hours, but was still very physical work.\n7. At this point we were able to frame in the new wall, insulate, rough-in plumbing/electrical, hang dry-wall etc.\n8. Self-leveling the floor was another pain in the ass, mostly because at this point we were feeling time-crunched and a bit of project fatigue. It didn't work as well as we had hoped, and we have no idea what we did wrong. It looked like it had done a great job for the first 72 hours, but as it continued to cure, mounds/uneveness reappeared and we didn't have the willpower to do again.\n9. Our first attempt at tiling had to be aborted because followed the instructions on the mortar, and it was impossible to work with. Can't explain it, but even when we used the maximum water suggested, it was far too dry to work with, way less creamy than all the videos on youtube. We tried to work with it for 1-2 rows, but decided to abort, clean up, and try again in a few days.\n10. Second time was a success, we probably used around 10-15% more water than the maximum suggested, and it was much more reasonable.\n11. New fixtures (toilet + vanity) went in relatively smoothly\n\nNew size of bathroom: 60-ish square feet\n\nCost: around $4,000 including the new tools we had to buy for the project.
