Electrician opted to not do a pre-inspection, ran into issues with the homes ceiling/attic access, running wires through wall, duct work, not having the right tools, temperature of the attic, general frustration with the work and left the job 1 day over the estimated timeline not completing the already chopped down task list. Gave them more than half the deposit mid way through the work and they are asking for the remaining balance when only 6/16 tasks were even completed leaving several incomplete or postponed. What would you do in this situation and what do you recommend I do?\n\nFull Story\n\nBackground of the home, my house was built in the 1950s. I recently bought this home 4 years ago with my wife and discovered immediately the house needed some electrical updates. Most of the light sources in the house were non-existent or stemming from area lamps. Some rooms didn't even have overhead lighting to include our master bedroom and guest room. Assumptions could be made that whoever did the work on the additions previously wasn't very forward thinking and as a result any work on this home becomes a big project.\n\nI hired a master electrician, older gentleman, Husband/Wife company that we've employed in the past to do the following work on my home estimated at 3 days labor and $2250.00 including material. They stated they would bill on their day rate and did no pre inspection before quoting the work. We insisted that they take a look around the house/attic/basement to make sure they knew what to anticipate but they declined.\n\n16 Tasks\n\nGeneral\n\n\u2022 replace any remaining flip switches with white paddles switches (x9)\n\n\u2022 put cover on garage circuit breaker panel\n\nDen\n\n\u2022 add 2 recessed lights and convert switch to a dimmer\n\nOffice\n\n\u2022 add 2 recessed lights and new dimmer switch\n\n\u2022 add 1 light to closet\n\n\u2022 add 1 new 2 plug outlet\n\n\u2022 repair/replace 1 existing outlet\n\nKitchen\n\n\u2022 add 8 recessed lights to existing junction and convert switch to dimmer\n\n\u2022 add new switch to existing lighting to be controlled from a 3rd access point\n\nLiving Room\n\n\u2022 replace 3 existing pot lights with newly provided recessed LEDs and convert switches to dimmers\n\n\u2022 add 2 recessed lights to existing lighting/switching\n\n\u2022 add 1 recessed light with independent switch\n\n\u2022 convert a 2 plug outlet to a 4 plug outlet\n\n\u2022 add 1 new 2 plug outlet\n\n\u2022 move a switch located in the master bedroom that controls the attic light to an adjacent wall outside of the bedroom\n\n\u2022 run a C wire for a thermostat\n\nOk so I'm just going to start from the beginning from my point of view and hopefully it has some kind of cohesion to you the reader.\n\nBefore the work started, emails went back and forth about the cost and time. A final estimate was to be sent and received so that we could provide half the cost up front as a deposit before the work began. We never heard from them and had to reach out to them to request the final quote which they ultimately never sent.\n\nJune 9th, Day - 1 (4-5 hours total)\n\nThe first day the Electrician shows up an hour after the scheduled time with a helper (not an apprentice or journeyman) to assist with snaking cable and whatever else and begin casing the house. We provided them with all the recessed lighting for the tasks, provided an itemized list of what we had requested and stayed out of their way as they got to work. They spent some time preparing the recessed lighting and decided to start with the kitchen lighting first. After no exaggeration 2-3 hours of making 4 cut out holes in the ceiling it was expressed that they were running into difficulty because behind the drywall was another layer of material that was very hard to cut through with their hole saw. This material was later identified as homasote board (sound controlling board). This appeared to be installed under all of the ceiling drywall in the kitchen, likely to reduce noise from the air handler in the attic. They expressed that maybe they didn't have the right cut out tools. After all the hurdles for the day, he replaced 1-2 switches with paddle switches and called it a day stating they would have to get some different tools for cutting the holes and do some brain storming.\n\nJune 10th, Day - 2 (3 hours total)\n\nThe Electrician and help arrive on the scheduled time. The first 1-2 hours of the morning was spent attempting to drill out more cut outs from the kitchen with little to no effect. The idea of drilling down from the attic to make these recessed hole cut outs came up but was later stalled because in my attic I have decking or plywood down so you don't have easy access to the joist bays as well as duct work from the HVAC that runs all through my attic floor over key areas that would need recessed lighting or wiring installed. The electrician spent another hour drawing/sketching which boards and ducts he would need access to underneath and stated that he/helper didn't have the tools to remove the decking to gain access to the joist space. I stated that it was the middle of the work day for me but as soon as I have time I will go into the attic and start pulling nails and cutting through plywood in the 100+ degree attic to help them gain access since I had a hammer and a nail puller tool. Since the kitchen lighting was delayed again, he and the helper replaced the 3 existing pot lights with 3 newer LED recessed lights in the living room. He wired them and call it a day around 1pm stating that until the decking in the attic was removed there wasn't much more they could do for the day and that the \"Boss/wife\" told him to go on another job for the rest of the day since they were at a stopping point here. Before leaving I expressed that since the decking/ducts were posing such a challenge that we may have to postpone some of the work that we originally requested until the ducting is removed so that we weren't requesting any work that was too unreasonable or unrealistic/expensive. (We have a future project scheduled to replace the HVAC with ductless mini splits.)\n\nThat night, we get an email and a call from the \"Boss/wife\" giving us a bill for the work done so far and explains some of the challenges that the Electrician was facing and why things weren't moving along as expected. The bill was for $1470.00 thus far to include time elapsed and materials. I had expressed concern that we were getting billed at a rate that was not following the progress/timeline. When I was asked to explain I stated that given the challenges and expressed concerns/limitation of the Electrician and what we think we will have to remove from the list currently the only work that has been done was 4 cut holes in my kitchen ceiling with no lighting in them, 3 pot lights replaced with LEDs and 2 light switches replaced with paddles totaling $1470.00. I continued that they were certainly owed half of the original estimate in an effort to show good faith on our end and that I do believe work was done and should be compensated but maybe not at the original cost/ day rate projected since there seems to be a level of resistance to work on these tougher jobs. I stated there were a lot of hours clocked but not a lot to show for it in truth. She repeated that they were billing for 5 hours each day so far even though I had logged maybe 4 hours the first day and barely 3 hours the second to which she rebutted that they charge for travel time and that he calls her when he arrives and leaves. Needless to say the conversation didn't get us anywhere and we wrote the the check for the $1470.00 to show that we were being honest and genuine.\n\nJune 10th, Day - 3 (5-6 hours total)\n\nAfter spending 3-4 hours of my own time the day prior in the hot attic pulling 4 inch nails and using my circular saw to make a series of access points for the recessed lighting in the kitchen the Electrician and helper arrive on time and hit the ground running. They spend a majority of the day, 5-6 hours in the kitchen/attic cutting the rest of the recessed lighting holes, running wiring and installing dimmer switches. After a full day of working in the intense heat they called it a day and justifiably so given the temperature. The lighting in the kitchen looked amazing and we gave them much praise for their efforts. Before leaving we talked to him about what work we felt logically made sense to postpone due to the decking/duct work getting in the way of completing the tasks. We noted the following as tasks that would be completed at a later time and removed from the current tasking:\n\nDen\n\n\u2022 add 2 recessed lights and convert switch to a dimmer\n\nOffice\n\n\u2022 add 1 of recessed lights on new dimmer switch\n\n\u2022 add 1 light to closet\n\nKitchen\n\n\u2022 add new switch to existing lighting to be controlled from a 3rd access point\n\nLiving Room\n\n\u2022 add 2 recessed lights to existing lighting/switching\n\n\u2022 add 1 recessed light with independent switch\n\n\u2022 run a C wire for a thermostat\n\nJune 14th, Day - 4 (4-5 hours total)\n\nThe Electrician arrived a half hour after the scheduled time, we discussed his plan of attack on the remaining list and he began working in the office. He identified that decking and ductwork were blocking the location for the closet light and one of the recessed lights. We asked if he could just install one of the two recessed lights and add the second one on later to switch he said sure no problem (thumbs up.) After an hour or two or trying to snake a wire for the switch that would control the recessed light, he identified a crossed member in the wall preventing him from snaking the wire all the way through. He stated he would need a longer drill bit that he didn't have at the moment and would have to postpone that work. He continued with fixing a broken outlet in the office, expanded an outlet in the living room from 2 plug to 4 plug, installed the circuit breaker panel cover and finished swapping out all the remaining light switches with paddle switches. He then stated to my wife that he was frustrated and done for the day. We received a call later that day by the Boss stating that he left because he did all he could for the day and was frustrated with all of the challenges due to the decking and duct work. We stated that were was still stuff on the list that he said he could complete but had not done yet. She replied stating that if we wanted him to he could come back out maybe sometime later in the week if we really wanted those things done.\n\nSo that brings us to today, and email received for the remaining balance due of $825.00 after our initial deposit bringing the final total to $2295.00 stating that now the electrician knows the house somewhat we can get a price from him for the remainder of the work later down the road when the ducting gets removed.\n\nI asked and expected to pay for 16 tasks to be completed, identified hurdles along the way, removed 7 of the items on our list, and in the end still did not get the remaining work completed. From an overall view point, only 6 out of the original 16 items on the list were done and I'm being asked to pay more than was originally quoted.\n\nMy thoughts are that this whole thing has devolved into a shit show and given the facts, we were originally quoted for $2250.00 to do 16 tasks. I have experience as a handyman and do understand that costs, prices and timelines have to sometimes be fluid and I think hard work deserves fair compensation but in this situation I can't help but feel like I'm being billed for time spent on something that ultimately wasn't completed.\n\nPlease share with me your thoughts and feelings on the situation and thank you for taking the time to read this.

This floor slope means we can't use a floor track even if we did settle for a double sliding door.\n...) if we used a top-mounted slider set, the slop would mean the position of the doors could make a huge gap under the door if the doors were cut to the floor and bypassed each other....or would leave an uneven gap if they were cut straight.\n\nAfter waffling in it for MONTHS, and leaving the doorway unfinished and without trim (in case whatever we picked needed a specific condition),  we found the Johnson Hardware full-access bi-fold door hardware. It's a bi-fold door system, but it comes out, and folds flat against the wall to the side.\n\nHowever...\n\nThe hinges that come with the set are super ugly, and wouldn't match the hinges of the nearby doors, so we went with the mortise hinge install option and used \"normal\" hinges.\n\nI had never cut hinge mortises before. My plunge router couldn't hold a depth to save it's life, and I am TERRIBLE with a chisel. So I bought a new palm router (Yay, new power tool!), and a sharp chisel just to square up the corners.\n\nWe bought a set of hollow-core Masonite brand bi-fold doors from Home Depot.\n\nAs I started routing the mortises, I discovered just how soft/mushy the door's core material is. The sawdust was...like...fluffy. It turns out these doors are meant to hang from a track rather than side hinges, so the solid material around the perimeter is not very load-bearing and soft. I worried the screws would pull right out. I thankfully did a test by driving a screw into the bottom edge and tried to pull it out with a claw hammer. It pulled right out, with little resistance. *sigh*\n\nI have to say, I'm pretty proud of my idea...i used a toggle bolt at each hinge to spread out the load to the \"back\" of this perimeter MDF, and then still using two of the normal screws to mostly keep things aligned.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IbgWxnW\n\nI give myself a B- on six of the eight mortises, C on one, and D on the last one. The router got away from my edge guide... *sigh*\n\nThen I cut the bottom of the doors to height. I measured the sloping floor height in 7 places, subtracted the planned gap at the top, drew a line to connect the dots, and cut the bottom off on the angle. On the one end, I had to cut so much off that I cut into the hollow core. *sigh* I could have left it open, but decided to glue a block of wood inside. Lord knows I'd be the one to trip and kick the door right where there's no support and it would break, or something.\n\nSo far, so...OK, I guess. Then I needed to attach that top arm to guide the fold. I started screwing it to inside face of the door, aaaaand there was no solid material inside. So the screws had nothing to grab onto, and just spun out. *sigh*\n\nOk. So the toggle bolts for the hinges seemed to work really well, so I tried some smaller ones here, too. Of course the only ones I had had 3\" screws, so I had to cut them by squeezing a wire cutter pliers with some larger channel lock pliers because I couldn't squeeze hard enough. I had to cut 4, because one piece went flying when it cut and I lost it, and then another had the threads so screwed up the toggle wouldn't screw on. Thankfully I ended up with two, because they were my last 2 screws this size.\n\nThe screws into the door had to be very close together so I had to be really careful with the larger drill bit to be large enough fit the toggle/butterflies through, and close enough to fit the bracket on the arm.\n\nThe package of the toggle bolts said to use a 3/8\" drill bit. They are a lying pack of lying liars who lie. After \"sawing\" the holes with the sides of the drill bit, I finally got the toggles in...but they were so close to each other they played footsie inside the door, and so close to the solid border inside the door, that I had to wrestle with them to get them to settle into a good position. Like trying to so surgery on a fly with toothpicks through a window screen...or...something. \n\nI finally got them into position, after scratching the hell out of the door's paint we just finished last night.\n\nThe rest of the install was pretty straight forward.\n\nIn the end, this really was the best option for a door here, and the end result is real satisfying. I've been playing with it for most of the night.\n\nNow we just need to decide on a door pull that we like, that also won't catch on out clothing when we walk past it every day...like our bedroom

mean that we could only ever have 17.5\" of the 36\" wide doorway open at any time, which is awkward. we already have a closet like this, and itxs sort of annoying.\n...) a normal bi-fold door would

my apartment my door has a lock on it, the only way to unlock it is to unlock it from the inside, and if it\u2019s the outside there needs to be a key. No key for this particular door came with the apartment (we think this doorknob was installed by the previous tenants).
