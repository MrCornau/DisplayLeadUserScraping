The app should work with any Canon Cameras which support BR-E1 remote. The official list is 77D, 800D, 200D and 6D Mark II. I am only able to test the app with my 200D as I have only one camera. I would like to know if this app works with any other canon cameras.

I got my first mirrorless camera (Sony a6000) about 8 months ago and have purchased a few lenses including a couple lenses that are great for portraits. I try to shoot as often as possible and really, really enjoy it. I enjoy shooting landscapes and astro but also bring my camera to just about every social gathering I go to so I can get some practice with live subjects. I feel i have improved quite a bit within the past few months and am looking forward to developing my skills even more. I signed up for a live, 10-week photography class which starts after the holidays and will cover basics, give assignments which the instructors will critique, and cover post-processing in both lightroom and photoshop, as well as printing and framing. At some point, I would love to be able to turn this into a side hustle, and offer services such as senior portraits, engagement photos, family photos, etc. However, I feel uncomfortable setting prices at this point as I am very much still learning. I was thinking about offering some sort of donation based service to begin with... maybe put up an ad on craigslist, explaining my situation and goals. People they could donate how ever much they feel the service is worth. I would maybe set a suggested donation of 30-40$ for an anticipated 10-20 finished photos. I realize that may be a bit risky as perhaps there will be some people who dont feel my photos are worth any money, but I am mostly interested the opportunities to practice, especially with people I dont know so that I can become more comfortable. For those who run side hustles...  how did you get started? Does this seem like an idea that would work? Do you have any advice? Thanks in advance! ",

I ended up walking by a \"Little Free Library\" - not sure if these are \"a thing\" in other parts of the world, but my town is heavily populated with these little things that look like a small cupboard on a pole, usually filled with random books or items for passers-by to take and enjoy. It was pretty dark so I used my phone flashlight to peek inside but didn't see anything that appealed to me. However, I did notice a cardboard box on the ground next to the Little Free Library, so I peeked in the box too. The box was mostly filled with kids books written in Chinese (I think - again, it was super dark), and just as I was about to give up, I spotted something unexpected: a camera lens. I dug a little deeper, and [here's what I ended up finding at the bottom of the box](https://imgur.com/a/P6jO5Ir): a Nikon F-301 SLR camera with a Nikkor 35-105mm zoom lens, a Sunpak flash unit, a small flipbook filled with colored lenses that slot into the flash unit, and a Sigma lens which looks to my untrained eye like it's intended for a newer Canon camera. Crazy! I grabbed it all up and hurried home, probably looking suspicious as hell LOL, but it was worth it.\n\nAs you can see in the album linked above, the camera itself is in surprisingly good condition given its age (the date-stamp sticker indicates it was made in 1985) - other than a bit of easily-cleaned corrosion in the battery compartment, it looks clean. I've never used a film camera as an adult (my mom *loved* her Kodak Disc Camera when I was a kid) and so I'm hopeful that it's functional - it would be so cool to try apply some of the skills I've been developing with my Sony Alpha a6400 over the past year to this camera, if it works!\n\nHappy for any tips, suggestions, guidance, etc. - I'm completely out of my depth here but excited to play and learn!\n\n**TL;DR:** Took a walk, found a cool old camera in a box of random free children's books, now excited to get it working and shoot some pics like it's 1985 again!",
