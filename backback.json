Can anyone recommend some intermediate model that would be cheap on eBay (used is okay) but a bit of an upgrade from the Optio Z10?  The key must-haves:\n\n1. Small size, so I can fit it in a pocket\n2. Powerful optical zoom. The Z10 has 7x, though I could go a bit lower if other features are really worthwhile.\n3. Ability to focus at short distances even when zoomed in (the Z10 can focus down to about 30cm while zoomed to 7x)\n4. Flash\n5. Easy to adjust EV and ISO\n6. Decent battery life\n\nI also really appreciate the Z10's manual focus feature, for when the lighting is too low for autofocus.

At one time, I was a US retailer for FOGG, which did not help my addiction. My other bag that I rotate with the Brady is a FOGG b-Sharp or b-Minor. They are the perfect size for an M kit. Here's my current carry. I have used Brady bags for years, this one is the Brady Ariel Trout Small. I have another in all black and another in tan and khaki. Little known fact is that the founder of Billingham, Martin Billingham, used to work as the Chief Cutter for Brady, hence the resemblance on the two bag lines. Brady does not make inserts, so I picked up a nice padded one for about $15 on that auction site. Billingham is great, but there is something about Brady that appeals to me more. Maybe it is the perception that the materials used are slightly nicer than Billingham or perhaps that my good friends Tom A and Sal DiMarco used to use them exclusively. Contents: M10 with half case and Rock N Roll strap and several lenses. My lenses are stored and carried in small nylon mesh pouches I found on Amazon. I added the Leica Red drawstring with an ID tag to identify which lens is inside. You can also feel the lens through the mesh to tell by touch which lens is which. I also carry extra batteries, lens clothes, business cards, etc. in see through mesh pouches which keep things organized.

A better approach would have been for Leica to keep the integrated GPS receiver and augment it with a smartphone connection. This would help ensure a reliable signal while outdoors (i.e., when persons are most likely to want GPS tagging) while also enabling tagging in scenarios were a GPS fix is not possible (indoors, under cover, etc.). It would have also enabled Leica to work through connectivity issues without regressing functionality already found in the SL2's predecessor.

We seem to care about reliability, getting an accurate fix within a short time after waking up the camera, not having to keep multiple devices in the right and not obvious active state, and battery power. Our battery power limits seem to be carrying one extra battery and shooting over part of a day, recharging at night. That makes sense. Now how do we make our arguments match up with the priorities of Mr. Stefan Daniel and his team in Wetzlar? They probably want to see Leica Camera AG produce and maintain products that bring in enough revenue at a low enough cost to keep Mr Kaufmann and his heirs happy, so that they do not retreat to Salzburg, leaving behind an empty palace like the elegant buildings Hasselblad abandoned a few years ago in Gothenburg. And each of them is responsible for the continued employment of a fair number of people who are Leica's institutional memory. In this framework, it is possible to see why Fotos is doing the following: Write one app, which talks to a consistent interface for BT and WiFi in each camera line. I hope they are doing this in Wetzlar, where the camera engineers can talk to the app programmers, but the temptation to let it all get done by contractors in India must have been strong. Every country has a ministry of communications that only lets products be shipped into their country if they don't endanger the nation, so stick to standard chips with embedded firmware and protocols that have international acceptance. (I lost 2 months during a beta test once in such a ministry because I failed to let them think that this was just an existing product on loan.) Let the phone makers (Samsung, Motorola, HuaWei, etc) deal with the complexity of writing GPS and localization code that is fast and accurate yet still complies with national requirements not to operate too close to borders, reeducation centers in the far west, or sensitive military institutions. Then work with whatever smart phones achieve worldwide distribution. I think the next iteration will be improvements in camera firmware, not just to keep the interfaces fully standard (and standards are multifold, and evolving, so it may be necessary to get them all to a common standard standard). We can help by providing details of cases where different cameras seem to work differently, or different phones make this easy or hard. We also can help by sharing what has to be done at the phone to make connection work in fewer tries and to keep the localization interface alive while moving around. Leica is risking its reputation for only doing things in a simple, \"right\" way by allowing a public beta, and we can help if we keep their needs in mind as well as our own.",

So you only get a blury picture - you often can't click the trigger on the phone...until you triggered manualy on the camera - the bluetooth connection is getting lost randomly. And then you can'T reconnect. YOu have to reset both camera and phone to make it work again. This happens mostly with pictures and not so much with video. Takes about 10 minutes and 3 grey hairs to do that. god, how I hate this app. Any viable alternatives? After lots of trouble with the initial App, when the update came along, I deleted the old App and did a clean ReInstall, in addition I cleared all the previous Wi-Fi & BT settings on my camera.. I rebooted both camera & iPhone.. then I reset the Wi-Fi & BT settings on the camera.. Since then, mostly everything works ok, connection sometimes takes 2 goes.. I only use FOTOS for image transfers, but the other bits n pieces do work.. L",

The camera takes this GPS data and writes it into the RAW file at the point of capture (ie it's not added to the file afterwards). It works maybe 90% of the time, but occasionally the phone and the camera will disconnect from each other, so you end up performing a silly dance where you turn off the camera, turn it back on, turn off your phone's bluetooth, back on again, etc. Annoying. On my Leica Q2, I was hoping for a similar feature via the Fotos app, but as many have found out, it only works for photos that are taken using the app. When they eventually add the feature to cover all photos taken with the camera, my hope is that it doesn't require a direct WiFi connection to the camera and just work over bluetooth. In the interim, I have downloaded an iPhone app named Geotag Photos Pro 2 (I believe there is an Android version too). It's great and it does the job beautifully. First you need to set the time on your camera as closely as possible to your phone - on the iPhone you can watch the second hand on the clock icon to help with this. You should only need to do this once. Then in the Geotag app you create a ‘trip’ when you're ready to use your camera. It records your location at preset (adjustable) intervals, then when you're done for the day you simply end the trip on the app and it exports a GPX file to the cloud service of your choice. You can then either download their companion desktop app to write the GPS data into the metadata of the RAW files, or you can just do it directly in Lightroom as I do. For the Lightroom route, you simply go to the 'Map' view in Lightroom, click the 'GPS Tracklogs' button at the bottom (looks like a zig-zag, next to the lock icon), select 'Load Tracklog' and open the GPX file from your 'trip' which should be on your cloud drive. From the same popup menu, click 'Select photos on Tracklog' then 'Auto-tag X Selected Photos' to add the GPS data to each photo. The beauty of the DNG format used by Leica is that this metadata can be written into the file without corrupting the image, unlike other RAW formats where any modification to the file is always at your own risk.",

The main reason for the EVF is because I like to have GPS tagging for traveling. It is easier for me to organize my exported photos in iOS.

This is certainly a step in the right direction. Requiring the user to be (actively) using the app for GeoTag to work (as was previously the case IIRC) is indicative of not thinking through the use case very well, IMO. However, based on very limited usage and experimentation, it appears that the app process still needs to be running in order for the GPS tagging feature to work (as indicated by the satellite icon on the camera's display). It need not in the foreground (i.e, actively using), but if (1) you kill the app by swiping it up or (2) iOS memory management kicks in and closes the app to reclaim memory, then the feature no longer works. I don't have any mileage on the latest updates, but will see how goes. Hopefully, I suspect, if loading up the app at the start of a day of shooting, and occasionally through out day to keep it from getting closed in the background, then should be OK, assuming everything else is OK. Of course, Bluetooth needs to be enabled and Camera paired too -- so the Bluetooth icon showing on the Camera display is a precondition for the GPS satellite icon/indicator to show.
